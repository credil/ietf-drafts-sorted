Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework             October 2009 
    

Abstract 

   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is 
   based on a profile of the MPLS and pseudowire (PW) procedures as 
   specified in the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE), pseudowire (PW) 
   and multi-segment PW (MS-PW) architectures complemented with 
   additional Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) 
   procedures for fault, performance and protection-switching management 
   for packet transport applications that do not rely on the presence of 
   a control plane. 

   This document describes a framework to support a comprehensive set of 
   OAM procedures that fulfills the MPLS-TP OAM requirements [12].

1. Introduction 

   As noted in [8], MPLS-TP defines a profile of the MPLS-TE and (MS-)PW 
   architectures defined in RFC 3031 [2], RFC 3985 [5] and [7] which is 
   complemented with additional OAM mechanisms and procedures for alarm, 
   fault, performance and protection-switching management for packet 
   transport applications. 

   [Editor's note - The draft needs to be reviewed to ensure support of 
   OAM for p2mp transport paths] 

   In line with [13], existing MPLS OAM mechanisms will be used wherever 
   possible and extensions or new OAM mechanisms will be defined only 
   where existing mechanisms are not sufficient to meet the 
   requirements. 

   The MPLS-TP OAM framework defined in this document provides a 
   comprehensive set of OAM procedures that satisfy the MPLS-TP OAM 
   requirements [12]. In this regard, it defines similar OAM 
   functionality as for existing SONET/SDH and OTN OAM mechanisms (e.g. 
   [16]).

2.2. Definitions 

   Note - the definitions in this section are intended to be in line 
   with ITU-T recommendation Y.1731 in order to have a common, 
   unambiguous terminology. They do not however intend to imply a 
   certain implementation but rather serve as a framework to describe 
   the necessary OAM functions for MPLS-TP. 

   Domain Border Node (DBN): An LSP intermediate MPLS-TP node (LSR) that 
   is at the boundary of an MPLS-TP OAM domain. Such a node may be 
   present on the edge of two domains or may be connected by a link to 
   an MPLS-TP node in another OAM domain. 

   Maintenance Entity (ME): Some portion of a transport path that 
   requires management bounded by two points, and the relationship 
   between those points to which maintenance and monitoring operations 
   apply (details in section 3.1).  

   Maintenance Entity Group (MEG): The set of one or more maintenance 
   entities that maintain and monitor a transport path in an OAM domain. 

   MEP: A MEG end point (MEP) is capable of initiating (MEP Source) and 
   terminating (MEP Sink) OAM messages for fault management and 
   performance monitoring. MEPs reside at the boundaries of an ME 
   (details in section 3.2).  

   MEP Source: A MEP acts as MEP source for an OAM message when it  
   originates and inserts the message into the transport path for its 
   associated MEG. 

   MEP Sink: A MEP acts as a MEP sink for an OAM message when it 
   terminates and processes the messages received from its associated 
   MEG. 

   MIP: A MEG intermediate point (MIP) terminates and processes OAM 
   messages and may generate OAM messages in reaction to received OAM

   messages. It never generates unsolicited OAM messages itself. A MIP 
   resides within an MEG between MEPs (details in section 3.2). 

   OAM domain: A domain, as defined in [11], whose entities are grouped 
   for the purpose of keeping the OAM confined within that domain. 

   Note - within the rest of this document the term "domain" is used to 
   indicate an "OAM domain" 

   OAM flow: Is the set of all OAM messages originating with a specific 
   MEP that instrument one direction of a MEG. 

   OAM information element: An atomic piece of information exchanged 
   between MEPs in MEG used by an OAM application. 

   OAM Message: One or more  OAM information elements that when 
   exchanged between MEPs or between MEPs and MIPs performs some OAM 
   functionality (e.g. continuity check or connectivity verification) 

   OAM Packet: A packet that carries one or more OAM messages (i.e. OAM 
   information elements). 

   Path: See Transport Path 

   Signal Fail: A condition declared by a MEP when the data forwarding 
   capability associated with a transport path has failed, e.g. loss of 
   continuity.  

   Tandem Connection: A tandem connection is an arbitrary part of a 
   transport path that can be monitored (via OAM) independently from the 
   end-to-end monitoring (OAM). The tandem connection may also include 
   the forwarding engine(s) of the node(s) at the boundaries of the 
   tandem connection.  

   The following terms are defined in RFC 5654 [11] as follows: 

   Associated bidirectional path: A path that supports traffic flow in 
   both directions but that is constructed from a pair of unidirectional 
   paths (one for each direction) that are associated with one another 
   at the path's ingress/egress points.  The forward and backward 
   directions are setup, monitored, and protected independently. As a 
   consequence, they may or may not follow the same route (links and 
   nodes) across the network.  

   Concatenated Segment: A serial-compound link connection as defined in 
   G.805 [17]. A concatenated segment is a contiguous part of an LSP or

   multi-segment PW that comprises a set of segments and their 
   interconnecting nodes in sequence.  See also "Segment". 

   Co-routed bidirectional path: A path where the forward and backward 
   directions follow the same route (links and nodes) across the 
   network.  Both directions are setup, monitored and protected as a 
   single entity.  A transport network path is typically co-routed. 

   Layer network: Layer network is defined in G.805 [17]. A layer 
   network provides for the transfer of client information and 
   independent operation of the client OAM.  A layer network may be 
   described in a service context as follows: one layer network may 
   provide a (transport) service to higher client layer network and may, 
   in turn, be a client to a lower-layer network.  A layer network is a 
   logical construction somewhat independent of arrangement or 
   composition of physical network elements.  A particular physical 
   network element may topologically belong to more than one layer 
   network, depending on the actions it takes on the encapsulation 
   associated with the logical layers (e.g., the label stack), and thus 
   could be modeled as multiple logical elements.  A layer network may 
   consist of one or more sublayers.  Section 1.4 (of RFC 5654) provides 
   a more detailed overview of what constitutes a layer network.  For 
   additional explanation of how layer networks relate to the OSI 
   concept of layering, see Appendix I of Y.2611 [19]. 

   Section Layer Network: A section layer is a server layer (which may 
   be MPLS-TP or a different technology) that provides for the transfer 
   of the section-layer client information between adjacent nodes in the 
   transport-path layer or transport service layer.  A section layer may 
   provide for aggregation of multiple MPLS-TP clients.  Note that G.805 
   [17] defines the section layer as one of the two layer networks in a 
   transmission-media layer network.  The other layer network is the 
   physical-media layer network. 

   Path: See Transport Path 

   Segment: A link connection as defined in G.805 [17]. A segment is the 
   part of an LSP that traverses a single link or the part of a PW that 
   traverses a single link (i.e., that connects a pair of adjacent 
   {Switching|Terminating} Provider Edges). See also "Concatenated 
   Segment". [editors: concept should be layer specific.. suggesting 
   that the part of a PW that traverses a single physical link is a 
   segment means a segment is pretty much bounded by duct ends, and by 
   devices completely clueless as to the existence of the PW, visibility 
   of the wrong layer, To group: we have a definition conflict between 
   G.805 and usage of segment in IETF (e.g. PWE3), not sure how to 
   resolve this, for discussion Nov 3]

   Sublayer: Sublayer is defined in G.805 [17]. The distinction between 
   a layer network and a sublayer is that a sublayer is not directly 
   accessible to clients outside of its encapsulating layer network and 
   offers no direct transport service for a higher layer (client) 
   network. [editors: messy definition as it is context specific. Given 
   MPLS has no PID, the transport path will always exist in a sublayer 
   as the PW or PID label which has no forwarding context will be bottom 
   of stack. Whether or not you actually think of the PW label as being 
   a sublayer itself entirely dependant on usage SS or MS-PW, for 
   discussion Nov 3rd]  

   Transport Path: A network connection as defined in G.805 [17]. In an 
   MPLS-TP environment, a transport path corresponds to an LSP or a PW. 

   Transport Path Layer: A (sub)layer network that provides 
   point-to-point or point-to-multipoint transport paths.  It is 
   instrumented with OAM mechanisms that are independent of the clients 
   it is transporting. [editor: if you look at the sublayer discussion 
   above, this term pretty much universally must be a transport path 
   sub-layer. The transport path cannot be a layer to itself in the 
   MPLS_TP architecture unless we are discussing multi-segment dry 
   martini, for discussion Nov 3rd]  

   Unidirectional path: A path that supports traffic flow in only one 
   direction. 

   The term 'Per-hop Behavior' is defined in [14] as follows: 

   Per-hop Behavior: a description of the externally observable 
   forwarding treatment applied at a differentiated services-compliant 
   node to a behavior aggregate. 

3. Functional Components 

   MPLS-TP defines a profile of the MPLS and PW architectures ([2], [5] 
   and [7])  that is designed to transport service traffic where the 
   characteristics of information transfer between the transport path 
   endpoints can be demonstrated to comply with certain performance and 
   quality guarantees. In order to verify and maintain these performance 
   and quality guarantees, there is a need to not only apply OAM 
   functionality on a transport path granularity (e.g. LSP or MS-PW), 
   but also on arbitrary parts of transport paths, defined as Tandem 
   Connections, between any two arbitrary points along a path.  

   In order to describe the required OAM functionality, this document 
   introduces a set of high-level functional components. [Note - 
   discussion in Munich -tues concluded that TCM not possible with PWs - 
 
 
Busi et al.            Expires April 26, 2010                 [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework             October 2009 
    

   can monitor a single PW segment - but attempting to monitor more than 
   one segment converts the PW into an LSP and therefore the intervening 
   SPEs are unable to see the PW as a PW due to the differences in how 
   OAM flows are disambiguated.] [editors: if true this IMO is a huge 
   problem as the one place I would really want TCM is a multi-domain 
   MS-PW, else I have to control plane peer at two layers, for 
   discussion Nov 3rd] 

   When a control plane is not present, the management plane configures 
   these functional components. Otherwise they can be configured either 
   by the management plane or by the control plane. 

   These functional components should be instantiated when the path is 
   created by either the management plane or by the control plane (if 
   present). Some components may be instantiated after the path is 
   initially created (e.g. TCM). 

3.1. Maintenance Entity (ME) and Maintenance Entity Group (MEG) 

   [editors: rather than fight chicken and egg, we made two sections 
   into one] 

   MPLS-TP OAM operates in the context of Maintenance Entities (MEs) 
   that are a relationship between two points of a point to point 
   [editors: why has this restriction been added, for discussion Nov 3rd]
   transport path to which maintenance and monitoring operations 
   apply. These two points are called Maintenance Entity Group End 
   Points (MEPs). In between these two points zero or more intermediate 
   points, called Maintenance Entity Group MEG Intermediate Points 
   (MIPS), MAY exist and can be shared by more than one ME in a MEG.  

   The MEPs that form an MEG are configured and managed to limit the 
   scope of an OAM flow within the MEG the MEPs belong to (i.e. within 
   the domain of the transport path or segment, in the specific layer 
   network, that is being monitored and managed). A misbranching fault 
   may cause OAM packets to be delivered to a MEP that is not in the MEG 
   of origin.  

   The abstract reference model for an ME with MEPs and MIPs is 
   described in Figure 1 below: 

    
                            +-+    +-+    +-+    +-+ 
                            |A|----|B|----|C|----|D| 
                            +-+    +-+    +-+    +-+ 
    
                   Figure 1 ME Abstract Reference Model

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework             October 2009 
    

   The instantiation of this abstract model to different MPLS-TP 
   entities is described in section 4. In this model, nodes A, B, C and 
   D can be LER/LSR for an LSP or the {S|T}-PEs for a MS-PW. MEPs reside 
   in nodes A and D while MIPs reside in nodes B and C. The links 
   connecting adjacent nodes can be physical links, sub-layer LSPs or 
   lower layer TCMs. 

   This functional model defines the relationships between all OAM 
   entities from a maintenance perspective, to allow each Maintenance 
   Entity to monitor and manage the layer network under its 
   responsibility and to localize problems efficiently. 

   [Dave: given how these definitions are shaking out, should the MEG 
   and ME not be confined to a sub-layer, there is no such thing as a 
   completely self contained "layer" in the architecture to which a MEG 
   can apply, for Nov 3rd] 

   An MPLS-TP maintenance entity group can cover either the whole end-
   to-end or a Tandem Connection of the transport path. A Maintenance 
   Entity Group may be defined to monitor the transport path for fault 
   and/or performance management.  

   In case of associated bi-directional paths, two independent 
   Maintenance Entities are defined to independently monitor each 
   direction. This has implications for transactions that terminate at 
   or query a MIP as a return path from MIP to source MEP does not exist 
   in a unidirectional ME. 

   The following properties apply to all MPLS-TP MEs: 

   o They can be nested but not overlapped, e.g. an ME may cover a 
      segment or a concatenated segment of another ME, and may also 
      include the forwarding engine(s) of the node(s) at the edge(s) of 
      the segment or concatenated segment, but all its MEPs and MIPs are 
      no longer part of the encompassing ME. It is possible that MEPs of 
      nested MEs reside on a single node. 

   o Each OAM flow is associated with a single Maintenance Entity. 

   o OAM packets are subject to the same forwarding treatment (i.e. 
      fate share) as the data traffic and in some cases may be required 
      to have common queuing discipline E2E with the class of traffic 
      monitored. OAM packets can be distinguished from the data traffic 
      using the GAL and ACH constructs [9] for LSP and Section or the 
      ACH construct [6]and [9] for (MS-)PW.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework             October 2009 
    

   [Propose from Munich - rewrite to describe the MEG as collection of 
   one or more maint entities and then immediately define an ME. 

   [editors: much of this comment is actually either ME or MEP/MIP 
   specific, not MEG specific, hence we are struggling as to what to do 
   with this, for discussion Nov 3rd] 

   A key point in the definition of an ME is the end-points are defined 
   by location of the logical function MEP 

   Later in the framework we will discuss the precision with which we 
   can identify the location of a MEP/MIP i.e, ingress i/f, egress i/f 
   or node. 

   We need to distinguish between the point of interception of an OAM 
   msg and the point where the action takes place. 

   Somewhere we need to distinguish between the OAM control function and 
   the OAM measurement function. i.e. we set up a loop back (a control 
   function, in which case the OAM message may be intercepted and 
   actioned anywhere convenient), and the measurement function (i.e. 
   looping the packet to determine that it reached a particular part of 
   the network) which needs to be actioned at a precisely know and 
   stipulated point in the network/equipment. 

   Note that not all functionality / processing of an OAM pkt needs to 
   take place at the point of measurement. 

   We considered that an OAM function can be decomposed into the 
   following components  

   - Instruction or command 

   - Execution  

   - Addressing (node, interface etc) is ttl/LSP enough - do we need 
      sub-addressing to cause execution on a specific component in the 
      node - i.e. egress interface 

   - Response via OAM  

   - Reporting to mgt interface 

   It is useful to further decompose this into an initiator and a 
   responder in general an initiator is the source mep and the responder 
   is a mip or a sink mep. There are exceptions to this such as a mip 
   initiating an AIS msg or lock indication.]

   Another OAM construct is referred to as Maintenance Entity Group, 
   which is a collection of one or more MEs that belongs to the same 
   transport path and that are maintained and monitored as a group. 

   A use case for an MEG with more than one ME is point-to-multipoint 
   OAM. The reference model for the p2mp MEG is represented in Figure 2.

   In case of p2mp transport paths, the OAM operations are independent 
   for each ME (A-D, A-E and A-F): 

   o Fault conditions - depending from where the failure is located 

   o Packet loss - depending from where the packets are lost 

   o Packet delay - depending on different paths 

   Each leaf (i.e. D, E and F) terminates OAM messages to monitor its 
   own [Root, Leaf] ME while the root (i.e. A) generates OAM messages to 
   monitor all the MEs of the p2mp MEG. In this particular case, the 
   p2mp transport path is monitored by a MEG that consists of three MEs. 
   Nodes B and C might implement a MIP in the corresponding MEGs. 

3.2. MEG End Points (MEPs) 

   MEG End Points (MEPs) are the end points of an MEG. In the context of 
   an MPLS-TP LSP, only LERs can implement MEPs while in the context of 
   an LSP Tandem Connection both LERs and LSRs can implement MEPs. 
   Regarding MPLS-TP PW, only T-PEs can implement MEPs while for a PW 
   Tandem Connection both T-PEs and S-PEs can implement MEPs. In the 
   context of MPLS-TP Section, any MPLS-TP NE can implement MEPs.

   PW can be a tandem connection]

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework             October 2009 
    

   MEPs are responsible for activating and controlling all of the OAM 
   functionality for the MEG. A MEP is capable of initiating and 
   terminating OAM messages for fault management and performance 
   monitoring. These OAM messages are encapsulated into an OAM packet 
   using the G-ACh as defined in RFC 5586 [9]: in this case the G-ACh 
   message is an OAM message and the channel type indicates an OAM 
   message. A MEP terminates all the OAM packets it receives from the 
   MEG it belongs to. The MPLS label identifies the MEG the OAM packet 
   belongs to. 

   Once an MEG is configured, the operator can configure which OAM 
   functions to use on the MEG but the MEPs are always enabled. A node 
   at the edge of an MEG always support a MEP. 

   MEPs have to prevent OAM packets corresponding to a MEG from leaking 
   outside that MEG: 

   o A MEP sink terminates all the OAM packets that it receives 
      corresponding to its MEG and does not forward them further along 
      the path. 

   o A MEP in a tandem connection tunnels all the OAM packets that it 
      receives, upstream from the associated MEG to prevent them from 
      being processed within the associated MEG. The usage of the label 
      stacking mechanism allows all the MEPs and MIPs within the MEG to 
      distinguish tunneled OAM packets from OAM packets that belong to 
      that MEG.  

   MPLS-TP MEP passes a fault indication to its client (sub-)layer 
   network as a consequent action of fault detection. [ editor: 
   interesting case, is this always sink, or are we considering 
   loopbacks where inserting fault indication into the client (s)layer 
   is comparatively useless. We wrestled with same problem with RSVP 
   errors in the past ..., for Nov 3rd] 

   A MEP of an MPLS-TP transport path (Section, LSP or PW) coincides 
   with transport path termination and monitors it for failures or 
   performance degradation (e.g. based on packet counts) in an end-to-
   end scope. Note that both MEP source and MEP sink coincide with 
   transport paths' source and sink terminations. 

   A MEP of an MPLS-TP tandem connection is not necessarily coincident 
   with the termination of the MPLS-TP transport path (LSP or PW) and 
   monitors the transport path for failures or performance degradation 
   (e.g. based on packet counts) within the boundary of the MEG for the 
   tandem connection.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework             October 2009 
    

   It may occur in TCM that two MEPs are set on both sides of the 
   forwarding engine such that the MEG is entirely internal to the node. 

   Note that a MEP can only exist at the beginning and end of a sub-
   layer i.e. an LSP or PW. If we need to add a monitoring point within 
   an LSP we create a new sub-layer. We need to describe the migration 
   process for adding a TCM segment. 

   We have the case of a MIP sending msg to a MEP. To do this it uses 
   the LSP label - i.e. the top label of the stack at that point. 
   [editors: clarify in section 3.4] 

3.3. MEG Intermediate Points (MIPs) 

   A MEG Intermediate Point (MIP) is a point between the two MEPs of an 
   ME. 

   A MIP is capable of reacting to some OAM packets and forwarding all 
   the other OAM packets while ensuring fate sharing with data plane 
   packets. However, a MIP does not initiate [unsolicited OAM - editors: 
   this text was removed in the commented .rtf document from Munich but 
   not tracked as a revision, validate this change Nov 3rd] packets, but 
   may be addressed by OAM packets initiated by one of the MEPs of the 
   ME. A MIP can generate OAM packets only in response to OAM packets 
   that are sent on the MEG it belongs to. 

   An intermediate node within an MEG can either: 

   o not support MPLS-TP OAM (i.e. no MIPs per node) 

   o support per-node MIP (i.e. a single MIP per node) 

   o support per-interface MIP (i.e. two MIPs per node on both sides of 
      the forwarding engine) 

   A node at the edge of an MEG can also support a MEP and a per-
   interface MIP at the two sides of the forwarding engine. 

   When sending an OAM packet to a MIP, the source MEP should set the 
   TTL field to indicate the number of hops necessary to reach the node 
   where the MIP resides. It is always assumed that the "pipe" model of 
   TTL handling is used by the MPLS transport profile.  

   The source MEP should also include Target MIP information in the OAM 
   packets sent to a MIP to allow proper identification of the MIP 
   within the node. The MEG the OAM packet belongs to is inferred from 
   the MPLS label.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework             October 2009 
    

   Once an MEG is configured, the operator can enable/disable the MIPs 
   on the nodes within the MEG. 

3.4.  Server MEPs 

   A server MEP is a MEP of an ME that is either: 

   o defined in a layer network below the MPLS-TP layer network being 
      referenced, or 

   o defined in a sub-layer of the MPLS-TP layer network that is below 
      the sub-layer being referenced. 

   A server MEP can coincide with a MIP or a MEP in the client (MPLS-TP) 
   layer network. 

   A server MEP also interacts with the client/server adaptation 
   function between the client (MPLS-TP) layer network and the server 
   layer network. The adaptation function maintaints state on the 
   mapping of MPLS-TP transport paths that are setup over that server 
   layer's transport path.  

   For example, a server MEP can be either: 

   o A termination point of a physical link (e.g. 802.3), an SDH VC or 
      OTH ODU for the MPLS-TP Section layer network, defined in section 
      4.1; 

   o An MPLS-TP Section MEP for MPLS-TP LSPs, defined in section 4.2; 

   o An MPLS-TP LSP MEP for MPLS-TP PWs, defined in section 4.4; 

   o An MPLS-TP LSP Tandem Connection MEP for higher-level LTCMEs, 
      defined in section 4.3; 

   o An MPLS-TP PW Tandem Connection MEP for higher-level PTCMEs, 
      defined in section 4.5. 

   The server MEP can run appropriate OAM functions for fault detection 
   within the server (sub-)layer network, and notifies a fault 
   indication to its client MPLS-TP layer network. Server MEP OAM 
   functions are outside the scope of this document. 

3.5. Tandem Connection 

   A tandem connection is instantiated to support tandem connection 
   monitoring (TCM).

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework             October 2009 
    

   TCM for a given portion of a transport path is implemented by first 
   creating a hierarchical LSP that that has a 1:1 association with 
   portion of the transport path that is to be uniquely monitored such 
   that there is direct correlation between all FM and PM information 
   gathered for the tandem connection AND the monitored portion of the 
   E2E path. The tandem connection is monitored using normal LSP 
   monitoring. There are a number of implications to this approach: 

   1) The hierarchical LSP would use the uniform model of EXP code 
      point copying between sub-layers for diffserv such that the E2E 
      markings and PHB treatment was preserved in the tandem 
      connection. 

   2) The hierarchical LSP would use the pipe model for TTL handling 
      such that MIP addressing for the E2E entity would be distinct 
      from the tandem connection.  

   3) PM statistics need to be adjusted for the overhead of the 
      additional sub-layer.  

   4) The server sub-layer LSP is viewed as single hop by the client 
      LSP. The E2E ME source MEPs cannot direct transactions to tandem 
      connection MIPs.  

   [editors: the text from Munich suggested that a tandem connection 
   could be N:1, we've stuck with 1:1 such that there would be direct 
   correlation of PM stats between the tandem connection and the 
   monitored portion of the transport path, a N:1 hierarchical LSP IF WE 
   INSIST on including, should be documented as a separate procedure] 

4. Reference Model 

   The reference model for the MPLS-TP framework builds upon the concept 
   of an MEG, and its associated MEPs and MIPs, to support the 
   functional requirements specified in [12].  

   The following MPLS-TP MEs are specified in this document: 

   o A Section Maintenance Entity (SME), allowing monitoring and 
      management of MPLS-TP Sections (between MPLS LSRs). 

   o A LSP Maintenance Entity (LME), allowing monitoring and management 
      of an end-to-end LSP (between LERs). 

   o A PW Maintenance Entity (PME), allowing monitoring and management 
      of an end-to-end SS/MS-PWs (between T-PEs).

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework             October 2009 
    

   o An LSP Tandem Connection Maintenance Entity (LTCME), allowing 
      monitoring and management of an LSP Tandem Connection between any 
      LER/LSR along the LSP. [Munich: Please clarify that an LTCME is 
      JUST an ordinary hierarchical LSP (RFC3031). 

     Note - TCM only makes sense for LSPs as previously noted.]The MEs 
   specified  in  this  MPLS-TP  framework  are  compliant  with  the 
   architecture framework for MPLS MS-PWs [7] and MPLS LSPs [2]. 

   Hierarchical LSPs are also supported. In this case, each LSP Tunnel 
   in the hierarchy is a different sub-layer network that can be 
   monitored independently from higher and lower level LSP tunnels in 
   the hierarchy, end-to-end (from LER to LER) by an LME. Tandem 
   Connection monitoring via LTCME are applicable on each LSP Tunnel in 
   the hierarchy. 

   [Munich: There was discussion on above para - and it was suggested 
   that it be removed.] [ for discussion Nov 3rd, TCM and hierarchical 
   LSPs...]

   framework. The figure depicts portions of two MPLS-TP enabled network 
   domains, Domain 1 and Domain Z. In Domain 1, LSR1 is adjacent to LSR2 
   via the MPLS Section Sec12 and LSR2 is adjacent to LSR3 via the MPLS 
   Section Sec23. Similarly, in Domain Z, LSRX is adjacent to LSRY via 
   the MPLS Section SecXY and LSRY is adjacent to LSRZ via the MPLS 
   Section SecYZ. In addition, LSR3 is adjacent to LSRX via the MPLS 
   Section 3X. 

   Figure 3 also shows a bi-directional MS-PW (PW1Z) between AC1 on TPE1

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework             October 2009 
    

   The MPLS-TP OAM procedures that apply to an MEG of a given transport 
   path are expected to operate independently from procedures on other 
   MEGs of the same transport path and certainly MEGs of other transport 
   paths. Yet, this does not preclude that multiple MEGs may be affected 
   simultaneously by the same network condition, for example, a fibre 
   cut event.  

   Note that there are no constrains imposed by this OAM framework on 
   the number, or type (p2p, p2mp, LSP or PW), of MEGs that may be 
   instantiated on a particular node. In particular, when looking at 
   Figure 3, it should be possible to configure one or more MEPs on the 
   same node if that node is the endpoint of one or more MEGs. 

   Figure 3 does not describe a PW3X PTCME because typically TCMs are 
   used to monitor an OAM domain (like PW13 and PWXZ PTCMEs)   rather 
   than the segment between two OAM domains. However the OAM framework 
   does not pose any constraints on the way TCM are instantiated as long 
   as they are not overlapping. 

   The subsections below define the MEs specified in this MPLS-TP OAM 
   architecture  framework  document.  Unless  otherwise  stated,  all 
   references to domains, LSRs, MPLS Sections, LSPs, pseudowires and MEs 
   in this section are made in relation to those shown in Figure 3.  

4.1. MPLS-TP Section Monitoring 

   An MPLS-TP Section ME (SME) is an MPLS-TP maintenance entity intended 
   to an MPLS Section as defined in [11]. An SME may be configured on 
   any MPLS section. SME OAM packets must fate share with the user data 
   packets sent over the monitored MPLS Section. 

   An SME is intended to be deployed for applications where it is 
   preferable to monitor the link between topologically adjacent (next 
   hop in this layer network) MPLS (and MPLS-TP enabled) LSRs rather 
   than monitoring the individual LSP or PW segments traversing the MPLS 
   Section and the server layer technology does not provide adequate OAM

4.2. MPLS-TP LSP End-to-End Monitoring 

   An MPLS-TP LSP ME (LME) is an MPLS-TP maintenance entity intended to 
   monitor an end-to-end LSP between two LERs. An LME may be configured 
   on any MPLS LSP. LME OAM packets must fate share with user data 
   packets sent over the monitored MPLS-TP LSP. 

   An LME is intended to be deployed in scenarios where it is desirable 
   to monitor an entire LSP between its LERs, rather than, say, 
   monitoring individual PWs.

   1) the PSN13 LME between LER 1 and LER 3, and 2) the PSNXZ LME 
   between LER X and LER Y. Note that the presence of a PSN3X LME in 
   such a configuration is optional, hence, not precluded by this 
   framework. For instance, the SPs may prefer to monitor the MPLS-TP 
   Section between the two LSRs rather than the individual LSPs.  

4.3. MPLS-TP LSP Tandem Connection Monitoring 

   An MPLS-TP LSP Tandem Connection Monitoring ME (LTCME) is an MPLS-TP 
   maintenance entity intended to monitor an arbitrary part of an LSP 
   between a given pair of LSRs independently from the end-to-end 
   monitoring (LME). An LTCME can monitor an LSP segment or concatenated 
   segment and it may also include the forwarding engine(s) of the 
   node(s) at the edge(s) of the segment or concatenated segment. 

   Multiple LTCMEs MAY be configured on any LSP. The LSRs that terminate 
   the LTCME may or may not be immediately adjacent at the MPLS-TP 
   layer. LTCME OAM packets must fate share with the user data packets 
   sent over the monitored LSP segment. 

   A LTCME can be defined between the following entities: 

        o LER and any LSR of a given LSP. 

        o Any two LSRs of a given LSP.  

   An LTCME is intended to be deployed in scenarios where it is 
   preferable to monitor the behaviour of a part of an LSP rather than 
   the entire LSP itself, for example when there is a need to monitor a

   part of an LSP that extends beyond the administrative boundaries of 
   an MPLS-TP enabled administrative domain. 

   Note that LTCMEs are equally applicable to hierarchical LSPs.

        Figure 6 MPLS-TP LSP Tandem Connection Monitoring ME (LTCME) 

   Figure 6 depicts a variation of the reference model in Figure 3 where 
   there is an end-to-end PSN LSP (PSN1Z LSP) between PE1 and PEZ. PSN1Z 
   LSP consists of, at least, three LSP Concatenated Segments: PSN13, 
   PSN3X and PSNXZ. In this scenario there are two separate LTCMEs 
   configured to monitor the PSN1Z LSP: 1) a LTCME monitoring the PSN13 
   LSP Concatenated Segment on Domain 1 (PSN13 LTCME), and 2) a LTCME 
   monitoring the PSNXZ LSP Concatenated Segment on Domain Z (PSNXZ 
   LTCME). 

   It is worth noticing that LTCMEs can coexist with the LME monitoring 
   the end-to-end LSP and that LTCME MEPs and LME MEPs can be coincident 
   in the same node (e.g. PE1 node supports both the PSN1Z LME MEP and 
   the PSN13 LTCME MEP).

4.4. MPLS-TP PW Monitoring 

   An MPLS-TP PW ME (PME) is an MPLS-TP maintenance entity intended to 
   monitor a SS-PW or MS-PW between a pair of T-PEs. A PME MAY be 
   configured on any SS-PW or MS-PW. PME OAM packets must fate share 
   with the user data packets sent over the monitored PW. 

   A PME is intended to be deployed in scenarios where it is desirable 
   to monitor an entire PW between a pair of MPLS-TP enabled T-PEs 
   rather than monitoring the LSP aggregating multiple PWs between PEs.

   PW13, PW3X and PWXZ and its associated end-to-end PME (PW1Z PME). 

4.5. MPLS-TP MS-PW Tandem Connection Monitoring 

   An MPLS-TP MS-PW Tandem Connection Monitoring ME (PTCME) is an MPLS-
   TP maintenance entity intended to monitor an arbitrary part of an MS-
   PW between a given pair of PEs independently from the end-to-end 
   monitoring (PME). A PTCME can monitor a PW segment or concatenated 
   segment and it may also include the forwarding engine(s) of the 
   node(s) at the edge(s) of the segment or concatenated segment. 

   Multiple PTCMEs MAY be configured on any MS-PW. The PEs may or may 
   not be immediately adjacent at the MS-PW layer. PTCME OAM packets 
   fate share with the user data packets sent over the monitored PW 
   Segment. 

   A PTCME can be defined between the following entities: 

   o T-PE and any S-PE of a given MS-PW

   o Any two S-PEs of a given MS-PW. It can span several PW segments.  

   A PTCME is intended to be deployed in scenarios where it is 
   preferable to monitor the behaviour of a part of a MS-PW rather than 
   the entire end-to-end PW itself, for example to monitor an MS-PW 
   Segment within a given network domain of an inter-domain MS-PW.

   Figure 8 depicts the same MS-PW (MS-PW1Z) between AC1 and AC2 as in

   to monitor MS-PW1Z: 1) a PTCME monitoring the PW13 MS-PW Segment on 
   Domain 1 (PW13 PTCME), and 2) a PTCME monitoring the PWXZ MS-PW 
   Segment on Domain Z with (PWXZ PTCME). 

   It is worth noticing that PTCMEs can coexist with the PME monitoring 
   the end-to-end MS-PW and that PTCME MEPs and PME MEPs can be 
   coincident in the same node (e.g. TPE1 node supports both the PW1Z 
   PME MEP and the PW13 PTCME MEP). 

5. OAM Functions for proactive monitoring 

   [Munich: Note the fwk needs to be explicit about the mapping of 
   functions to the tools we have chosen.] [editors: shouldn't it be the 
   other way around?] 

   In this document, proactive monitoring refers to OAM operations that 
   are either configured to be carried out periodically and continuously 
   or preconfigured to act on certain events such as alarm signals.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework             October 2009 
    

5.1. Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification 

   Proactive Continuity Check functions are used to detect a loss of 
   continuity defect (LOC) between two MEPs in an MEG. 

   Proactive Connectivity Verification functions are used to detect an 
   unexpected connectivity defect between two MEGs (e.g. mismerging or 
   misconnection), as well as unexpected connectivity within the MEG 
   with an unexpected MEP. 

   Both functions are based on the (proactive) generation of OAM packets 
   by the source MEP that are processed by the sink MEP. As a 
   consequence these two functions are grouped together into Continuity 
   Check and Connectivity Verification (CC-V) OAM packets. 

   In order to perform pro-active Connectivity Verification function, 
   each CC-V OAM packet MUST also include a globally unique Source MEP 
   identifier. When used to perform only pro-active Continuity Check 
   function, the CC-V OAM packet MAY not include any MEG identifier. 

   Different formats of MEP identifiers are defined in [10] to address 
   different applications. When MPLS-TP is deployed in transport network 
   applications as defined by ITU-T, the ICC-based format for MEP 
   identification is the DEFAULT and MANDATORY identification scheme. 
   When MPLS-TP is deployed in IP-based environment, the IP-based MEP 
   identification is the DEFAULT and MANDATORY identification scheme. 

   As a consequence, it is not possible to detect misconnections between 
   two MEGs monitored only for Continuity while it is possible to detect 
   any misconnection between two MEGs monitored for Continuity and 
   Connectivity or between an MEG monitored for Continuity and 
   Connectivity and one MEG monitored only for Continuity. 

   CC-V OAM packets MUST be transmitted at a regular, operator's 
   configurable, rate. The default CC-V transmission periods are 
   application dependent (see section 5.1.4). 

   Proactive CC-V OAM packets are transmitted with the "minimum loss 
   probability PHB" within a single network operator. This PHB is 
   configurable on network operator's basis. PHBs can be translated at 
   the network borders. 

   [Editor's note - Describe the relation between the previous paragraph 
   and the fate sharing requirement. Need to clarify also in the 
   requirement document that for proactive CC-V the fate sharing is 
   related to the forwarding behavior and not to the QoS behavior]

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework             October 2009 
    

   In a bidirectional point-to-point transport path, when a MEP is 
   enabled to generate pro-active CC-V OAM packets with a configured 
   transmission rate, it also expects to receive pro-active CC-V OAM 
   packets from its peer MEP at the same transmission rate. In a 
   unidirectional transport path (either point-to-point or point-to-
   multipoint), only the source MEP is enabled to generate CC-V OAM 
   packets and only the sink MEP is configured to expect these packets 
   at the configured rate. 

   MIPs, as well as intermediate nodes not supporting MPLS-TP OAM, are 
   transparent to the pro-active CC-V information and forward these pro-
   active CC-V OAM packets as regular data packets. 

   To initialize the proactive CC-V monitoring on a configured ME 
   without affecting traffic, the MEP source function (generating pro-
   active CC-V packets) should be enabled prior to the corresponding MEP 
   sink function (detecting continuity and connectivity defects).  When 
   disabling the CC-V proactive functionality, the MEP sink function 
   should be disabled prior to the corresponding MEP source function. 

5.1.1. Defects identified by CC-V 

   Pro-active CC-V functions allow a sink MEP to detect the defect 
   conditions described in the following sub-sections. For all of the 
   described defect cases, the sink MEP SHOULD notify the equipment 
   fault management process of the detected defect. 

5.1.1.1. Loss Of Continuity defect  

   When proactive CC-V is enabled, a sink MEP detects a loss of 
   continuity (LOC) defect when it fails to receive pro-active CC-V OAM 
   packets from the peer MEP. 

   o Entry criteria:  if no pro-active CC-V OAM packets from the peer 
      MEP (i.e. with the correct ME and peer MEP identifiers) are

   peer source MEP when the received packet carries an incorrect ME 
   identifier. 

   o Entry criteria: the sink MEP receives a pro-active CC-V OAM packet 
      with an incorrect ME ID. 

   o Exit criteria: the sink MEP does not receive any pro-active CC-V 
      OAM packet with an incorrect ME ID for an interval equal at least 
      to 3.5 times the longest transmission period of the pro-active 
      CC-V OAM packets received with an incorrect ME ID since this 
      defect has been raised. This requires the OAM message to self 
      identify the CC-V periodicity as not all MEPs can be expected to 
      have knowledge of all MEs. 

5.1.1.3. MEP misconfiguration defect 

   When a pro-active CC-V packet is received, a sink MEP identifies a 
   MEP misconfiguration defect with its peer source MEP when the 
   received packet carries a correct ME Identifier but an unexpected 
   peer MEP Identifier which includes the MEP's own MEP Identifier. 

   o Entry criteria: the sink MEP receives a CC-V pro-active packet 
      with correct ME ID but with unexpected MEP ID.  

   o Exit criteria: the sink MEP does not receive any pro-active CC-V 
      OAM packet with a correct ME ID and unexpected MEP ID for an 
      interval equal at least to 3.5 times the longest transmission 
      period of the pro-active CC-V OAM packets received with a correct 
      ME ID and unexpected MEP ID since this defect has been raised. 

5.1.1.4. Period Misconfiguration defect  

   If pro-active CC-V OAM packets are received with correct ME and MEP 
   identifiers but with a transmission period different than its own 
   configured transmission period, then a CC-V period mis-configuration 
   defect is detected 

   o Entry criteria: a MEP receives a CC-V pro-active packet with 
      correct ME ID and MEP ID but with a Period field value different 
      than its own CC-V configured transmission period.  

   o Exit criteria: the sink MEP does not receive any pro-active CC-V 
      OAM packet with a correct ME and MEP IDs and an incorrect 
      transmission period for an interval equal at least to 3.5 times 
      the longest transmission period of the pro-active CC-V OAM packets 
      received with a correct ME and MEP IDs and an incorrect 
      transmission period since this defect has been raised.

5.1.2. Consequent action 

   [editors: IMO this would be better folded into the specific defect 
   types, If agreed I will edit accordingly] 

   A sink MEP that detects one of the defect conditions defined in 
   section 5.1.1 MUST perform the following consequent actions. Some of 
   these consequent actions SHOULD be enabled/disabled by the operator 
   depending upon the application used (see section 5.1.4). 

   If a MEP detects an unexpected ME Identifier, or an unexpected MEP, 
   it MUST block all the traffic (including also the user data packets) 
   that it receives from the misconnected transport path. 

   If a MEP detects LOC defect and the CC-V monitoring is enabled it 
   SHOULD block all the traffic (including also the user data packets) 
   that it receives from the transport path if this consequent action 
   has been enabled by the operator. 

   It is worth noticing that the OAM requirements document [12] 
   recommends that CC-V proactive monitoring is enabled on every ME in 
   order to reliably detect connectivity defects. However, CC-V 
   proactive monitoring MAY be disabled by an operator on an ME. In the 
   event of a misconnection between a transport path that is pro-
   actively monitored for CC-V and a transport path which is not, the 
   MEP of the former transport path will detect a LOC defect 
   representing a connectivity problem (e.g. a misconnection with a 
   transport path where CC-V proactive monitoring is not enabled) 
   instead of a continuity problem, with a consequent wrong traffic 
   delivering. For these reasons, the traffic block consequent action is 
   applied even when a LOC condition occurs. This block consequent 
   action MAY be disabled through configuration. This deactivation of 
   the block action may be used for activating or deactivating the 
   monitoring when it is not possible to synchronize the function 
   activation of the two peer MEPs. 

   If a MEP detects a LOC defect, an unexpected ME Identifier, or an 
   unexpected MEP it MUST declare a signal fail condition at the 
   transport path level. 

   If a MEP detects an Unexpected Period defect it SHOULD declare a 
   signal fail condition at the transport path level. 

   [Editor's note - Transport equipment also performs defect correlation 
   (as defined in G.806) in order to properly report failures to the 
   transport NMS ]. The current working assumption, to be further

   investigated, is that defect correlations are outside the scope of 
   this document and to be defined in ITU-T documents.] 

5.1.3. Configuration considerations 

   At all MEPs inside a MEG, the following configuration information 
   needs to be configured when a proactive CC-V function is enabled: 

   o MEG ID; the MEG identifier to which the MEP belongs; 

   o MEP-ID; the MEP's own identity inside the MEG; 

   o list of peer MEPs inside the MEG. For a point-to-point MEG the 
      list would consist of the single peer MEP ID from which the OAM 
      packets are expected. In case of the root MEP of a p2mp MEG, the 
      list is composed by all the leaf MEP IDs inside the ME. In case of 
      the leaf MEP of a p2mp MEG, the list is composed by the root MEP 
      ID (i.e. each leaf MUST know the root MEP ID from which it expect 
      to receive the CC-V OAM packets). 

   o transmission rate; the default CC-V transmission periods are 
      application dependent (see section 5.1.4) 

   o PHB; it identifies the per-hop behaviour of CC-V packet. Proactive 
      CC-V packets are transmitted with the "minimum loss probability 
      PHB" previously configured within a single network operator. This 
      PHB is configurable on network operator's basis. PHBs can be 
      translated at the network borders.  

   For statically provisioned transport paths the above information are 
   statically configured; for dynamically established transport paths 
   the configuration information are signaled via the control plane. 

5.1.4. Applications for proactive CC-V  

   CC-V is applicable for fault management, performance monitoring, or 
   protection switching applications. 

   o Fault Management: default transmission period is 1s (i.e. 
      transmission rate of 1 packet/second) 

   o Performance Monitoring: Performance monitoring is only relevant 
      when the transport path is defect free. CC-V contributes to the 
      accuracy of PM statistics by permitting the defect free periods to 
      be properly distinguished.   


 
 
Busi et al.            Expires April 26, 2010                [Page 29] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework             October 2009 
    

   o Protection Switching: in order to achieve sub-50ms the defect 
      entry criteria should resolve in less than 50msec, and should 
      budget sufficient portion of the 50 msec. to be available for 
      consequent action processing. In some cases, when a slower 
      recovery time is acceptable, it is also possible to lengthen the 
      transmission rate.  

   It SHOULD be possible for the operator to configure these 
   transmission rates for all applications, to satisfy his internal 
   requirements. 

   In addition, the operator should be able to define the consequent 
   action to be performed for each of these applications. 

5.2. Remote Defect Indication 

   The Remote Defect Indication (RDI) is an indicator that is 
   transmitted by a MEP to communicate to its peer MEPs that a signal 
   fail condition exists.  RDI is only used for bidirectional 
   connections and is associated with proactive CC-V activation. The RDI 
   indicator is piggy-backed onto the CC-V packet. 

   When a MEP detects a signal fail condition (e.g. in case of a 
   continuity or connectivity defect), it should begin transmitting an 
   RDI indicator to its peer MEP.  The RDI information will be included 
   in all pro-active CC-V packets that it generates for the duration of 
   the signal fail condition's existence. 

   [Editor's note - Add some forward compatibility information to cover 
   the case where future OAM mechanisms that contributes to the signal 
   fail detection (and RDI generation) are defined.] 

   A MEP that receives the packets with the RDI information should 
   determine that its peer MEP has encountered a defect condition 
   associated with a signal fail. 

   MIPs as well as intermediate nodes not supporting MPLS-TP OAM are 
   transparent to the RDI indicator and forward these proactive CC-V 
   packets that include the RDI indicator as regular data packets, i.e. 
   the MIP should not perform any actions nor examine the indicator. 

   When the signal fail defect condition clears, the MEP should clear 
   the RDI indicator from subsequent transmission of pro-active CC-V 
   packets.  A MEP should clear the RDI defect upon reception of a pro-
   active CC-V packet from the source MEP with the RDI indicator 
   cleared.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework             October 2009 
    

5.2.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support RDI indication, this may be a unique OAM message 
   or an OAM information element embedded in a CV message. In this case 
   the RDI transmission rate and PHB of the OAM packets carrying RDI 
   should be the same as that configured for  CC-V. 

5.2.2. Applications for Remote Defect Indication 

   RDI is applicable for the following applications: 

   o Single-ended fault management - A MEP that receives an RDI 
      indication from its peer MEP, can report a far-end defect 
      condition (i.e. the peer MEP has detected a signal fail condition 
      in the traffic direction from the MEP that receives the RDI 
      indication to the peer MEP that has sent the RDI information).  

   o Contribution to far-end performance monitoring - The indication of 
      the far-end defect condition is used as a contribution to the 
      bidirectional performance monitoring process. 

5.3. Alarm Reporting 

   The Alarm Reporting function relies upon an Alarm Indication Signal 
   (AIS) message used to suppress alarms following detection of defect 
   conditions at the server (sub-)layer. 

   o A server MEP that detects a signal fail conditions in the server 
      (sub-)layer, can generate packets with AIS information in a 
      direction opposite to its peers MEPs to allow the suppression of 
      secondary alarms at the MEP in the client (sub-)layer.  

   A server MEP is responsible for notifying the MPLS-TP layer network 
   MEP upon fault detection in the server layer network to which the 
   server MEP is associated. 

   [editor: the above is confused. The server layer passes signal fail 
   or whatever notification to the adaptation function which has 
   knowledge of the client layer transport paths, otherwise we are 
   discussing a layer violation. These may be MEP co-located end points 
   or MIPs. It is the OAM functionality co-located with the adaptation 
   function that performs AIS insertion into the client layer MPLS-TP 
   paths.... If agreed I will re-word accordingly] 

   Only Server MEPs can issue MPLS-TP packets with AIS information. Upon 
   detection of a signal fail condition the Server MEP can immediately 
   start transmitting periodic packets with AIS information. These 
 
 
Busi et al.            Expires April 26, 2010                [Page 31] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework             October 2009 
    

   periodic packets, with AIS information, continue to be transmitted 
   until the signal fail condition is cleared.  [editor: SEE ABOVE] 

   Upon receiving a packet with AIS information an MPLS-TP MEP detects 
   an AIS defect condition and suppresses loss of continuity alarms 
   associated with all of its peer MEPs. [editor: There can only be one 
   MEP for the ME AIS has been received in association with] A MEP 
   resumes loss of continuity alarm generation upon detecting loss of 
   continuity defect conditions in the absence of AIS condition. 

   For example, let's consider a fiber cut between LSR 1 and LSR 2 in 
   the reference network of Figure 3. Assuming that all the MEs 
   described in Figure 3 have pro-active CC-V enabled, a LOC defect is 
   detected by the MEPs of Sec12 SME, PSN13 LME, PW1 PTCME and PW1Z PME, 
   however in transport network only the alarm associate to the fiber 
   cut needs to be reported to NMS while all these secondary alarms 
   should be suppressed (i.e. not reported to the NMS or reported as 
   secondary alarms). 

   If the fiber cut is detected by the MEP in the physical layer (in 
   LSR2), LSR2 can generate the proper alarm in the physical layer and 
   suppress the secondary alarm associated with the LOC defect detected 
   on Sec12 SME. As both MEPs reside within the same node, this process 
   does not involve any external protocol exchange. Otherwise, if the 
   physical layer has not enough OAM capabilities to detect the fiber 
   cut, the MEP of Sec12 SME in LSR2 will report a LOC alarm. 

   In both cases, the MEP of Sec12 SME in LSR 2 generates AIS packets on 
   the PSN13 LME in order to allow its MEP in LSR3 to suppress the LOC 
   alarm. LSR3 can also suppress the secondary alarm on PW1 PTCME 
   because the MEP of PW1 PTCME resides within the same node as the MEP 
   of PSN13 LME. The MEP of PW1 PTCME in LSR3 also generates AIS packets 
   on PW1Z PME in order to allow its MEP in LSRZ to suppress the LOC 
   alarm. 

   The generation of AIS packets for each ME in the client (sub-)layer 
   is configurable (i.e. the operator can enable/disable the AIS 
   generation). 

   AIS packets are transmitted with the "minimum loss probability PHB" 
   within a single network operator. This PHB is configurable on network 
   operator's basis. 

   A MIP is transparent to packets with AIS information and therefore 
   does not require any information to support AIS functionality.

5.4. Lock Reporting 

   To be incorporated in a future revision of this document 

5.5. Packet Loss Monitoring 

   Packet Loss Monitoring (LM) is one of the capabilities supported by 
   the MPLS-TP Performance Monitoring (PM) function in order to 
   facilitate reporting of QoS information for a transport path. LM is 
   used to exchange counter values for the number of ingress and egress 
   packets transmitted and received by the transport path monitored by a 
   pair of MEPs.   

   Proactive LM is performed by periodically sending LM OAM packets from 
   a MEP to a peer MEP and by receiving LM OAM packets from the peer MEP 
   (if a bidirectional transport path) during the life time of the 
   transport path. Each MEP performs measurements of its transmitted and 
   received packets. These measurements are then transactionally 
   correlated with the peer MEP in the ME to derive the impact of packet 
   loss on a number of performance metrics for the ME in the MEG. The LM 
   transactions are issued such that the OAM packets will experience the 
   same queuing discipline as the measured traffic while transiting 
   between the MEPs in the ME. 

   For a MEP, near-end packet loss refers to packet loss associated with 
   incoming data packets (from the far-end MEP) while far-end packet 
   loss refers to packet loss associated with egress data packets 
   (towards the far-end MEP).  

5.5.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support proactive LM, the transmission rate and PHB 
   associated with the LM OAM packets originating from a MEP need be 
   configured as part of the LM provisioning procedures. LM OAM packets 
   should be transmitted with the PHB that yields the lowest packet loss 
   performance among the PHB Scheduling Classes or Ordered Aggregates 
   (see RFC 3260 [15]) in the monitored transport path for the relevant 
   network domain(s).  

5.5.2. Applications for Packet Loss Monitoring 

   LM is relevant for the following applications: 

   o Single or double-end performance monitoring: determination of the 
      packet loss performance of a transport path for Service Level 
      Agreement (SLA) verification purposes.

   o Single or double-end performance monitoring: determination of the 
      packet loss performance of a PHB Scheduling Class or Ordered 
      Aggregate within a transport path. 

   o Contribution to service unable time. Both near-end and far-end 
      packet loss measurements contribute to performance metrics such as 
      near-end severely errored seconds (Near-End SES) and far-end 
      severely errored seconds (Far-End SES) respectively, which 
      together contribute to unavailable time, in a manner similar to 
      Recommendation G.826 [19] and Recommendation G.7710 [20].  

5.6. Client Signal Failure Indication 

   The Client Signal Failure Indication (CSF) function is used to help 
   process client defects and propagate a client signal defect condition 
   from the process associated with the local attachment circuit where 
   the defect was detected (typically the source adaptation function for 
   the local client interface) to the process associated with the far-
   end attachment circuit (typically the source adaptation function for 
   the far-end client interface) for the same transmission path in case 
   the client of the transmission path does not support a native 
   defect/alarm indication mechanism, e.g. FDI/AIS. 

   A source MEP starts transmitting a CSF indication to its peer MEP 
   when it receives a local client signal defect notification via its 
   local CSF function. Mechanisms to detect local client signal fail 
   defects are technology specific. 

   A sink MEP that has received a CSF indication report this condition 
   to its associated client process via its local CSF function. 
   Consequent actions toward the client attachment circuit are 
   technology specific. 

   Either there needs to be a 1:1 correspondence between the client and 
   the ME, or when multiple clients are multiplexed over a transport 
   path, the CSF message requires additional information to permit the 
   client instance to be identified. 

5.6.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support CSF indication, the CSF transmission rate and PHB 
   of the CSF OAM message/information element should be configured as 
   part of the CSF configuration.  

5.6.2. Applications for Client Signal Failure Indication 

   CSF is applicable for the following applications:

   o Single-ended fault management - A MEP that receives a CSF 
      indication from its peer MEP, can report a far-end client defect 
      condition (i.e. the peer MEP has been informed of local client 
      signal fail condition in the traffic direction from the client to 
      the peer MEP that transmitted the CSF).  

   o Contribution to far-end performance monitoring - The indication of 
      the far-end defect condition may be used to account on network 
      operator contribution to the bidirectional performance monitoring 
      process.  

   CSF supports the application described in Appendix VIII of ITU-T 
   G.806 [18]. 

5.7. Delay Measurement 

   Delay Measurement (DM) is one of the capabilities supported by the 
   MPLS-TP PM function in order to facilitate reporting of QoS 
   information for a transport path. Specifically, pro-active DM is used 
   to measure the long-term packet delay and packet delay variation in 
   the transport path monitored by a pair of MEPs.   

   Proactive DM is performed by sending periodic DM OAM packets from a 
   MEP to a peer MEP and by receiving DM OAM packets from the peer MEP 
   (if a bidirectional transport path) during a configurable time 
   interval.  

   Pro-active DM can be operated in two ways: 

   o One-way: a MEP sends DM OAM packet to its peer MEP containing all 
      the required information to facilitate one-way packet delay and/or 
      one-way packet delay variation measurements at the peer MEP. Note 
      that this requires synchronized precision time at either MEP by 
      means outside the scope of this framework. 

   o Two-way: a MEP sends DM OAM packet with a DM request to its peer 
      MEP, which replies with a DM OAM packet as a DM response. The 
      request/response DM OAM packets containing all the required 
      information to facilitate two-way packet delay and/or two-way 
      packet delay variation measurements from the viewpoint of the 
      source MEP. 

5.7.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support pro-active DM, the transmission rate and PHB 
   associated with the DM OAM packets originating from a MEP need be 
   configured as part of the DM provisioning procedures. DM OAM packets

   should be transmitted with the PHB that yields the lowest packet loss 
   performance among the PHB Scheduling Classes or Ordered Aggregates 
   (see RFC 3260 [15]) in the monitored transport path for the relevant 
   network domain(s).  

5.7.2. Applications for Delay Measurement 

   DM is relevant for the following applications: 

   o Single or double-end performance monitoring: determination of the 
      delay performance of a transport path for SLA verification 
      purposes. 

   o Single or double-end performance monitoring: determination of the 
      delay performance of a PHB Scheduling Class or Ordered Aggregate 
      within a transport path 

6. OAM Functions for on-demand monitoring 

[Munich: Note the fwk needs to be explicit about the mapping of 
functions to the tools we have chosen.] 

   In contrast to proactive monitoring, on-demand monitoring is 
   initiated manually and for a limited amount of time, usually for 
   operations such as e.g. diagnostics to investigate into a defect 
   condition. 

   [editor: we would have to babysit a lot fewer words if we folded this 
   into section 5 and simply indicated which transactions existed in 
   both proactive and reactive forms... if agreed I will edit accordingly] 

6.1. Connectivity Verification 

   In order to preserve network resources, e.g. bandwidth, processing 
   time at switches, it may be preferable to not use proactive CC-V. In 
   order to perform fault management functions, network management may 
   invoke periodic on-demand bursts of on-demand CV packets. 

   Use of on-demand CV is dependent on the existence of a bi-directional 
   connection ME, because it requires the presence of a return path in 
   the data plane. 

   [Editor's note - Clarify in the sentence above and within the 
   paragraph that on-demand CV requires a return path to send back the 
   reply to on-demand CV packets] 


 
 
Busi et al.            Expires April 26, 2010                [Page 36] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework             October 2009 
    

   An additional use of on-demand CV would be to detect and locate a 
   problem of connectivity when a problem is suspected or known based on 
   other tools.  In this case the functionality will be triggered by the 
   network management in response to a status signal or alarm 
   indication. 

   On-demand CV is based upon generation of on-demand CV packets that 
   should uniquely identify the ME that is being checked.  The on-demand 
   functionality may be used to check either an entire ME (end-to-end) 
   or between a MEP to a specific MIP. This functionality may not be 
   available for associated bidirectional paths as the MIP may not have  
   a return path to the source MEP for the on-demand CV transaction. 

   On-demand CV may generate a one-time burst of on-demand CV packets, 
   or be used to invoke periodic, non-continuous, bursts of on-demand CV 
   packets.  The number of packets generated in each burst is 
   configurable at the MEPs, and should take into account normal packet-
   loss conditions.  

   When invoking a periodic check of the ME, the source MEP should issue 
   a burst of on-demand CV packets that uniquely identifies the ME being 
   verified.  The number of packets and their transmission rate should 
   be pre-configured and known to both the source MEP and the target MEP 
   or MIP.  The source MEP should use the TTL field to indicate the 
   number of hops necessary, when targeting a MIP and use the default 
   value when performing an end-to-end check [IB => This is quite 
   generic for addressing packets to MIPs and MEPs so it is better to 
   move this text in section 2].  The target MEP/MIP shall return a 
   reply on-demand CV packet for each packet received.  If the expected 
   number of on-demand CV reply packets is not received at source MEP, 
   the LOC defect state is entered. 

   [Editor's note - We need to add some text for the usage of on-demand 
   CV with different packet sizes, e.g. to discover MTU problems.] 

   When a connectivity problem is detected (e.g. via a proactive CC-V 
   OAM tool), an on-demand CV tool can be used to check the path.  The 
   series should check CV from MEP to peer MEP on the path, and if a 
   fault is discovered, by lack of response, then additional checks may 
   be performed to each of the intermediate MIP to locate the fault. 

   [Dave: this seems a bit warped as the original discussion was about 
   not spending resources on proactive CC-V, so can we just be honest 
   about "when the incredibly pissed off customer calls, an on demand CV 
   tool..."]

6.1.1. Configuration considerations 

   For on-demand CV the MEP should support the configuration of the 
   number of packets to be transmitted/received in each burst of 
   transmissions and their packet size. The transmission rate should be 
   configured between the different nodes. 

   In addition, when the CV packet is used to check connectivity toward 
   a target MIP, the number of hops to reach the target MIP should be 
   configured. 

   The PHB of the on-demand CV packets should be configured as well. 

   [Editor's note - We need to be better define the reason for such 
   configuration] 

6.2. Packet Loss Monitoring 

   On-demand Packet Loss (LM) is one of the capabilities supported by 
   the MPLS-TP Performance Monitoring function in order to facilitate 
   diagnostic of QoS performance for a transport path. As proactive LM, 
   on-demand LM is used to exchange counter values for the number of 
   ingress and egress packets transmitted and received by the transport 
   path monitored by a pair of MEPs.   

   On-demand LM is performed by periodically sending LM OAM packets from 
   a MEP to a peer MEP and by receiving LM OAM packets from the peer MEP 
   (if a bidirectional transport path) during a pre-defined monitoring 
   period. Each MEP performs measurements of its transmitted and 
   received packets. These measurements are then correlated evaluate the 
   packet loss performance metrics of the transport path. [Dave: again 
   are we discussing simply discard eligibility and no other PHB 
   impacts?] 

6.2.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support on-demand LM, the beginning and duration of the 
   LM procedures, the transmission rate and PHB associated with the LM 
   OAM packets originating from a MEP must be configured as part of the 
   on-demand LM provisioning procedures. LM OAM packets should be 
   transmitted with the PHB that yields the lowest packet loss 
   performance among the PHB Scheduling Classes or Ordered Aggregates 
   (see RFC 3260 [15]) in the monitored transport path for the relevant 
   network domain(s).

6.2.2. Applications for On-demand Packet Loss Monitoring 

   On-demand LM is relevant for the following applications: 

   o Single-end performance monitoring: diagnostic of the packet loss 
      performance of a transport path for SLA trouble shooting purposes. 

   o Single-end performance monitoring: diagnostic of the packet loss 
      performance of a PHB Scheduling Class or Ordering Aggregate within 
      a transport path for QoS trouble shooting purposes. 

6.3. Diagnostic 

   To be incorporated in a future revision of this document 

   [Munich: Need to describe the two types of loopback - LBM/LBR and 
   traffic loopback enhanced with variable sized packets in the on 
   demand cases. 

   One objective of diags is fault location, we need to make clear how 
   we apply the tools to fault location. 

   At the top of each section we need to describe the detailed 
   requirements and then in the rest of the section describe how it is 
   met.] 

6.4. Route Tracing 

   After e.g. provisioning an MPLS-TP LSP or for trouble shooting 
   purposes, it is often necessary to trace a route covered by an ME 
   from a source MEP to the sink MEP including all the MIPs in-between. 
   The route tracing function is providing this functionality. Based on 
   the fate sharing requirement of OAM flows, i.e. OAM packets receive 
   the same forwarding treatment as data packet, route tracing is a 
   basic means to perform CV and, to a much lesser degree, CC. For this 
   function to work properly, a return path must be present. 

   Route tracing might be implemented in different ways and this 
   document does not preclude any of them. Route trace could be 
   implemented e.g. by an MPLS traceroute-like function [RFC4379]. 
   However, route tracing should always return the full list of MIPs and 
   the peer MEP in it answer(s). In case a defect exist, the route trace 
   function needs to be able to detect it and stop automatically 
   returning the incomplete list of OAM entities that it was able to 
   trace.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework             October 2009 
    

   The configuration of the route trace function must at least support 
   the setting of the trace depth (number of hops)_and the number of 
   trace attempts before it gives up. Default setting need to be 
   configurable by the operator, too. 

6.5. Delay Measurement 

   Delay Measurement (DM) is one of the capabilities supported by the 
   MPLS-TP PM function in order to facilitate reporting of QoS 
   information for a transport path. Specifically, on-demand DM is used 
   to measure packet delay and packet delay variation in the transport 
   path monitored by a pair of MEPs during a pre-defined monitoring 
   period.   

   On-Demand DM is performed by sending periodic DM OAM packets from a 
   MEP to a peer MEP and by receiving DM OAM packets from the peer MEP 
   (if a bidirectional transport path) during a configurable time 
   interval.  

   On-demand DM can be operated in two ways: 

   o One-way: a MEP sends DM OAM packet to its peer MEP containing all 
      the required information to facilitate one-way packet delay and/or 
      one-way packet delay variation measurements at the peer MEP. 

   o Two-way: a MEP sends DM OAM packet with a DM request to its peer 
      MEP, which replies with an DM OAM packet as a DM response. The 
      request/response DM OAM packets containing all the required 
      information to facilitate two-way packet delay and/or two-way 
      packet delay variation measurements from the viewpoint of the 
      source MEP. 

6.5.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support on-demand DM, the beginning and duration of the 
   DM procedures, the transmission rate and PHB associated with the DM 
   OAM packets originating from a MEP need be configured as part of the 
   LM provisioning procedures. DM OAM packets should be transmitted with 
   the PHB that yields the lowest packet delay performance among the PHB 
   Scheduling Classes or Ordering Aggregates (see RFC 3260 [15]) in the 
   monitored transport path for the relevant network domain(s). 

   In order to verify different performances between long and short 
   packets (e.g., due to the processing time), it SHOULD be possible for 
   the operator to configure of the on-demand OAM DM packet.

6.5.2. Applications for Delay Measurement 

   DM is relevant for the following applications: 

   o Single or double-end performance monitoring: determination of the 
      packet delay and/or delay variation performance of a transport 
      path for SLA verification purposes. 

   o Single or double-end performance monitoring: determination of the 
      packet delay and/or delay variation a PHB Scheduling Class or 
      Ordering Aggregate within a transport path 

   o Contribution to service unable time. Packet delay measurements may 
      contribute to performance metrics such as near-end severely 
      errored seconds (Near-End SES) and far-end severely errored 
      seconds (Far-End SES), which together contribute to unavailable 
      time.  

6.6. Lock Instruct 

   To be incorporated in a future revision of this document 

7. Security Considerations 

   A number of security considerations are important in the context of 
   OAM applications.  

   OAM traffic can reveal sensitive information such as passwords, 
   performance data and details about e.g. the network topology. The 
   nature of OAM data therefore suggests to have some form of 
   authentication, authorization and encryption in place. This will 
   prevent unauthorized access to vital equipment and it will prevent 
   third parties from learning about sensitive information about the 
   transport network. 

   Mechanisms that the framework does not specify might be subject to 
   additional security considerations. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   No new IANA considerations.

Abstract

   A range of Management Information Base (MIB) modules has been
   developed to help model and manage the various aspects of
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks.  These MIB modules are
   defined in separate documents that focus on the specific areas of
   responsibility of the modules that they describe.

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile of MPLS
   functionality specific to the construction of packet-switched
   transport networks.

   This document describes the MIB-based architecture for MPLS-TP, 
   and indicates the interrelationships between different existing MIB 
   modules that can be leveraged for MPLS-TP network management and
   identifies areas where additional MIB modules would be required.

1. Introduction

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a packet transport
   technology based on a profile of the MPLS functionality specific
   to the construction of packet-switched transport networks. 
   MPLS is described in [RFC3031] and requirements for MPLS-TP are
   specified in [RFC5654].

   A range of Management Information Base (MIB) modules has been
   developed to help model and manage the various aspects of
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks. These MIB modules
   are defined in separate documents that focus on the specific areas of
   responsibility of the modules that they describe.

   An MPLS-TP network can be operated via static provisioning of 
   transport paths, or the elective use of a Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
   control plane to support dynamic provisioning of transport paths.
   
   This document describes the MIB-based management architecture for 
   MPLS-TP and indicates the interrelationships between different 
   existing MIB modules that should be leveraged for MPLS-TP network
   management, if SNMP is used for the management interface and 
   identifies areas where additional MIB modules would be required. Note 
   that [RFC5951] does not specify a preferred management interface 
   protocol to be used as the standard protocol for managing MPLS-TP 
   networks.

1.1 MPLS-TP Management Function

   The management of the MPLS-TP networks is inseparable from that of 
   its client networks so that the same means of management can be used
   regardless of the client. The management functions of MPLS-TP
   includes fault management, configuration management, performance
   monitoring, and security management.
   
   The purpose of the management function is to provide control and 
   monitoring over the protocol mechanisms and procedures that 
   constitute the building blocks for a transport profile of MPLS.
   The requirements for the network management functionality are
   found in [RFC5951].  A description of the network and element 
   management architectures that can be applied to the management
   of MPLS-based transport networks is found in [RFC5950].
   

2. Terminology

   This document also uses terminology from the MPLS architecture 
   document [RFC3031] and the following MPLS related MIB modules:
   MPLS TC MIB [RFC3811], MPLS LSR MIB [RFC3813], MPLS TE MIB [RFC3812],
   MPLS LDP MIB [RFC3815], MPLS FTN MIB [RFC3814] and TE LINK MIB 
   [RFC4220].
    

3. The SNMP Management Framework

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   This document discusses MIB modules that are compliant to the SMIv2,
   which is described in [RFC2578], [RFC2579] and [RFC2580].


4. Overview of Existing Work

   This section describes the existing tools and techniques for
   managing and modeling MPLS networks, devices, and protocols. It is 
   intended to provide a description of the tool kit that is already 
   available. 
  
   Section 5 of this document outlines the applicability of existing
   MPLS MIB modules to MPLS-TP, describes the optional use of GMPLS MIB
   modules in MPLS-TP networks, and examines the additional MIB modules
   and objects that would be required for managing an MPLS-TP network.

4.1. MPLS Management Overview and Requirements

   [RFC4378] outlines how data plane protocols can assist in providing 
   the Operations and Management (OAM) requirements outlined in 
   [RFC4377] and how it is applied to the management functions of fault,
   configuration, accounting, performance, and security (commonly known
   as FCAPS) for MPLS networks.

   [RFC4221] describes the management architecture for MPLS. In 
   particular, it describes how the managed objects defined in various
   MPLS-related MIB modules model different aspects of MPLS, as well as
   the interactions and dependencies between each of these MIB modules.
   
   [RFC4377] describes the requirements for user and data plane OAM and
   applications for MPLS.  
   
   [RFC5654] describes the requirements for the optional use of a 
   control plane to support dynamic provisioning of MPLS-TP transport
   paths. The MPLS-TP LSP control plane is based on GMPLS and is 
   described in [RFC3945].   

4.2. An Introduction to the MPLS and Pseudowire MIB Modules

4.2.1. Structure of the MPLS MIB OID Tree

   The MPLS MIB OID tree has the following structure. It is based on the
   tree originally set out in section 4.1 of [RFC4221] and has been 
   enhanced to include other relevant MIB modules.

   MPLS-TC-STD-MIB [RFC3811], GMPLS-TC-STD-MIB [RFC4801], 
   IANA-GMPLS-TC-MIB [RFC4802] and PW-TC-STD-MIB [RFC5542] contains the
   Textual Conventions for MPLS and GMPLS networks.  These Textual
   Conventions should be imported by MIB modules which manage MPLS
   and GMPLS networks. Section 3.2.11. highlights dependencies on 
   additional external MIB modules
   
4.2.3. Label Edge Router (LER) Modules

   Label Edge Router (LER) Module helps in mapping data to LSP's
   based on the network layer header. The ingress device of the MPLS
   network is called Label Edge Routers (LER). 

   At the LER when an unlabelled packet enters the ingress interface,
   network layer header is parsed to classify the packet to a forwarding
   equivalence class (FEC). Each FEC is mapped to an LFIB entry to 
   encapsulate the unlabelled packet with one or more label entries
   referred to as the label stack. Each label stack entry consists of a
   label, the 3 TC-bits for classifying the Traffic Class, the bottom of
   stack bit, and TTL.

   MPLS-FTN-STD-MIB [RFC3814] describes the managed objects for mapping
   FEC's to label bindings.

4.2.4. Label Switching Router Modules

   A router which performs MPLS forwarding is known as an LSR. An LSR
   receives a labelled packet and performs forwarding action based on 
   the label received.
 
   LSR maintains a mapping of an incoming label and incoming interface 
   to one or more outgoing label and outgoing interfaces in its 
   forwarding database. When a labelled packet is received, LSR examines
   the topmost label in the label stack and then does 'swap', 'push' or 
   'pop' operation based on the contents.
   
   MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC3813] describes the managed objects for modeling
   a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) [RFC3031] LSR. 
   MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC3813] contains the managed objects to maintain 
   mapping of in-segments to out-segments.
   
4.2.5. Label Switched Path Modules

   The path taken through the MPLS domain by a packet is referred to as
   a label switched path (LSP). It is possible that this path may not be
   understood or completely stored in any one LSR within the MPLS 
   domain.

   MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC3813] describes the required objects to define
   the LSP.

4.2.6. Pseudowire Modules

   The PW (Pseudowire) MIB architecture provides a layered 
   modular model into which any supported emulated service such as Frame
   Relay, ATM, Ethernet, TDM and SONET/SDH can be connected to any
   supported packet switched network (PSN) type. This MIB architecture 
   is modeled based on PW3 architecture [RFC3985].

   Emulated Service Layer, Generic PW Layer and PSN VC Layer constitute
   the different layers of the model. A combination of the MIB modules
   belonging to each layer provides the glue for mapping the emulated
   service onto the native PSN service. At least three MIB modules each
   belonging to a different layer are required to define a PW emulated
   service.

   o Service-Specific module is dependent on the emulated signal type 
     and helps in modeling emulated service layer.

   PW-ENET-STD-MIB [RFC5603] describes a model for managing Ethernet
   pseudowire services for transmission over a PSN. This MIB module is
   generic and common to all types of PSNs supported in the Pseudowire
   Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architecture [RFC3985], which describes
   the transport and encapsulation of L1 and L2 services over supported
   PSN types.

   In particular, the MIB module associates a port or specific VLANs on
   top of a physical Ethernet port or a virtual Ethernet interface (for
   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)) to a point-to-point PW.  It is
   complementary to the PW-STD-MIB [RFC5601], which manages the generic
   PW parameters common to all services, including all supported PSN
   types.

   PW-TDM-MIB [RFC5604] describes a model for managing TDM pseudowires,
   i.e., TDM data encapsulated for transmission over a Packet Switched
   Network (PSN).  The term TDM in this document is limited to the 
   scope of Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH).  It is currently
   specified to carry any TDM Signals in either Structure Agnostic
   Transport mode (E1, T1, E3, and T3) or in Structure Aware
   Transport mode (E1, T1, and NxDS0) as defined in the Pseudowire
   Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) TDM Requirements document [RFC4197].
 
   o Generic PW Module configures general parameters of the PW that are
     common to all types of emulated services and PSN types.

   PW-STD-MIB [RFC5601] defines a MIB module that can be
   used to manage pseudowire (PW) services for transmission over a
   Packet Switched Network (PSN) [RFC3931] [RFC4447].  This MIB module
   provides generic management of PWs that is common to all types of
   PSN and PW services defined by the IETF PWE3 Working Group.


King & Venkatesan,  et al.                                     [Page 8]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-04.txt             June 2011


   o PSN-specific module associate the PW with one or more "tunnels" 
     that carry the service over the PSN.  There is a different module
     for each type of PSN.
   
   PW-MPLS-STD-MIB [RFC5602] describes a model for managing pseudowire
   services for transmission over different flavors of MPLS tunnels.
   The general PW MIB module [RFC5601] defines the parameters global to
   the PW regardless of the underlying Packet Switched Network (PSN) 
   and emulated service.  This document is applicable for PWs that use
   MPLS PSN type in the PW-STD-MIB. Additionally this document describes
   the MIB objects that define pseudowire association to the MPLS PSN, 
   that is not specific to the carried service.

   Together, [RFC3811], [RFC3812] and [RFC3813] describe the modeling of
   an MPLS tunnel, and a tunnel's underlying cross-connects.  This MIB
   module supports MPLS-TE PSN, non-TE MPLS PSN (an outer tunnel created
   by the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) or manually), and MPLS PW
   label only (no outer tunnel).

4.2.7. Routing and Traffic Engineering

   In MPLS traffic engineering, it's possible to specify explicit routes
   or choose routes based on QOS metrics in setting up a path such that
   some specific data can be routed around network hot spots. TE LSPs 
   can be setup through a management plane or a control plane.

   MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812] describes managed objects for modeling a
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) [RFC3031] based traffic
   engineering.  This MIB module should be used in conjunction with the
   companion document [RFC3813] for MPLS based traffic engineering
   configuration and management.

4.2.8. Resiliency

   An MPLS resiliency is to make sure that there is no interruption to
   traffic when the failure occurs within the system or network.
 
   Various components of MPLS resiliency solutions are,
   1) Graceful restart in LDP and RSVP-TE modules
   2) Make Before Break
   3) Protection Switching for LSPs
   4) Fast ReRoute for LSPs
   5) PW redundancy

   The below modules only support the SNMP based mib management
   for MPLS resiliency.

   MPLS Fast Reroute is a restoration network resiliency mechanism used 
   in MPLS TE to redirect the traffic onto the backup LSP's in 10s of
   milliseconds in case of link or node failure across the LSP.

draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-04.txt             June 2011


   MPLS-FRR-GENERAL-STD-MIB [draft-ietf-mpls-fastreroute-mib-14] 
   contains objects that apply to any MPLS LSR implementing MPLS TE fast
   reroute functionality.
 
   MPLS-FRR-ONE2ONE-STD-MIB [draft-ietf-mpls-fastreroute-mib-14] 
   contains objects that apply to one-to-one backup method.
   MPLS-FRR-FACILITY-STD-MIB [draft-ietf-mpls-fastreroute-mib-14] 
   contains objects that apply to facility backup method.

   Protection Switching mechanisms have been designed to provide network
   resiliency for MPLS network. Different types of protection switching
   mechanisms such as 1:1, 1:N, 1+1 have been designed.
   
4.2.9. Fault Management and Performance Management 

   MPLS manages the LSP and pseudowire faults through the use of LSP 
   ping [RFC4379], VCCV [RFC5085], BFD for LSPs [RFC5884] and BFD for
   VCCV [RFC5885] tools.
   
   Current MPLS focuses on the in and/or out packet counters,
   errored packets, discontinuity time.

   Some of the MPLS and Pseudowire performance tables used for
   performance management are given below.

   mplsTunnelPerfTable provides several counters (packets forwarded,
   packets dropped because of errors) to measure the performance of
   the MPLS tunnels.

   mplsInterfacePerfTable provides performance information (incoming and
   outgoing labels in use and lookup failures) on a per-interface basis.

   mplsInSegmentPerfTable contains statistical information (total 
   packets received by the insegment, total errored packets received,
   total packets discarded, discontinuity time) for incoming MPLS 
   segments to an LSR.

   mplsOutSegmentPerfTable contains statistical information (total 
   packets received, total errored packets received, total packets 
   discarded, discontinuity time) for outgoing MPLS segments from an
   LSR.

   mplsFTNPerfTable contains performance information for the specified
   interface and an FTN entry mapped to this interface.

   mplsLdpEntityStatsTable and mplsLdpSessionStatsTable contain 
   statistical information (session attempts, errored packets, 
   notifications) about an LDP entity.

draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-04.txt             June 2011


   pwPerfCurrentTable, pwPerfIntervalTable, pwPerf1DayIntervalTable
   provides pseudowire performance information (in and/or out packets)
   based on time (current interval, preconfigured specific interval,
   1day interval).

   pwEnetStatsTable contains statistical counters specific for Ethernet
   PW.

   pwTDMPerfCurrentTable, pwTDMPerfIntervalTable and 
   pwTDMPerf1DayIntervalTable contain statistical informations 
   accumulated per 15-minute, 24 hour, 1 day respectively.
   gmplsTunnelErrorTable and gmplsTunnelReversePerfTable provides 
   information about performance errored packets and in/out packet
   counters.
  
4.2.10. MIB Module Interdependencies

   This section provides an overview of the relationship between the
   MPLS MIB modules for managing MPLS networks. More details of these 
   relationships are given below.
 
   [RFC4221] mainly focuses on the MPLS MIB module interdependencies, 
   this section also highlights the GMPLS and PW MIB modules
   interdependencies.
   
   The relationship "A --> B" means A depends on B and that MIB module 
   A uses an object, object identifier, or textual convention defined
   in MIB module B, or that MIB module A contains a pointer (index or
   RowPointer) to an object in MIB module B.

   +<---------------- PW-MPLS-STD-MIB -------------------------------->+
   
   Thus:

   -  All the MPLS MIB modules depend on MPLS-TC-STD-MIB.
  
   -  All the GMPLS MIB modules depend on GMPLS-TC-STD-MIB.
   
   -  All the PW MIB modules depend on PW-TC-STD-MIB.

   -  MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB, MPLS-TE-STD-MIB, MPLS-FTN-STD-MIB, 
      GMPLS-LSR-STD-MIB, and PW-MPLS-STD-MIB contain references to 
      objects in MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB.

   -  MPLS-LDP-GENERIC-STD-MIB contains references to objects in 
      MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB.


King & Venkatesan,  et al.                                    [Page 12]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-04.txt             June 2011


   -  MPLS-FTN-STD-MIB, PW-MPLS-STD-MIB, and GMPLS-TE-STD-MIB contain 
      references to objects in MPLS-TE-STD-MIB.
   
   -  PW-MPLS-STD-MIB, and PW-ENET-STD-MIB contains references to 
      objects in PW-STD-MIB. 
   
   -  PW-STD-MIB contains references to objects in IANA-PWE3-MIB.

   -  GMPLS-TE-STD-MIB contains references to objects in 
      IANA-GMPLS-TC-MIB.

   -  GMPLS-LSR-STD-MIB contains references to objects in 
      GMPLS-LABEL-STD-MIB. 

   Note that there is a textual convention (MplsIndexType) defined in
   MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB that is imported by MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB.

4.2.11. Dependencies on External MIB Modules

   With the exception of MPLS-TC-STD-MIB, all the MPLS MIB modules have
   dependencies on the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863].  MPLS-FTN-STD-MIB
   references IP-capable interfaces on which received traffic is to be
   classified using indexes in the Interface Table (ifTable) of IF-MIB
   [RFC2863].  The other MPLS MIB modules reference MPLS-capable
   interfaces in ifTable.

   The Interfaces Group of IF-MIB [RFC2863] defines generic managed
   objects for managing interfaces.  The MPLS MIB modules contain
   media-specific extensions to the Interfaces Group for managing MPLS
   interfaces.

   The MPLS MIB modules assume the interpretation of the Interfaces
   Group to be in accordance with [RFC2863], which states that ifTable
   contains information on the managed resource's interfaces and that
   each sub-layer below the internetwork layer of a network interface is
   considered an interface.  Thus, the MPLS interface is represented as
   an entry in ifTable.

   The interrelation of entries in ifTable is defined by the Interfaces
   Stack Group defined in [RFC2863].
   
   The MPLS MIB modules have dependencies with the TE-LINK-STD-MIB 
   for maintaining the traffic engineering information.

   The MPLS MIB modules depend on the constrained shortest path first 
   (CSPF) module to obtain the path required for an MPLS tunnel to reach
   the end point of the tunnel and BFD module to verify the data-plane 
   failures of LSPs and PWs.



King & Venkatesan,  et al.                                    [Page 13]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-04.txt             June 2011


   Finally, all of the MIB modules import standard textual conventions
   such as integers, strings, timestamps, etc., from the MIB modules in
   which they are defined.

5. Applicability of MPLS MIB modules to MPLS-TP

   This section and its sub sections focus on the possible gaps that 
   exist in the MPLS MIB modules to extend its use to MPLS-TP networks.
   
   [RFC5951] specifies the requirements for the management of
   equipment used in networks supporting an MPLS-TP. It also details the
   essential network management capabilities for operating networks
   consisting of MPLS-TP equipment.

   [RFC5950] provides the network management framework for
   MPLS-TP. The document explains how network elements and networks that
   support MPLS-TP can be managed using solutions that satisfy the
   requirements defined in [RFC5951]. The relationship between
   MPLS-TP management and OAM is described in the MPLS-TP framework
   [RFC5950] document.

   The MPLS mib modules MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812], PW-STD-MIB [RFC5601]
   and MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC3813] and their associated mib modules are 
   reused for MPLS based transport network management.
      
   Fault management and performance management form key parts of
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) function. MPLS-TP
   OAM is described in [MPLS-TP-OAM-FWK].
   
   A seperate draft will provide an MPLS-TP abstract model and use a 
   formal language to define the terminology, the information that 
   must be retrieved and method for storing. 
  
5.1 MPLS-TP Tunnel
  
5.1.1 Gap Analysis

  MPLS-TP tunnel can be operated over IP and/or ICC environments, 
  below points capture the gaps in existing MPLS mib modules 
  for managing the MPLS-TP networks.

   o IP based environment
      i. MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812] does not support
         tunnel LSR identifier based on Global_ID and Node_ID.
      ii. MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812] does not support
          corouted/associated bidirectional tunnel configurations.    





King & Venkatesan,  et al.                                    [Page 14]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-04.txt             June 2011


   o ICC based environment   
      i. MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812] does not support
         tunnel LSR identifier based on ICC.
     ii. MPLS tunnel does not support forwarding other
         than the nexthop IP address.
    
5.1.2 Recommendations

   o New MIB definitions can be created for Global_Node_ID and/or 
     ICC configurations.
   o MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC3813] mib module can be enhanced to identify
     the nexthop based on MAC address for IP-less environment. 
   o MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812] and MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB should be 
     enhanced to provide static and signalling mib module 
     extensions for corouted/associated bidirectional LSPs.
   
5.2 MPLS-TP Pseudowire

5.2.1 Gap Analysis

   MPLS-TP Pseudowire can be operated over IP and/or ICC environments, 
   below points capture the gaps in existing PW mib modules 
   for managing the MPLS-TP networks.

   o IP based environment
      i. PW-STD-MIB [RFC5601] does not support
         PW end point identifier based on Global_ID and Node_ID.
      ii. PW-MPLS-STD-MIB [RFC5602] does not support
         its opeation over corouted/associated bidirectional tunnels.

   o ICC based environment   
      i. PW-STD-MIB [RFC5601] does not support
         PW end point identifier based on ICC.
     ii. Pseudowire does not support forwarding other
         than the nexthop IP address.
   
5.2.2 Recommendations
  
   o PW-MPLS-STD-MIB [RFC5602] can be enhanced to operate over 
     corouted/associated bi-directional tunnel.
   o Pseudowire 129 FEC type-2 can be used in non-IP and IP 
     environments with the required changes.

5.3 MPLS-TP Sections

5.3.1 Gap Analysis  
   
   The existing MPLS MIB modules does not support MPLS-TP sections. 

5.3.2 Recommendations

King & Venkatesan,  et al.                                    [Page 15]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-04.txt             June 2011

  
   Link specific and/or path/segment specific sections can be achieved
   by enhancing the IF-MIB [RFC2863], MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812] and
   PW-STD-MIB [RFC5601] mib modules.

5.4 MPLS-TP OAM

5.4.1 Gap Analysis  

   MPLS manages the LSP and pseudowire faults through LSP ping 
   [RFC4379], VCCV [RFC5085], BFD for LSPs [RFC5884] and BFD for VCCV
   [RFC5885] tools. 

   The MPLS mib modules do not support the below MPLS-TP OAM functions,
    o Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification
    o Remote Defect Indication
    o Route Tracing
    o Alarm Reporting
    o Lock Reporting
    o Lock Instruct
    o Client Failure Indication
    o Packet Loss Measurement
    o Packet Delay Measurement 
   
5.4.2 Recommendations
  
   New mib modules for BFD and LSP Ping can be created to address
   all the gaps mentioned in the 5.4.1 Gap Analysis section.

5.5 MPLS-TP Protection Switching and Recovery

5.5.1 Gap Analysis  

   An important aspect that MPLS-TP technology provides is protection
   switching. In general, the mechanism of protection switching 
   can be described as the substitution of a protection or standby 
   facility for a working or primary facility. 
   
   The MPLS mib modules do not provide support for protection switching
   and recovery of three different topologies (linear, ring and mesh)
   available.
 
5.5.2 Recommendations
   
   New mib modules can be created to address all the gaps mentioned
   in the 5.5.1 Gap Analysis section.

5.6 MPLS-TP Interfaces

5.6.1 Gap Analysis
   

King & Venkatesan,  et al.                                    [Page 16]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-04.txt             June 2011


   As per [MPLS-TP-IDENTIFIERS], an LSR requires identification of the
   node itself and of its interfaces.  An interface is the attachment 
   point to a server layer MPLS-TP section or MPLS-TP tunnel.

   The MPLS mib modules do not provide support for configuring
   the interfaces within the context of an operator.

5.6.2 Recommendations
 
   New mib defintions can be created to address the gaps mentioned
   in the 5.6.1 Gap Analysis section.  

6. An Introduction to the MPLS-TP MIB Modules

   This section highlights new MIB modules that have been identified 
   as being required for MPLS-TP. This section also provides an overview
   of the following:

   -  the MPLS Object Identifier (OID) tree structure and the position
      of different MPLS related MIB modules on this tree;

   -  the purpose of each of the MIB modules within the MIB documents,
      what it can be used for, and how it relates to the other MIB
      modules.

   Note that each new MIB module (apart from Textual Conventions
   modules) will contain one or more Compliance Statements to indicate
   which objects must be suppor in what manner to claim a specific level
   of compliance. Additional text, either in the documents that define
   the MIB modules or in separate Applicability Statements, will define
   which Compliance Statements need tbe conformed to in order to provide
   specific MPLS-TP function. This document does not set any
   requirements in that respect although some recommendations are
   included in the sections that follow.

6.1 MPLS-TP MIB Modules

6.1.1 Structure of the MPLS-TP MIB OID Tree

   The MPLS-TP MIB OID tree has the following structure.

      transmission -- RFC 2578 [RFC2578]
        |
        +- mplsStdMIB
             |
             +- Textual Conventions for MPLS-TP
             |
             +- Identifiers for MPLS-TP
             |
             +- LSR MIB Extensions for MPLS-TP
             |
             +- TE MIB Extensions for MPLS-TP

King & Venkatesan,  et al.                                    [Page 17]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-04.txt             June 2011


   Note that the mib modules mentioned here are applicable
   for MPLS operations as well.

   Note: The OIDs for MIB modules are yet to be assigned and managed by
   IANA.

6.1.2 Textual Conventions for MPLS-TP 

   New textual convention mib module defines textual
   conventions [RFC2579] for MPLS-TP related MIB modules. 
   These conventions allow multiple MIB modules to use the
   same syntax and format for a concept that is shared between
   the MIB modules. 

   For example, MEP identifier is used to identify maintenance entity 
   group end point within MPLS-TP networks. The textual convention 
   representing the MEP identifier is defined in new textual convention
   mib module. 

   All new extensions related to MPLS-TP are defined in the MIB module 
   and will be referenced by other MIB modules to support MPLS-TP.

6.1.3 Identifiers for MPLS-TP
   
   New Identifiers describe managed objects that are used to model 
   common MPLS-TP identifiers [MPLS-TP-IDENTIFIERS].

6.1.4 LSR MIB Extensions for MPLS-TP

   MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB describes managed objects for modeling an MPLS Label
   Switching Router (LSR).  This puts it at the heart of the management
   architecture for MPLS.

   In the case of MPLS-TP, the MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB is extended to support 
   the MPLS-TP LSP's, which are corouted or associated bidirectional.
   This extended MIB is also applicable for modeling MPLS-TP tunnels.

6.1.5 Tunnel Extensions for MPLS-TP
   
   MPLS-TE-STD-MIB describes managed objects that are used to model and
   manage MPLS Traffic Engineered (TE) Tunnels.

   MPLS-TP tunnels are much similar to MPLS-TE tunnels, but are 
   bidirectional and could be co-routed or associated.
   The MPLS-TE-STD-MIB is extended to support the MPLS-TP specific
   attributes for the tunnel.

   This section provides an overview of Pseudowire extension mib 
   modules to meet the MPLS based transport network requirements.

   Note: The OIDs for MIB modules are yet to be assigned and managed by 
   IANA.

6.2.2 Pseudowire Textual Conventions for MPLS-TP

   PW-TC-STD-MIB MIB defines textual conventions used for pseudowire
   (PW) technology and for Pseudowire Edge-to-Edge Emulation (PWE3) MIB
   Modules. New textual convention mib module defines textual
   definitions for MPLS-TP specific Pseudowire attributes.
   
6.2.3 Pseudowire Extensions for MPLS-TP

   PW-STD-MIB describes managed objects for modeling of Pseudowire 
   Edge-to-Edge services carried over a general Packet Switched Network. 
   This MIB module is extended to support MPLS-TP specific attributes
   related to Pseudowires.

6.2.4 Pseudowire MPLS Extensions for MPLS-TP
 
   PW-MPLS-STD-MIB defines the managed objects for Pseudowire 
   operations over MPLS LSR's. This MIB supports both, 
   manual and dynamically signaled PW's, point-to-point connections, 
   enables the use of any emulated service, MPLS-TE as outer tunnel 
   and no outer tunnel as MPLS-TE.

   The newly extended MIB defines the managed objects, 
   extending PW-MPLS-STD-MIB, by supporting with or without
   MPLS-TP as outer tunnel.
   
6.3 OAM MIB Modules for MPLS-TP

   This section provides an overview of Operations, Administration, 
   and Maintenance (OAM) mib modules for MPLS LSPs and Pseudowires.

        +- OAM MIB module

   Note: The OIDs for MIB modules are yet to be assigned and managed by 
   IANA.

6.3.2 LSP Ping MIB module

   LSP ping is defined in [RFC4379] to validate data plane consistency 
   of MPLS LSP's. It defines how LSP ping and Trace Route could be 
   performed across MPLS networks to identify and diagnose faults 
   within MPLS networks. This OAM functionality is performed on demand
   basis for verification purposes.

   New mib module defines managed objects for modeling LSP ping
   protocol. It allows user to perform on demand operations based on 
   [RFC4379].

   For example, a MPLS-TP tunnel LSP is to be pinged, a SNMP request 
   issued using the MIB for the tunnel in test. The results for the 
   operation could be queried using the managed objects defined in the 
   MIB module.

6.3.3 BFD MIB module

   BFD-STD-MIB defines managed objects for performing BFD operation in 
   IP networks. This MIB is modeled to support BFD protocol [RFC5880]. 
   New mib module is an extension to BFD-STD-MIB managed objects 
   to support BFD operations on MPLS LSPs and PWs. 

6.3.4 Common OAM MIB modules
   
   New mib module defines managed objects for OAM maintenance 
   identifiers i.e. Maintenance Entity Group Identifiers (MEG), 
   Maintenance Entity Group End-point (MEP), Maintenance Entity Group
   Intermediate Point (MIP). Maintenance points are uniquely 
   associated with a MEG. Within the context of a MEG, MEPs and MIPs 
   must be uniquely identified.

6.4. Protection Switching and Recovery MIB Modules for MPLS-TP

   This section provides an overview of protection switching and 
   recovery MIB modules for MPLS LSPs and Pseudowires.

   Note: The OIDs for MIB modules are yet to be assigned and managed by 
   IANA.

6.4.2 Linear Protection Switching MIB module

   New mib module defines managed objects for linear protection 
   switching of MPLS LSPs and Pseudowires.

6.4.3 Ring Protection Switching MIB module

   New mib module defines managed objects for ring protection 
   switching of MPLS LSPs and Pseudowires.

6.4.4 Mesh Protection Switching MIB module

   New mib module defines managed objects for Mesh protection 
   switching of MPLS LSPs and Pseudowires.

7. Management Options

   This document applies only to scenarios where MIB modules are used to
   manage the MPLS-TP network. It is not the intention of this document
   to provide instructions or advice to implementers of management 
   systems, management agents, or managed entities.  It is, however,
   useful to make some observations about how the MIB modules described
   above might be used to manage MPLS systems, if SNMP is used in the 
   management interface.
   
   For MPLS specific management options, refer [RFC4221] Section 12 
   (Management Options).


8. Security Considerations



King & Venkatesan,  et al.                                    [Page 21]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-04.txt             June 2011


   This document describes the interrelationships amongst the different
   MIB modules relevant to MPLS-TP management and as such does not have
   any security implications in and of itself.

   Each IETF MIB document that specifies MIB objects for MPLS-TP must
   provide a proper security considerations section that explains the
   security aspects of those objects.

   The attention of readers is particularly drawn to the security
   implications of making MIB objects available for create or write
   access through an access protocol such as SNMP.  SNMPv1 by itself is
   an insecure environment.  Even if the network itself is made secure
   (for example, by using IPSec), there is no control over who on the
   secure network is allowed to access the objects in this MIB.  It is
   recommended that the implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the 
   User-based Security Model STD 62, RFC3414 [RFC3414], and the 
   View-based Access Control Model STD 62, RFC 3415 [RFC3415],
   is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of each MIB module is properly
   configured to give access to only those objects, and to those
   principals (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.


9. IANA Considerations
   
   This document makes no requests for IANA action.

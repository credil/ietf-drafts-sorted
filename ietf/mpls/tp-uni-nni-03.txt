Abstract

   The framework for MPLS in transport networks (RFC 5921) provides
   reference models for the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) transport
   service interfaces, which are a User-to-Network Interface (UNI), and
   an MPLS-TP Network-to-Network Interface (NNI).  This document updates
   those reference models to show detailed reference points for these
   interfaces, along with further clarification of the functional
   architecture of MPLS-TP at a UNI and NNI.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge
   (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
   of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.

   This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving IETF
   Consensus before publication as an RFC and will be subject to an IETF
   Last Call.

1.  Introduction

   The framework for MPLS in transport networks [RFC5921] provides
   reference models for the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) transport
   service interfaces, which are a User-to-Network Interface (UNI), and
   an MPLS-TP Network-to-Network Interface (NNI).  This document updates
   those reference models to show detailed reference points for these
   interfaces, along with further clarification of the functional
   architecture of MPLS-TP at a UNI and NNI.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as
   defined by the ITU-T.

1.1.  Updates to the MPLS-TP UNI and NNI

   The transport service interfaces for MPLS-TP are defined in Section
   3.4.3 of [RFC5921].  These definitions are illustrated by showing
   MPLS-TP PEs containing a UNI and an NNI.  The figures illustrate the
   UNI and the NNI as a span.  However, it is convention to illustrate
   these interfaces as reference points.  Furthermore, in the case of a
   UNI, it is useful to illustrate the distribution of UNI functions
   between the Customer Edge (CE) side and the Provider Edge (PE) side
   of the UNI, i.e. the UNI-C (User-to-User Interface, Client side) and

   UNI-N (User-to-Network Interface, Network side), in order to show
   their relationship to one another.

   This document provides updated illustrations of the MPLS-TP UNI and
   MPLS-TP NNI to show these additional details.  These illustrations
   obsolete the corresponding ones in [RFC5921].  This document also
   defines additional terminology referenced in the illustrations.  No
   other updates are made by this document.

   Awareness of the Transport Service layer need exist only at PE nodes,
   and so only these nodes are illustrate in the figures.  MPLS-TP
   Provider (P) nodes need have no awareness of this layer.  Both PE and
   P nodes participate in the Transport Path layer.  A PE terminates
   (i.e., is an LER with respect to) the transport paths it supports,
   and is responsible for multiplexing and demultiplexing of Transport
   Service Instance traffic over such transport paths.

1.2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The terminology and abbreviations of [RFC5921] apply.

   The following additional terminology is used in this document.

   Term  Definition
   ----- ---------------------------------------
   CP    Control Plane
   NNI   Network-to-Network Interface
   TSI   Transport Service Instance
   UNI   User-to-Network Interface
   UNI-C User-to-Network Interface, Client side
   UNI-N User-to-Network Interface, Network side

   Transport Service Instance:  A single logical point-to-point
      connection at the Transport Service layer between the ingress PE
      providing a packet transport service to a CE, and the
      corresponding egress PE to which the peer CE is attached.


2.  MPLS-TP User-to-Network Interface

   The MPLS-TP User-to-Network Interface (UNI) is illustrated in
   Figure 1.  This figure obsoletes Figure 3 of [RFC5921].  Note that
   the term MPLS-TP UNI is to be interpreted as a UNI to an MPLS-TP
   network and does not refer to the protocol transiting the UNI.  The
   UNI for a particular client flow may involve signaling between the CE
   and PE.  If signaling is used, it may traverse the same attachment
   circuit that supports the client flow.

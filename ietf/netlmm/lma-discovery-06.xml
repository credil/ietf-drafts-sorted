         <t>A Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) <xref target="RFC5213"/>
            deployment would benefit from a functionality, where a
            Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) can dynamically discover a
            Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for a Mobile Node (MN)
            attaching to a PMIPv6 domain. The purpose of
            the dynamic discovery functionality is to reduce the
            amount of static configuration in the MAG. Other drivers for the
            dynamic discovery of a LMA include LMA load balancing solutions and
            selecting a LMA based on desired services. This
            document describes several possible dynamic LMA
            discovery approaches and makes a recommendation of the preferred one.

         <t>When a MN performs a handover from one MAG to
            another, the new MAG must use the same LMA that the old
            MAG was using. This is required for session
            continuity. The LMA discovery mechanism in the new
            MAG should be able to return the information of the
            same LMA that was being used by the old MAG. This document
            also discusses solutions for LMA discovery during a
            handover.
         </t>
       </section>

       <section title="AAA-based Discovery Solutions" anchor="aaasol">
         <t>This section presents a LMA discovery solution that
            requires a MAG to be connected to an AAA
            infrastructure for instance as described in <xref target="RFC5779"/>. The AAA infrastructure is also assumed to be aware of PMIPv6. A MN
            attaching to a PMIPv6 domain is typically required to provide
            authentication for network access and to be authorized for
            mobility services before the MN is allowed to 
            send or receive any IP packets or even complete its IP level
            configuration.  
         </t>
         <t>The AAA-based LMA discovery solution hooks into the
            network access authentication and authorization
            process. The MAG has also the role of a Network Access
            Server (NAS) at this step.  While the MN is
            attaching to the network, the PMIPv6 related parameters
            are bootstrapped in parallel with authentication for the network
            access and authorization for the mobility services. The
            PMIPv6 parameters bootstrapping involves the 
            Policy Profile download over the AAA infrastructure to the
            MAG (see Appendix A of <xref target="RFC5213"/>).
         </t>

         <section title="Receiving LMA Address during the Network
           Access Authentication" anchor="aaalma">
           <t>After the MN has successfully authenticated for the
              network access and authorized for the mobility 
              service, the MAG receives the LMA IP address from
              the AAA server over the AAA infrastructure. The LMA IP
              address information would be part of the AAA message
              that ends the successful authentication and
              authorization AAA exchange.
           </t>
           <t>Once the MAG receives the LMA IP address, it sends
              Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message for the newly
              authenticated and authorized MN. The MAG expects
              that the LMA returned by the AAA server is able to
              provide mobility session continuity for the MN,
              i.e. after a handover the LMA would be the same one the
              MN already has a mobility session set up with.
           </t>
         </section>

         <section title="Receiving LMA FQDN during the Network
           Access Authentication" anchor="dnsaaalma">
           <t>This solution is similar to the procedure described in
              <xref target="aaalma"/>. The difference is that the MAG
              receives a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the LMA
              instead of the IP address(es). The MAG has to query the
              DNS infrastructure in order to resolve the FQDN to the
              LMA IP address(es).
           </t>
           <t>The LMA FQDN might be a generic name for a PMIPv6 domain
              that resolves to one or more LMAs in the PMIPv6 domain.
              Alternatively the LMA FQDN might be resolved to
              exactly one LMA within the PMIPv6 domain. The latter
              approach would obviously be useful if a new target MAG
              after a handover should resolve the LMA FQDN to the LMA
              IP address where the MN mobility session is already
              located.
           </t>
           <t>The procedures described in this section and in <xref
              target="aaalma"/> may also be used together. For
              example, the AAA server might return a generic LMA FQDN
              during the MN initial attach and once the LMA
              gets selected, return the LMA IP address during the
              subsequent attachments to other MAGs in the PMIPv6 domain.
              In order for this to work, the resolved and selected LMA IP address
              must be updated to the remote Policy Store. For example, the LMA
              could perform the Policy Store update using the AAA infrastructure
              once it receives the initial PBU from the MAG for the new mobility
              session.

       <section title="Discovery Solutions based on Data from Lower Layers" anchor="lowsol">
         <t>The following section discusses solutions, where a MAG
            acquires information from layers below the IP layer.
            Based on this information, the MAG is able to determine which LMA
            to contact when the MN attaches to the MAG.
            The lower layers discussed here are not explicitly defined but
            include different radio access technologies and
            tunneling solutions such as IKEv2 <xref target="RFC4306"/>
            IPsec tunnel <xref target="RFC4303"/>.
         </t>

         <section title="Constructing the LMA FQDN from a Mobile Node Identity" anchor="lowid">
           <t>A MAG acquires a MN identity from lower layers. The
              MAG can use the information embedded in the identity to
              construct a generic LMA FQDN (based on some
              pre-configured formatting rules) and then proceed to
              resolve the LMA IP address(es) using the DNS. Obviously,
              the MN identity must embed information
              that can be used to uniquely identify
              the entity hosting and operating the LMA for the MN.
              Examples of such MN identities are the
              International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and
              Globally Unique Temporary User Equipment Identity (GUTI) <xref
              target="3GPP.23.003"/>. These MN identities contain
              information that can uniquely identify the operator where the
              subscription belongs to.
           </t>
         </section>

         <section title="Receiving LMA FQDN or IP Address from Lower Layers ">
           <t>The solution described here is similar to the solution
              discussed in <xref target="lowid"/>.
              A MAG receives a LMA FQDN or an
              IP address from lower layers, for example, as a part
              of the normal lower layer signaling when the MN attaches to the
              network. IKEv2 could be existing example of such lower layer signaling
              where IPsec is the "lower layer" for the MN <xref target="3GPP.24.302"/>.
              IKEv2 has an
              IKEv2 IDr payload, which is used by the IKEv2 initiator (i.e. the
              MN in this case) to specify which of the responder's identities (i.e.
              the LMA in this case) it wants to talk to. And here the responder
              identity could be an FQDN or an IP address of the LMA (as the
              IKEv2 identification payload can be an IP address or an FQDN).
              Another existing example is the Access Point Name Information
              Element (APN IE) in 3GPP radio's network access signaling 
              capable of carrying a FQDN <xref target="3GPP.24.008"/>. 
              However, in general this means the MN is also the originator of the
              LMA information. The LMA information content as such can
              be transparent to the MN, meaning the MN does not associate the
              information with any LMA function.
           </t>
         </section>

         <section title="Constructing the LMA FQDN from a Service Name">
           <t>
              Some network access technologies (including tunneling
              solutions) allow the MN to signal the service
              name that identifies a particular service or the
              external network it wants to access <xref target="3GPP.24.302"/>
              <xref target="RFC4306"/>. If the MN originated service name
              also embeds the information
              of the entity hosting the service or the hosting information can
              be derived from other information available at the same time
              (e.g., see <xref target="lowid"/>), then the MAG can construct a
              generic LMA FQDN (e.g., based on some pre-defined formatting rules)
              providing an access to the service or the external
              network. The pre-defined formatting rules <xref target="3GPP.23.003"/>
              are usually agreed on
              among operators that belong to the same inter-operator roaming
              consortium or by network infrastructure vendors defining an open
              networking system architecture.
           </t>
           <t>Once the MAG has the FQDN it can proceed to
              resolve the LMA IP address(es) using the DNS. An example
              of such service or external network name is the Access
              Point Name (APN) <xref target="3GPP.23.003"/> that
              contain information of the operator providing the access
              to the given service or the external network. For example, an
              FQDN for an "ims" APN could be "ims.apn.epc.mnc015.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org".
           </t>

       </section>

       <section title="Handover Considerations" anchor="hocon">
         <t>
         Whenever a MN moves and attaches to a new MAG in a
         PMIPv6 domain, all the MAGs that the MN attaches to,
         should use the same LMA. If there is only one LMA per PMIPv6
         domain, then there is no issue. If there is a context
         transfer mechanism available between the MAGs, then the new
         MAG knows the LMA information from the old MAG. Such a
         mechanism is described in <xref
         target="I-D.ietf-mipshop-pfmipv6"/>. If the MN
         related context is not transferred between the MAGs, then a
         mechanism to deliver the current LMA information to the new
         MAG is required.
         </t>
         <t>Relying on DNS during handovers
         is not generally a working solution if the PMIPv6 domain has more than
         one LMA, unless the DNS consistently assigns a specific LMA for
         each given MN. In most cases described in <xref target="lowsol"/>,
         where the MAG derives the LMA FQDN,
         there is no prior knowledge whether the LMA FQDN resolves to
         one or more LMA IP address(es) in the PMIPv6 domain. However, 
         depending on the deployment and deployment related regulation 
         (such as inter-operator roaming consortium agreements) the situation
         might not be this desperate. For example, a MAG might be able to
         synthesize a LMA specific FQDN (e.g. out
         of MN identity or some other service specific parameters). 
         Alternatively, the MAG could use (for example), a MN identity as an input to an
         algorithm that deterministically assigns the same LMA out of a pool of
         LMAs (assuming the MAG has e.g. learned a group of LMA FQDNs via
         SRV <xref target="RFC2782"/> query). These approaches would
         guarantee that DNS returns always the same LMA Address to the MAG.
         </t>
         <t>
         Once the MN completes its initial attachment to a
         PMIPv6 domain, the information about the LMA that is selected
         to serve the MN is stored in the Policy Store (or
         the AAA server).  The LMA information is conveyed to the
         policy store by the LMA after the initial attachment is
         completed <xref target="RFC5779"/>. Typically
         AAA infrastructure is used for exchanging information between the
         LMA and the Policy Store.
         </t>
         <t>
         When the MN moves and attaches to another MAG in the
         PMIPv6 domain, then the AAA servers delivers the existing LMA
         information to the new MAG as part of the authentication and
         authorization procedure as described in <xref
         target="aaalma"/>

       <section title="Recommendations">
       <t>This document discussed several solution approaches for a dynamic LMA
       discovery. All discussed solution approaches actually require additional
       functionality or infrastructure support that the base PMIPv6
        <xref target="RFC5213"/> does not require.
       </t>
       <t>Solutions in <xref target="lowsol"/> all depend on lower layers being
       able to provide information that a MAG can then use to query DNS and
       discover a suitable LMA.  The capabilities of the lower layers and
       the interactions with them are generally out of scope of IETF, and
       specific to a certain system and architecture.
       </t>
       <t>
       Solutions in  <xref target="aaasol"/> depend on the existence of an AAA
       infrastructure, which is able to provide a MAG either a LMA IP
       address or a LMA FQDN.  While there can be system and architecture
       specific details regarding the AAA interactions and the use of DNS, the
       dynamic LMA discovery can be entirely implemented using protocols and
       technologies developed in IETF.  Therefore, using AAA based LMA
       discovery solutions are recommended by this document.

         <t>
            The use of DNS for obtaining the IP address of a mobility
            agent carries certain security risks. These are explained
            in detail in Section 9.1 of <xref target="RFC5026"/>. However,
            the risks described in <xref target="RFC5026"/>
            are mitigated to a large extent in this document,
            since the MAG and the LMA belong to the same PMIPv6
            domain. The DNS server that the MAG queries is
            also part of the same PMIPv6 domain. Even if
            the MAG obtains the IP address of a bogus LMA from a bogus
            DNS server, further harm is prevented since the MAG and
            the LMA should authenticate each other before exchanging
            PMIPv6 signaling messages.  <xref target="RFC5213"/> specifies the
            use of IKEv2 between the
            MAG and the LMA to authenticate each other and setup IPsec
            security associations for protecting the PMIPv6
            signaling messages.

         <t>
            The AAA infrastructure may be used to transport the LMA
            discovery related information between the MAG and the AAA
            server via one or more AAA brokers and/or AAA proxies.
            In this case the MAG to the AAA server
            communication relies on the security properties of the
            intermediate AAA brokers and AAA proxies.

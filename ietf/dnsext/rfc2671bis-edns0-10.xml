        The Domain Name System's wire protocol includes a number of fixed
        fields whose range has been or soon will be exhausted and does not
        allow requestors to advertise their capabilities to responders. This
        document describes backward compatible mechanisms for allowing the
        protocol to grow.

        This document updates the EDNS(0) specification (and obsoletes RFC 2671)
				based on feedback from deployment experience in several implementations.
				It also obsoletes RFC 2673 ("Binary Labels in the Domain Name System") and
				adds considerations on the use of extended labels in the DNS.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        DNS <xref target="RFC1035"/> specifies a Message Format and within such
        messages there are standard formats for encoding options, errors, and
        name compression. The maximum allowable size of a DNS Message over UDP
        not using the extensions described in this document is limited to
        512 bytes. Many of DNS's protocol limits, such as the maximum message
        size over UDP, are too small to efficiently support the additional
				information that can be conveyed in the DNS (e.g. several IPv6 addresses or
				DNSSEC signatures). Finally, RFC 1035 does not
				define any way for implementations to advertise their capabilities
				to any of the other actors they interact with.
        </t>
        <t>
        <xref target="RFC2671"/> added an extension mechanism to DNS. This mechanism
    	is widely supported and a number of new DNS uses and protocol
    	extensions depend on the presence of these extensions. This
    	memo refines that specification and obsoletes <xref target="RFC2671"/>.
        </t>
      <t>
        Unextended agents will not know how to interpret the protocol
        extensions defined in <xref target="RFC2671"/> and restated here.
        Extended agents need to be prepared for handling the interactions with
        unextended clients in the face of new protocol elements, and fall
        back gracefully to unextended DNS.
      </t>
			<t>EDNS is a hop-by-hop extension to DNS. This means the use of EDNS is
				negotiated between each pair of hosts in a DNS resolution process.
				For instance the stub resolver communicating with the recursive resolver
				or the recursive resolver communicating with an authoritative server.
			</t>
      <t>
        <xref target="RFC2671"/> specified extended label types. The only such label
        proposed was in <xref target="RFC2673"/> for a label type called "Bitstring Labels."
        For various reasons introducing a new label type was found to be
        extremely difficult, and <xref target="RFC2673"/> was moved to Experimental.
        This document deprecates Extended Labels, and therefore Binary Labels,
        obsoleting <xref target="RFC2673"/>.
			</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>
        "Requestor" is the side which sends a request.  "Responder" is
        an authoritative, recursive resolver, or other DNS component which
        responds to questions. Other terminology is used as per its use in
        the references.
			</t>
      <t>
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in
        <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.
			</t>
    </section>
    <section title="EDNS Support Requirement">
      <t>
				EDNS provides a mechanism to improve the scalability of DNS as its uses get more diverse on the
        Internet. It does this by enabling the use of UDP transport for DNS messages with sizes beyond the
        limits specified in RFC 1035 as well as providing extra data space for additional flags and return
        codes (RCODEs).
				However, implementation experiencing indicates that adding new RCODEs should be avoided due to the
				difficulty in upgrading the installed base.
				Flags SHOULD be used only when necessary for DNS resolution to
				function.
			</t>
			<t>For many uses, a EDNS Option Code may be preferred.
			</t>
			<t>
				With time, some applications of DNS have made EDNS a requirement for their deployment. For
        instance, DNSSEC uses the additional flag space introduced in EDNS to signal the request to include
        DNSSEC data in a DNS response.
			</t>
			<t>
				Given the increase in DNS response sizes when including larger data items such as AAAA Records,
        DNSSEC information (e.g. RRSIG or DNSKEY) or large TXT Records, the additional UDP payload
        capabilities provided by EDNS can help improve the scalability of the DNS by avoiding widespread
        use of TCP for DNS transport.
			</t>
    </section>
    <section title="DNS Message changes">
      <section title="Message Header">
        <t>
          The DNS Message Header's second full 16-bit word is divided into a
          4-bit OPCODE, a 4-bit RCODE, and a number of 1-bit flags
          (see <xref target="RFC1035">, section
          4.1.1</xref>). Some of these were marked for
          future use, and most these have since been allocated. Also, most of
          the RCODE values are now in use. The OPT pseudo-RR specified below
          contains extensions to the RCODE bit field as well as additional flag bits.

        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Label Types">
        <t>
          The first two bits of a wire format domain label are used to denote the
          type of the label.
          <xref target="RFC1035"/> allocates two of the four
          possible types and reserves the other two.
          More label types were defined in <xref target="RFC2671"/>. This document
          obsoletes the use of the 2-bit combination defined by <xref target="RFC2671"/>
          to identify extended label types.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="UDP Message Size">
        <t>
          Traditional DNS Messages are limited to 512 octets in size when sent
          over UDP <xref target="RFC1035"/>. Fitting the increasing
          amounts of data that can be transported in DNS in this 512-byte limit
					is becoming more difficult.
          For instance, inclusion of DNSSEC records frequently requires a much
          larger response than a 512 byte message can hold.
        </t>
        <t>
			EDNS(0) is intended to provide support for transporting these larger packet sizes while continuing to use UDP. It specifies
      a way to advertise additional features such as larger response size capability, which is intended to help avoid truncated
      UDP responses which then cause retry over TCP.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Extended Label Types">
      <t>
        The first octet in the on-the-wire representation of a DNS label
        specifies the label type; the basic DNS specification
        <xref target="RFC1035"/>
        dedicates the two most significant bits of that octet for this purpose.
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref target="RFC2671"/> defined DNS label type 0b01 for use as an
        indication for Extended Label Types. A specific Extended Label Type
        was selected by the 6 least significant bits of the first octet. Thus,
        Extended Label Types were indicated by the values 64-127 (0b01xxxxxx)
        in the first octet of the label.
      </t>
      <t>
        Extended Label Types are extremely difficult to deploy due to lack of support in
        clients and intermediate gateways as described in <xref target="RFC3363"/>
        which moved <xref target="RFC2673"/> to experimental status, and <xref target="RFC3364"/>,
        which describes the pros and cons. As such proposals that contemplate extended labels SHOULD
 				weigh this deployment cost against the possibility of implementing functionality in other ways.
        </t>
			<t>
        Finally, implementations MUST NOT generate or pass Binary Labels in their communications as
				they are now deprecated.

    <section title="The OPT pseudo-RR">
      <section title="OPT Record Definition">
        <section title="Basic elements">
        <t>
          An OPT pseudo-RR (sometimes called a meta-RR) MAY be added to the
          additional data section of a request.
        </t>
        <t>
          The OPT RR has RR type 41.
        </t>
        <t>
          If present in requests, compliant responders MUST include an OPT record
          in their respective responses.
        </t>
        <t>
          An OPT record does not carry any DNS data. It is used only to contain
          control information pertaining to the question and answer sequence of
          a specific transaction. OPT RRs MUST NOT be cached, forwarded, or
          stored in or loaded from master files.
        </t>
        <t>
          The OPT RR MAY be placed anywhere within the additional data section.
          When an OPT RR MUST is included within any DNS message only ONE OPT RR can be present.
					If a query message
          with more than one OPT RR is received, a FORMERR (RCODE=1) MUST be returned.
          The placement flexibility for the OPT RR does not override the need
          for the TSIG or SIG(0) RRs to be the last in the additional section
          whenever they are present.
        </t>
      </section>
        <section title="Wire Format">
        <t>
          An OPT RR has a fixed part and a variable set of options expressed as
          {attribute, value} pairs. The fixed part holds some DNS meta data and
          also a small collection of basic extension elements which we expect
          to be so popular that it would be a waste of wire space to encode
          them as {attribute, value} pairs.
        </t>
        <t>
          The fixed part of an OPT RR is structured as follows:

          is required, no fallback should be performed as they are only
          signalled through EDNS.
          If an implementation detects that some servers for the zone support
          EDNS(0) while others would force the use of TCP to fetch all data,

        <t>
          The requestor's UDP payload size (encoded in the RR CLASS
          field) is the number of octets of the largest UDP payload
					that can be
          reassembled and delivered in the requestor's network stack.
          Note that path MTU, with or without fragmentation, could be smaller
          than this.
				</t>
				<t>
					Values lower than 512 MUST be treated as equal to 512.
        </t>
        <t>
        	The requestor SHOULD place a value in this field that it can actually receive. For example, if a requestor sits behind
          a firewall which will block fragmented IP packets, a requestor SHOULD NOT choose a value which will cause
          fragmentation. Doing so will prevent large responses from being received, and can cause fallback to occur. This
          knowledge may be auto-detected by the implementation or provided by a human administrator.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that a 512-octet UDP payload requires a 576-octet IP reassembly
          buffer.  Choosing between 1280 and 1410 bytes for IP (v4 or v6) over Ethernet
          would be reasonable.</t>
				<t>
					Bigger values SHOULD be considered by implementers to be used where fragmentation
					is not a concern. Implementations
					SHOULD use their largest configured or implemented values as a starting point
					in an EDNS transaction in the absence of previous knowledge about the destination server.
				</t>
				<t>
          Choosing a very large value will guarantee fragmentation at the IP

          The requestor's maximum payload size can change over time. It
          MUST NOT be cached for use beyond the transaction in which it
          is advertised.

        <section title="Responder's Payload Size">
        <t>
          The responder's maximum payload size can change over time, but can
          be reasonably expected to remain constant between two closely spaced sequential
          transactions;  for example, an arbitrary QUERY used as a probe to discover a
          responder's maximum UDP payload size, followed immediately by an
          UPDATE which takes advantage of this size.  This is considered
          preferable to the outright use of TCP for oversized requests, if
          there is any reason to suspect that the responder implements
          EDNS, and if a request will not fit in the default 512 payload size
          limit.
        </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Payload Size Selection">
        <t>
          Due to transaction overhead, it is not recommended to advertise an architectural limit as a maximum UDP payload size.
          Even on system stacks capable of reassembling 64KB datagrams, memory usage at low levels in the system will be a
          concern. A good compromise may be the use of a EDNS maximum payload size of 4096 octets as a starting point.
        </t>
        <t>
          A requestor MAY choose to implement a fallback to smaller advertised
          sizes to work around firewall or other network limitations.
          A requestor SHOULD choose to use a fallback mechanism which begins
          with a large size, such as 4096.  If that fails, a fallback around
          the 1280-1410 byte range SHOULD be tried, as it has a reasonable chance
          to fit within a single Ethernet frame.  Failing that, a requestor MAY
          choose a 512 byte packet, which with large answers may cause a TCP
          retry.

					Values of less than 512 bytes MUST be treated as equal to 512 bytes.

        <t>
					In a network that carries DNS traffic there could be active equipment other than that participating directly in the DNS
          resolution process (stub and caching resolvers, authoritative servers) that affect the transmission of DNS messages
          (e.g. firewalls, load balancers, proxies, etc) referred to here as MiddleBoxes.

					Conformant MiddleBoxes MUST NOT limit DNS messages over UDP to 512 bytes.

				  answering queries or acting as intelligent forwarders,

        The presence of an OPT pseudo-RR in a request should be taken as an
        indication that the requestor fully implements the given version of EDNS,
        and can correctly understand any response that conforms to that
        feature's specification.
      </t>
      <t>
        Lack of presence of an OPT record in a request MUST be taken as an
        indication that the requestor does not implement any part of this
        specification and that the responder MUST NOT include an OPT record in
        its response.
      </t>
      <t>
				Extended agents MUST be prepared for handling the interactions with
      	unextended clients in the face of new protocol elements, and fall
      	back gracefully to unextended DNS when needed.
			</t>
      <t>
        Responders which choose not to implement the protocol extensions defined in this document MUST respond with a return
        code (RCODE) of FORMERR to messages containing an OPT RR in the additional section and MUST NOT include an OPT record in
        the response.
      </t>
      <t>
        If there is a problem with processing the OPT record itself, such as an
        option value that is badly formatted or includes out of range values, a
        FORMERR MUST be returned.  If this occurs the response MUST include an
        OPT record.  This is intended to allow the requestor to distinguish
        between servers which do not implement EDNS and format errors within
        EDNS.
      </t>
      <t>
      	The minimal response MUST be the DNS header, question section, and an OPT record. This MUST also occur when an truncated
        response (using the DNS header's TC bit) is returned.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        Requestor-side specification of the maximum buffer size may open a
        DNS denial of service attack if responders can be made to send
        messages which are too large for intermediate gateways to forward,
        thus leading to potential ICMP storms between gateways and responders.
      </t>
      <t>
        Announcing very large UDP buffer sizes may result in dropping by
        middleboxes (see <xref target="middleboxes"/>).  This could cause retransmissions
        with no hope of success.
        Some devices have been found to reject fragmented UDP packets.
      </t>
      <t>
        Announcing too small UDP buffer sizes may result in fallback to TCP with
        a corresponding load impact on DNS servers.
        This is especially important with DNSSEC, where answers are much larger.

<section title="Introduction">
	<t> 
	DNAME is a DNS Resource Record type originally defined in 
	RFC 2672 <xref target="RFC2672" />. DNAME provides redirection from
	a part of the DNS name tree to another part of the DNS name tree. 
	</t><t>
	The DNAME RR and the CNAME RR <xref target="RFC1034"/> cause a 
	lookup to (potentially) return data corresponding to a domain name 
	different from the queried domain name.  The difference between 
	the two resource records is that the CNAME RR directs the lookup 
	of data at its owner to another single name, a DNAME RR directs 
	lookups for data at descendants of its owner's name to
	corresponding names under a different (single) node of the tree. 
	</t><t>
	Take for example, looking through a zone (see 
	<xref target="RFC1034">RFC 1034</xref>, section 4.3.2, step 3) for 
	the domain name "foo.example.com" and a DNAME resource record
	is found at "example.com" indicating that all queries under 
	"example.com" be directed to "example.net".  The lookup process 
	will return to step 1 with the new query name of "foo.example.net".  
	Had the query name been "www.foo.example.com" the new query name 
	would be "www.foo.example.net".
	</t><t>
	This document is a revision of the original specification of DNAME
	in <xref target="RFC2672">RFC 2672</xref>.  
	DNAME was conceived to help with the problem of maintaining 
	address-to-name mappings in a context of network renumbering.  
	With a careful set-up, a renumbering event in the network 
	causes no change to the authoritative server that has the 
	address-to-name mappings.  Examples in practice are classless 
	reverse address space delegations.
	</t><t>
	Another usage of DNAME lies in aliasing of name spaces. For 
	example, a zone administrator may want sub-trees of the DNS to 
	contain the same information.  Examples include punycode  <xref target="RFC3492" /> alternates for 
	domain spaces.  
	</t><t>
	This revision of the DNAME specification does not change the wire format or the 
	handling of DNAME Resource Records.
	Discussion is added on problems that may be encountered 
	when using DNAME.
	</t>
</section>
<section title="The DNAME Resource Record">
<section title="Format">
	<t>
	The DNAME RR has mnemonic DNAME and type code 39 (decimal).
	It is CLASS-insensitive.
	</t><t>
	<figure title="">
  	<preamble>
	Its RDATA is comprised of a single field, &lt;target>, which 
	contains a fully qualified domain name that MUST be sent in 
	uncompressed form <xref target="RFC1035" />, <xref target="RFC3597" />.
	The &lt;target> field MUST be present.
	The presentation format of &lt;target> is that of a domain 
	name <xref target="RFC1035" />.

  	<artwork>
        &lt;owner> &lt;ttl> &lt;class> DNAME &lt;target>
  	</artwork>
  	<postamble>The effect of the DNAME RR is the substitution of the record's
	&lt;target> for its owner name, as a suffix of a domain name. This substitution
	is to be applied for all names below the owner name of the DNAME RR.
	This substitution has to be applied for every DNAME RR found in the
	resolution process, which allows fairly lengthy valid chains of DNAME
	RRs.
  	</postamble>
	</figure>
	</t><t>
	Details of the substitution process, methods to avoid conflicting
	resource records, and rules for specific corner cases are given in
	the following subsections.
	</t>
</section>
<section title="The DNAME Substitution">
	<t>
	When following RFC 1034 <xref target="RFC1034"/>, section 4.3.2's 
	algorithm's third step, "start matching down, label by label, in 
	the zone" and a node is found to own a DNAME resource record 
	a DNAME substitution occurs.  The name being sought may be the 
	original query name or a name that is the result of a CNAME 
	resource record being followed or a previously encountered DNAME.  
	As in the case when finding a CNAME resource record or NS resource 
	record set, the processing of a DNAME will happen prior to finding 
	the desired domain name.
	</t><t>
	A DNAME substitution is performed by replacing the suffix labels 
	of the name being sought matching the owner name of the DNAME 
	resource record with the string of labels in the RDATA field.  
	The matching labels end with the root label in all cases. 
	Only whole labels are replaced. See the table of examples for 
	common cases and corner cases.
	</t><t>
	<figure title="Table 1. DNAME Substitution Examples.">
  	<preamble>
	In the table below, the QNAME refers to the query name. The 
	owner is the DNAME owner domain name, and the target refers to 
	the target of the DNAME record. The result is the resulting name
	after performing the DNAME substitution on the query name.
	"no match" means that the query did not match the DNAME and thus
	no substitution is performed and a possible error message is returned
	(if no other result is possible).
	Thus every line contains one example substitution.
	In the examples below, 'cyc' and 'shortloop' contain loops.

	</t><t>
	It is possible for DNAMEs to form loops, just as
	CNAMEs can form loops. DNAMEs and CNAMEs can chain together to
	form loops. A single corner case DNAME can form a loop. Resolvers
	and servers should be cautious in devoting resources to a query,
	but be aware that fairly long chains of DNAMEs may be valid.  
	Zone content administrators should take care to insure that there
	are no loops that could occur when using DNAME or DNAME/CNAME 
	redirection.
	</t><t>
	The domain name can get too long during substitution. For example, suppose the
	target name of the DNAME RR is 250 octets in length (multiple labels), if 
	an incoming QNAME that has a first label over 5 octets in length, the result 
	would be a name over 255 octets.  If this occurs the 
	server returns an RCODE of YXDOMAIN <xref target="RFC2136" />. The DNAME
	record and its signature (if the zone is signed) are included in the answer as proof 
	for the YXDOMAIN (value 6) RCODE.
	</t>
</section>
<section title="DNAME Owner Name Matching the QNAME">
<t>
	Unlike a CNAME RR, a DNAME RR redirects DNS names subordinate to its
	owner name; the owner name of a DNAME is not redirected itself.
	The domain name that owns a DNAME record is allowed to have other
	resource record types at that domain name, except DNAMEs, CNAMEs
	or other types that have restrictions on what they can co-exist with.
	When there is a match of the QTYPE to a type (or types) also owned by 
	the owner name the response is sourced from the owner name.  E.g., a
	QTYPE of ANY would return the (available) types at the owner name, not 
	the target name.
</t><t>	
	DNAME RRs MUST NOT appear at the same owner name as an NS RR unless
	the owner name is the zone apex as this would constitute data below a
	zone cut.
</t><t>
       If a DNAME record is present at the zone apex, there is still a need
       to have the customary SOA and NS resource records there as well. Such
       a DNAME cannot be used to mirror a zone completely, as it does not
       mirror the zone apex.
</t><t>
	These rules also allow DNAME records to be queried through RFC 1034
	<xref target="RFC1034" /> compliant, DNAME-unaware caches.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Names Next to and Below a DNAME Record">
	<t>
	Resource records MUST NOT exist at any sub-domain of 
	the owner of a DNAME RR.  To get the contents for names 
	subordinate to that owner name, the DNAME redirection must be invoked 
	and the resulting target queried.  A server MAY refuse to load 
	a zone that has data at a sub-domain of a domain name 
	owning a DNAME RR.  If the server does load the zone, those names
	below the DNAME RR will be occluded as described in 
	RFC 2136 <xref target="RFC2136"/>, section 7.18.  
	Also a server ought to refuse to load
	a zone subordinate to the owner of a DNAME record in the ancestor zone.
	See <xref target="dynamic" /> for further discussion 
	related to dynamic update.
	</t><t>
	DNAME is a singleton type, meaning only one DNAME is allowed per 
	name.  The owner name of a DNAME can only have one DNAME RR, and 
	no CNAME RRs can exist at that name. 
	These rules make sure that for a single domain name only one 
	redirection exists, and thus no confusion which one to follow.
	A server ought to refuse to load a zone that violates these rules.
	</t>
</section>
<section title="Compression of the DNAME record.">
	<t>
	The DNAME owner name can be compressed like any other owner name. 
	The DNAME RDATA target name MUST NOT be sent out in 
	compressed form and MUST be downcased for DNSSEC validation.
	</t><t>
	Although the previous DNAME specification <xref target="RFC2672" /> 
	(that is obsoleted by this specification) talked about signaling 
	to allow compression of the target name, such signaling has never
	been specified and this document also does not specify this signaling 
	behavior.
	</t><t> 
	RFC 2672 (obsoleted by this document) stated that the EDNS version 
	had a meaning for understanding of DNAME and DNAME target name 
	compression. This document revises RFC 2672, in that there is no 
	EDNS version signaling for DNAME. </t>

<section title="Processing">
	<section title="CNAME synthesis" anchor="cnamesynth">
	<t>
	When preparing a response, a server performing a DNAME
	substitution will in all cases include the relevant DNAME RR in the 
	answer section. Relevant cases includes the following:
    	<list style="numbers">
    	<t>The DNAME is being employed as a substitution instruction.</t>
    	<t>The DNAME itself matches the QTYPE and the owner name matches QNAME.</t>
    	</list></t>
    	<t>
        When the owner name name matches the QNAME and the QTYPE matches another 
	type owned there, the DNAME is not included in the answer.
	</t><t>
	A CNAME RR with TTL equal to the corresponding DNAME RR is synthesized
	and included in the answer section when the DNAME is employed as a 
	substitution instruction.  The owner name of the CNAME is the QNAME
	of the query. The DNSSEC specification <xref target="RFC4033" />, <xref target="RFC4034" />, 
	<xref target="RFC4035" /> says that the 
	synthesized CNAME does not have to be signed.  The signed DNAME has an RRSIG 
	and a validating resolver can check the CNAME against the DNAME 
	record and validate the signature over the DNAME RR. 
	</t>
	<t>
	Servers MUST be able to answer a query for a synthesized CNAME. Like
	other query types this invokes the DNAME, and then the server synthesizes the CNAME 
	and places it into the answer section. If the server in question is a cache, the synthesized
	CNAME's TTL SHOULD be equal to the decremented TTL of the cached DNAME.
	</t>
	<t>
	Resolvers MUST be able to handle a synthesized CNAME TTL of zero or
	equal to the TTL of the corresponding DNAME record (as some older
	authoritative server implementations set the TTL of synthesized 
	CNAMEs to zero). A TTL of zero
	means that the CNAME can be discarded immediately after processing
	the answer.
	</t>
	</section>

	<section title="Server algorithm">
	<t>
	Below is the server algorithm, which appeared in RFC 2672 Section 4.1. 
	</t>
	<t>
	<list style='numbers'>
	<t> <!-- step 1 -->
	Set or clear the value of recursion available in the response
      	depending on whether the name server is willing to provide
      	recursive service.  If recursive service is available and
      	requested via the RD bit in the query, go to step 5, otherwise
      	step 2.
	<vspace blankLines='1' />
	</t>
	<t> <!-- step 2 -->
	 Search the available zones for the zone which is the nearest
      	ancestor to QNAME.  If such a zone is found, go to step 3,
      	otherwise step 4.
	<vspace blankLines='1' />
	</t>
	<t> <!-- step 3 -->
   	Start matching down, label by label, in the zone.  The matching
      	process can terminate several ways:
	<vspace blankLines='1' />
	<list style="letters">
	<t>
      	If the whole of QNAME is matched, we have found the node.
      	<vspace blankLines='1' />

         If the data at the node is a CNAME, and QTYPE does not match
         CNAME, copy the CNAME RR into the answer section of the
         response, change QNAME to the canonical name in the CNAME RR,
         and go back to step 1.
      	<vspace blankLines='1' />

         Otherwise, copy all RRs which match QTYPE into the answer
         section and go to step 6.
	<vspace blankLines='1' />
	</t>

	<t>
      If a match would take us out of the authoritative data, we have
         a referral.  This happens when we encounter a node with NS RRs
         marking cuts along the bottom of a zone.
      <vspace blankLines='1' />

         Copy the NS RRs for the sub-zone into the authority section of
         the reply.  Put whatever addresses are available into the
         additional section, using glue RRs if the addresses are not
         available from authoritative data or the cache.  Go to step 4.
	<vspace blankLines='1' />
	</t>

	<t>
      If at some label, a match is impossible (i.e., the
         corresponding label does not exist), look to see whether the
         last label matched has a DNAME record.
      <vspace blankLines='1' />

         If a DNAME record exists at that point, copy that record into
         the answer section.  If substitution of its &lt;target> for its
         &lt;owner> in QNAME would overflow the legal size for a &lt;domain-
         name>, set RCODE to YXDOMAIN <xref target="RFC2136" /> and exit; 
	 otherwise
         perform the substitution and continue.  
         The server MUST synthesize a CNAME 
	 record as described above and include it in the answer section.
	 Go back to step 1.
      <vspace blankLines='1' />

         If there was no DNAME record, look to see if the "*" label
         exists.
      <vspace blankLines='1' />

         If the "*" label does not exist, check whether the name we are
         looking for is the original QNAME in the query or a name we
         have followed due to a CNAME or DNAME.  If the name is original, set an
         authoritative name error in the response and exit.  Otherwise
         just exit.
      <vspace blankLines='1' />

	      If the "*" label does exist, match RRs at that node against
	      QTYPE.  If any match, copy them into the answer section, but
	      set the owner of the RR to be QNAME, and not the node with
	      the "*" label.  If the data at the node with the "*" label is a CNAME,
  	    and QTYPE doesn't match CNAME, copy the CNAME RR into the answer
  	    section of the response changing the owner name to the QNAME,
  	    change QNAME to the canonical name in the CNAME RR, and go back to
  	    step 1. Otherwise, Go to step 6.
	<vspace blankLines='1' />
	</t>
	</list>
	</t>

	<t> <!-- step 4 -->
   	Start matching down in the cache.  If QNAME is found in the cache,
   	copy all RRs attached to it that match QTYPE into the answer
      	section.  If QNAME is not found in the cache but a DNAME record is
      	present at an ancestor of QNAME, copy that DNAME record into the
      	answer section.  If there was no delegation from authoritative
      	data, look for the best one from the cache, and put it in the
      	authority section.  Go to step 6.
	<vspace blankLines='1' />
	</t>

	<t> <!-- step 5 -->
   	Use the local resolver or a copy of its algorithm 
   	to answer the query.  Store the results,
      	including any intermediate CNAMEs and DNAMEs, in the answer
      	section of the response.
	<vspace blankLines='1' />
	</t>

	<t> <!-- step 6 -->
	   Using local data only, attempt to add other RRs which may be
	      useful to the additional section of the query.  Exit.
	</t>
	</list></t>

	<t>
	   Note that there will be at most one ancestor with a DNAME as
	   described in step 4 unless some zone's data is in violation of the
	   no-descendants limitation in section 3.  An implementation might take
	   advantage of this limitation by stopping the search of step 3c or
	   step 4 when a DNAME record is encountered.
	</t>

	</section>
	<section title="Wildcards">
	<t>
	The use of DNAME in conjunction with wildcards is discouraged
	<xref target="RFC4592" />.  Thus records of the form
	"*.example.com DNAME example.net" SHOULD NOT be used. 
	</t><t>
	The interaction between the expansion of the wildcard and the 
	redirection of the DNAME is non-deterministic.
	Because the processing is non-deterministic, DNSSEC validating 
	resolvers may not be able to validate a wildcarded DNAME.
	</t><t>
	A server MAY give a warning that the behavior is unspecified
	if such a wildcarded DNAME is loaded.  The server MAY refuse it,
	refuse to load the zone or refuse dynamic updates.
	</t>
	</section>

	<section title="Acceptance and Intermediate Storage">
		<t>
		Recursive caching name servers can encounter data at names below the owner name of a
		DNAME RR, due to a change at the authoritative server where data from
		before and after the change resides in the cache. This conflict 
		situation is a transitional phase that ends when the old data
		times out. The caching name server can opt to store both old and new data and 
		treat each as if the other did not exist, or drop the old data, or 
		drop the longer domain name. In any approach, consistency returns 
		after the older data TTL times out.
		</t><t>
		Recursive caching name servers MUST perform CNAME synthesis on behalf of
		clients. </t>
		<t>
		If a recursive caching name server encounters a DNSSEC validated DNAME RR which
  	contradicts information already in the cache (excluding CNAME
  	records), it SHOULD cache the DNAME RR, but it MAY cache the
  	CNAME record received along with it, subject to the rules for CNAME. If the 
	DNAME RR cannot be validated via DNSSEC (i.e. not BOGUS, but not able to validate), the recursive caching server SHOULD
	NOT cache the DNAME RR but MAY cache the CNAME record received along with it, 
	subject to the rules of CNAME.
		</t>
			<section title="Resolver Algorithm">
			<t>
			A resolver algorithm likewise changes to handle DNAME processing. 
			The complete algorithm becomes:

<section title="DNAME Discussions in Other Documents">
	<t>In <xref target="RFC2181" />, in Section 10.3., the discussion
	on MX and NS records touches on redirection by CNAMEs, but this
	also holds for DNAMEs.
	</t><t>
	<figure><preamble> Excerpt from 10.3. MX and NS records 
	(in RFC 2181). </preamble>
<artwork>
        The domain name used as the value of a NS resource record, 
        or part of the value of a MX resource record must not be 
        an alias.  Not only is the specification clear on this 
        point, but using an alias in either of these positions 
        neither works as well as might be hoped, nor well fulfills 
        the ambition that may have led to this approach.  This 
        domain name must have as its value one or more address 
        records.  Currently those will be A records, however in 
        the future other record types giving addressing 
        information may be acceptable.  It can also have other 
        RRs, but never a CNAME RR.</artwork>

	<t> 
	The DNAME RR is discussed in RFC 3363, section 4, on A6 and DNAME.
	The opening premise of this section is demonstrably wrong, and so 
	the conclusion based on that premise is wrong.  In particular, 
	<xref target="RFC3363" /> deprecates the use of DNAME in the IPv6 
	reverse tree, which is then carried forward as a recommendation in 
	<xref target="RFC4294" />.  Based on the experience gained in the 
	meantime, <xref target="RFC3363" /> is revised, dropping all 
	constraints on having DNAME RRs in these zones.  This would greatly 
	improve the manageability of the IPv6 reverse tree.  These changes 
	are made explicit below.
	</t>
	<t>
	<figure><preamble>In <xref target="RFC3363" />, the paragraph</preamble>
<artwork>
  "The issues for DNAME in the reverse mapping tree appears to be
  closely tied to the need to use fragmented A6 in the main tree: if
  one is necessary, so is the other, and if one isn't necessary, the
  other isn't either.  Therefore, in moving RFC 2874 to experimental,
  the intent of this document is that use of DNAME RRs in the reverse
  tree be deprecated."
        </artwork>
	<postamble>is updated by this document and the use of DNAME RRs in the reverse tree 
	is no longer deprecated.</postamble>

	</t>

	<t>
	<figure><preamble>
        In <xref target="RFC4294" />, the reference to DNAME was left in as an
        editorial oversight.  The paragraph </preamble>

	</t>
  </section>
<section title="Other Issues with DNAME">
	<t>
	There are several issues to be aware of about the use of DNAME.
	</t>

<section title="Canonical hostnames cannot be below DNAME owners">
	<t>
	The names listed as target names of MX, NS, PTR and SRV
	<xref target="RFC2782" /> records must
	be canonical hostnames. This means no CNAME or DNAME redirection
	may be present during DNS lookup of the address records for the host.
	This is discussed in RFC 2181 <xref target="RFC2181" />, 
	section 10.3, and RFC 1912 <xref target="RFC1912" />, section 2.4.
	For SRV see RFC 2782 <xref target="RFC2782" /> page 4.
	</t><t>
	The upshot of this is that although the lookup of a PTR record can
	involve DNAMEs, the name listed in the PTR record can not fall under
	a DNAME.  The same holds for NS, SRV and MX records.  For example, 
	when punycode <xref target="RFC3492" /> alternates for a zone use DNAME then the 
	NS, MX, SRV and PTR records that point to that zone must use names 
	that are not aliases in their RDATA.
	What must be done then is to have the domain names with DNAME 
	substitution already applied to it as the MX, NS, PTR, SRV data.
	These are valid canonical hostnames.
	</t>
</section>
<section title="Dynamic Update and DNAME" anchor="dynamic">
	<t>
	DNAME records can be added, changed and removed in a zone using
	dynamic update transactions.  Adding a DNAME RR to a zone occludes
	any domain names that may exist under the added DNAME.  
	</t>
	<t>
	If a dynamic update message attempts to add a DNAME with a given
	owner name but a CNAME is 
	associated with that name, then the server MUST ignore the DNAME. If a
	DNAME is already associated with that name, then it is replaced with the new DNAME.
	Otherwise, add the DNAME. If a CNAME is added with a given owner name but a DNAME is associated
	with that name, then the CNAME MUST be ignored.  This is similar behavior 
	for dynamic updates to an owner name of a CNAME RR <xref target="RFC2136" />.
	</t>
</section>
<section title="DNSSEC and DNAME">
	<t>
	The following subsections specify the behavior of implementations that understand both DNSSEC and DNAME (synthesis). 
	</t>
<section title="Signed DNAME, Unsigned Synthesized CNAME">
	<t>
	In any response, a signed DNAME RR indicates a non-terminal
	redirection of the query.  There might or might not be a server
	synthesized CNAME in the answer section; if there is, the CNAME
	will never be signed.  For a DNSSEC validator, verification
	of the DNAME RR and then checking that the CNAME was properly
	synthesized is sufficient proof.  
	</t>
</section>
<section title="DNAME Bit in NSEC Type Map">
	<t>
	In any negative response, the NSEC or NSEC3 <xref target="RFC5155" /> 
	record type bit map SHOULD be checked to see that there was no
	DNAME that could have been applied.  If the DNAME bit in the type
	bit map is set and the query name is a sub-domain of the closest
	encloser that is asserted, then DNAME substitution should have
	been done, but the substitution has not been done as specified.
	</t>
</section> <section title="DNAME Chains as Strong as the Weakest Link">
	<t>
	A response can contain a chain of DNAME and CNAME redirections.
	That chain can end in a positive answer or a negative (no name error or
	no data error) reply.  Each step in that chain results in resource 
	records added to the answer or authority section of the response. 
	Only if all steps are secure can the AD bit be set for the response.
	If one of the steps is bogus, the result is bogus.  
	</t>
</section>
<section title="Validators Must Understand DNAME" anchor="validname">
	<t>
	Below are examples of why DNSSEC validators MUST understand DNAME.
	In the examples below, SOA records, wildcard denial NSECs and 
	other material not under discussion has been omitted or shortened.
	</t>

	If this is the received response, then only by understanding that the 
	DNAME bit in the NSEC bitmap means that foo.bar.example.com needed to have been

	This response has the same NSEC records as the example above,

	The response shown above has the synthesized CNAME included.
	However, the CNAME has no signature, since the server does not
	sign online. So this response cannot be trusted. It could be altered by
	an attacker to be foo.bar.example.com CNAME bla.bla.example.
	The DNAME record does have its signature included, since it
	does not change. The validator must verify
	the DNAME signature and then recursively resolve further to 
	query for the foo.bar.example.net A record.

<section anchor="example" title="Examples of DNAME Use in a Zone">
 	<t>
	Below are some examples of the use of DNAME in a zone.  These examples are by no means exhaustive.
	</t>
<section title="Organizational Renaming">
	<t>
	If an organization with domain name FROBOZZ.EXAMPLE.NET became part of an
   organization with domain name ACME.EXAMPLE.COM, it might ease transition
   by placing information such as this in its old zone.
<figure title=""><preamble></preamble>
<artwork>
    
    frobozz.example.net.  DNAME    frobozz-division.acme.example.com.
                          MX       10       mailhub.acme.example.com.
</artwork>
</figure>
	</t>
	<t>
The response to an extended recursive query for www.frobozz.example.net
   would contain, in the answer section, the DNAME record shown above
   and the relevant RRs for www.frobozz-division.acme.example.com.
	</t>
<t>
If an organization wants to have aliases for names, for a different spelling or language,
the same example applies.  Note that the MX RR at the zone apex is not redirected
and has to be repeated in the target zone.  Also note that the services at mailhub or
www.frobozz-division.acme.example.com. have to recognize and handle the aliases.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Classless Delegation of Shorter Prefixes">
	<t>
	The classless scheme for in-addr.arpa delegation <xref target="RFC2317" /> can be
   extended to prefixes shorter than 24 bits by use of the DNAME record.
   For example, the prefix 192.0.8.0/22 can be delegated by the
   following records.
<figure title=""><preamble></preamble>
<artwork>
    $ORIGIN 0.192.in-addr.arpa.
    8/22    NS       ns.slash-22-holder.example.com.
    8       DNAME    8.8/22
    9       DNAME    9.8/22
    10      DNAME    10.8/22
    11      DNAME    11.8/22

</artwork>
</figure></t>
<t>
 A typical entry in the resulting reverse zone for some host with
   address 192.0.9.33 might be
<figure title=""><preamble></preamble>
<artwork>
     $ORIGIN 8/22.0.192.in-addr.arpa.
     33.9    PTR     somehost.slash-22-holder.example.com.
</artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
The same advisory remarks concerning the choice of the "/" character
   apply here as in <xref target="RFC2317" /> .
</t>
</section>
<section title="Network Renumbering Support">
<t>
If IPv4 network renumbering were common, maintenance of address space
   delegation could be simplified by using DNAME records instead of NS
   records to delegate.
<figure title=""><preamble></preamble>
<artwork>
    $ORIGIN new-style.in-addr.arpa.
    189.190           DNAME    in-addr.example.net.

    $ORIGIN in-addr.example.net.
    188               DNAME    in-addr.customer.example.com.

    $ORIGIN in-addr.customer.example.
    1                 PTR      www.customer.example.com
    2                 PTR      mailhub.customer.example.com.
    ; etc ...
</artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
This would allow the address space 190.189.0.0/16 assigned to the ISP
   "example.net" to be changed without the necessity of altering the
   zone data describing the use of that space by the ISP and its
   customers.
</t>
<t>
   Renumbering IPv4 networks is currently so arduous a task that
   updating the DNS is only a small part of the labor, so this scheme
   may have a low value.  But it is hoped that in IPv6 the renumbering
   task will be quite different and the DNAME mechanism may play a
   useful part.
</t>

<section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
	<t>The DNAME Resource Record type code 39 (decimal) originally has been
	registered by [RFC2672] in the DNS Resource Record (RR) Types registry table at
	http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters.  IANA should update the DNS resource record
	registry to point to this document for RR type 39.
	</t>
</section>

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
	<t>
	DNAME redirects queries elsewhere, which may impact security based 
	on policy and the security status of the zone with the DNAME and 
	the redirection zone's security status. For validating resolvers,
	the lowest security status of the links in the chain of CNAME and 
	DNAME redirections is applied to the result.
	</t><t>
	If a validating resolver accepts wildcarded DNAMEs, this creates
	security issues.  Since the processing of a wildcarded DNAME is 
	non-deterministic and the CNAME that was substituted by the 
	server has no signature, the resolver may choose a different 
	result than what the server meant, and consequently end up at 
	the wrong destination. Use of wildcarded DNAMEs is discouraged in 
	any case <xref target="RFC4592" />.
	</t><t>
	A validating resolver MUST understand DNAME, according to 
	<xref target="RFC4034" />. The examples in <xref target="validname" /> 
	illustrate this need.

<section title="Introduction">
    <t>
YANG <xref target="RFC6020"/> is a data modeling language used to model configuration
and state data manipulated by the Network Configuration Protocol
(NETCONF) <xref target="RFC6241"/>. The YANG language supports a small set of
built-in data types and provides mechanisms to derive other types from
the built-in types.
    </t>
    <t>
This document introduces a collection of common data types derived
from the built-in YANG data types. The derived types are designed to
be applicable for modeling all areas of management information. The
definitions are organized in several YANG modules. The
&quot;ietf&#8209;yang&#8209;types&quot; module contains generally useful data types. The
&quot;ietf&#8209;inet&#8209;types&quot; module contains definitions that are relevant for
the Internet protocol suite.
    </t>
    <t>
This version of the document adds new type definitions to the YANG
modules and obsoletes <xref target="RFC6021"/>. For the further details, see the
revision statement of the YANG modules.

The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
&quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
&quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
14 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
    </t>
</section>
<section title="Overview">
    <t>
This section provides a short overview of the types defined in
subsequent sections and their equivalent Structure of Management
Information Version 2 (SMIv2) <xref target="RFC2578"/><xref target="RFC2579"/> data types. A YANG
data type is equivalent to an SMIv2 data type if the data types have
the same set of values and the semantics of the values are equivalent.
    </t>
    <t>
<xref target="t1"/> lists the types defined in the ietf-yang-types YANG module and
the corresponding SMIv2 types (- indicates there is no corresponding
SMIv2 type).

      standard for representation of dates and times using the
      Gregorian calendar.  The profile is defined by the
      date-time production in Section 5.6 of RFC 3339.

      The date-and-time type is compatible with the dateTime XML
      schema type with the following notable exceptions:

      (a) The date-and-time type does not allow negative years.

      (b) The date-and-time time-offset -00:00 indicates an unknown
          time zone (see RFC 3339) while -00:00 and +00:00 and Z all
          represent the same time zone in dateTime.

      (c) The canonical format (see below) of data-and-time values
          differs from the canonical format used by the dateTime XML
          schema type, which requires all times to be in UTC using 
          the time-offset 'Z'.

      This type is not equivalent to the DateAndTime textual 
      convention of the SMIv2 since RFC 3339 uses a different
      separator between full-date and full-time and provides
      higher resolution of time-secfrac.

      The canonical format for date-and-time values with a known time
      zone uses a numeric time zone offset that is calculated using
      the device's configured known offset to UTC time.  A change of
      the device's offset to UTC time will cause date-and-time values
      to change accordingly.  Such changes might happen periodically
      in case a server follows automatically daylight saving time
      (DST) time zone offset changes.  The canonical format for
      date-and-time values with an unknown time zone (usually 
      referring to the notion of local time) uses the time-offset

     "The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name.  The 
      name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

      Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
      3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section 
      2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow
      for current practice in domain name use, and some possible
      future expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of
      domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
      (host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
      that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
      in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
      1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
      schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
      adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

      The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
      to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
      prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
      byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
      notation.

      The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
      type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
      IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
      may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
      and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
      which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
      explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the
      resolver.

      Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
      format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
      domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC

This document defines common data types using the YANG data modeling
language. The definitions themselves have no security impact on the
Internet but the usage of these definitions in concrete YANG modules
might have. The security considerations spelled out in the YANG
specification <xref target="RFC6020"/> apply for this document as well.

            A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
            that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification
            defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
            that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
            considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
            The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
            allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI
            reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
            possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative
            grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual
            specifications of each URI scheme.

<title>Punycode: A Bootstring encoding of Unicode for Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)</title>
<author initials='A.' surname='Costello' fullname='A. Costello'>
<organization /></author>
<date year='2003' month='March' />
<abstract>
<t>Punycode is a simple and efficient transfer encoding syntax designed for use with Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA).  It uniquely and reversibly transforms a Unicode string into an ASCII string.  ASCII characters in the Unicode string are represented literally, and non-ASCII characters are represented by ASCII characters that are allowed in host name labels (letters, digits, and hyphens).  This document defines a general algorithm called Bootstring that allows a string of basic code points to uniquely represent any string of code points drawn from a larger set.  Punycode is an instance of Bootstring that uses particular parameter values specified by this document, appropriate for IDNA. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

        <abstract>
          <t>
            Differentiated services enhancements to the Internet protocol are
            intended to enable scalable service discrimination in the Internet
            without the need for per-flow state and signaling at every hop.  A
            variety of services may be built from a small, well-defined set of
            building blocks which are deployed in network nodes.  The services
            may be either end-to-end or intra-domain; they include both those
            that can satisfy quantitative performance requirements (e.g., peak
            bandwidth) and those based on relative performance (e.g., &quot;class&quot;
            differentiation).  Services can be constructed by a combination of:
            
            <list>
              <t>
                - setting bits in an IP header field at network boundaries
                (autonomous system boundaries, internal administrative boundaries,
                or hosts),
              </t>
              <t>
                - using those bits to determine how packets are forwarded by the
                nodes inside the network, and
              </t>
              <t>
                - conditioning the marked packets at network boundaries in accordance
                with the requirements or rules of each service.
          </t></list></t>
          <t>
            The requirements or rules of each service must be set through
            administrative policy mechanisms which are outside the scope of this
            document.  A differentiated services-compliant network node includes
            a classifier that selects packets based on the value of the DS field,
            along with buffer management and packet scheduling mechanisms capable
            of delivering the specific packet forwarding treatment indicated by
            the DS field value.  Setting of the DS field and conditioning of the
            temporal behavior of marked packets need only be performed at network
            boundaries and may vary in complexity.
          </t>
          <t>
            This document defines the IP header field, called the DS (for
            differentiated services) field.  In IPv4, it defines the layout of
            the TOS octet; in IPv6, the Traffic Class octet.  In addition, a base
            set of packet forwarding treatments, or per-hop behaviors, is
            defined.
          </t>
          <t>
            For a more complete understanding of differentiated services, see
            also the differentiated services architecture .

          <t>This document discusses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is an inter-Autonomous System routing protocol.&lt;/t>&lt;t> The primary function of a BGP speaking system is to exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems. This network reachability information includes information on the list of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that reachability information traverses. This information is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS connectivity for this reachability from which routing loops may be pruned, and, at the AS level, some policy decisions may be enforced.&lt;/t>&lt;t> BGP-4 provides a set of mechanisms for supporting Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). These mechanisms include support for advertising a set of destinations as an IP prefix, and eliminating the concept of network "class" within BGP. BGP-4 also introduces mechanisms that allow aggregation of routes, including aggregation of AS paths.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This document obsoletes RFC 1771. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

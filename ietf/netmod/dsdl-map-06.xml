    <t>This draft specifies the mapping rules for translating YANG
    data models into Document Schema Definition Languages (DSDL), a
    coordinated set of XML schema languages standardized as ISO
    19757. The following DSDL schema languages are addressed by the
    mapping: RELAX NG, Schematron and DSRL. The mapping takes one or
    more YANG modules and produces a set of DSDL schemas for a
    selected target document type - datastore content, NETCONF message
    etc. Procedures for schema-based validation of such documents are
    also discussed.</t>

  <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
    <t>The NETCONF Working Group has completed a base protocol used
    for configuration management <xref target="RFC4741"/>. This base
    specification defines protocol bindings and an XML container
    syntax for configuration and management operations, but does not
    include a data modeling language or accompanying rules for how to
    model configuration and state information carried by NETCONF. The
    IETF Operations Area has a long tradition of defining data for
    SNMP Management Information Bases (MIBs) <xref target="RFC1157"/>
    using the SMI language <xref target="RFC2578"/> to model its
    data. While this specific modeling approach has a number of
    well-understood problems, most of the data modeling features
    provided by SMI are still considered extremely important.  Simply
    modeling the valid syntax without the additional semantic
    relationships has caused significant interoperability problems in
    the past.</t>

    <t>The NETCONF community concluded that a data modeling framework
    is needed to support ongoing development of IETF and
    vendor-defined management information modules. The NETMOD Working
    Group was chartered to address this problem by defining a new
    human-friendly modeling language based on SMIng <xref
    target="RFC3216"/> and called YANG <xref target="YANG"/>. </t>

    <t>Since NETCONF uses XML for encoding its messages, it is natural
    to express the constraints on NETCONF content using standard XML
    schema languages. For this purpose, the NETMOD WG selected the
    Document Schema Definition Languages (DSDL) that is being
    standardized as ISO/IEC 19757 <xref target="DSDL"/>. The DSDL
    framework comprises a set of XML schema languages that address
    grammar rules, semantic constraints and other data modeling
    aspects, but also, and more importantly, do it in a coordinated
    and consistent way. While it is true that some DSDL parts have not
    been standardized yet and are still work in progress, the three
    parts that the YANG-to-DSDL mapping relies upon - RELAX NG,
    Schematron and DSRL - already have the status of an ISO/IEC
    International Standard and are supported in a number of software
    tools.</t>

    <t>This document contains a specification of a mapping that
    translates YANG data models to XML schemas utilizing a subset of
    the DSDL schema languages. The mapping procedure is divided into
    two steps: In the first step, the structure of the data tree,
    signatures of RPC operations and notifications is expressed as the
    so-called "hybrid schema" - a single RELAX NG schema with
    annotations representing additional data model information
    (metadata, documentation, semantic constraints, default values
    etc.). The second step then generates a coordinated set of DSDL
    schemas that can be used for validating specific XML documents
    such as client requests, server responses or notifications,
    perhaps also taking into account additional context such as active
    capabilities or features.</t>

  <section anchor="objectivesMotivation" title="Objectives and Motivation">
    <t>The main objective of this work is to complement YANG as a data
    modeling language by validation capabilities of DSDL schema
    languages, namely RELAX NG, Schematron and DSRL. This document
    describes the correspondence between grammatical, semantic and
    data type constraints expressed in YANG and equivalent DSDL
    patterns and rules. The ultimate goal is to be able to capture all
    substantial information contained in YANG modules and express it
    in DSDL schemas. While the mapping from YANG to DSDL described in
    this document may in principle be invertible, the inverse mapping
    from DSDL to YANG beyond the scope of this document.</t>
    <t>XML-based information models and XML-encoded data appear in
    several different forms in various phases of YANG data modeling
    and NETCONF workflow - configuration datastore contents, RPC
    requests and replies, and notifications. Moreover, RPC operations are
    characterized by an inherent diversity resulting from selective
    availability of capabilities and features. YANG modules can also
    define new RPC operations. The mapping should be able to accommodate
    this variability and generate schemas that are specifically
    tailored to a particular situation and thus considerably more
    effective for validation than generic all-encompassing schemas.</t>

    <t>In order to cope with this variability, we assume that the DSDL
    schemas will be generated on demand for a particular purpose from
    the available collection of YANG modules and their lifetime will
    be relatively short. In other words, we don't envision that any
    collection of DSDL schemas will be created and maintained over an
    extended period of time in parallel to YANG modules.</t>
    <t>The generated schemas are primarily intended as input to
    existing XML schema validators and other off-the-shelf
    tools. However, the schemas may also be perused by developers and
    users as a formal representation of constraints on a particular
    XML-encoded data object. Consequently, our secondary goal is to
    keep the schemas as readable as possible. To this end, the
    complexity of the mapping is distributed into two steps:
    <list style="numbers">
      <t anchor="m-step1">The first step maps one or more YANG modules
      to the so-called hybrid schema, which is a single RELAX NG
      schema that describes grammatical constraints for the main data
      tree as well as for RPC operations and notifications. Semantic
      constraints and other information appearing in the input YANG
      modules is recorded in the hybrid schema in the form of foreign
      namespace annotations. The output of the first step can thus be
      considered a virtually complete equivalent of the input YANG
      modules.</t>
      <t>In the second step, the hybrid schema from step <xref
      format="counter" target="m-step1"/> is transformed further to a
      coordinated set of fully conformant DSDL schemas containing
      constraints for a particular data object and a specific
      situation. The DSDL schemas are intended mainly for machine
      validation using off-the-shelf tools.</t>

  <section anchor="schema-lang" title="DSDL Schema Languages">

    <t>Document Schema Definition Languages (DSDL) is a framework of
    schema languages that is being developed as the International
    Standard ISO/IEC 19757. Unlike other approaches to XML document
    validation, most notably W3C XML Schema (XSD) <xref
    target="XSD"/>, the DSDL framework adheres to the principle of
    "small languages": Each of the DSDL constituents is a stand-alone
    schema language with a relatively narrow purpose and
    focus. Together, these schema languages may be used in a
    coordinated way to accomplish various validation tasks.</t>

    <t>The mapping described in this document uses three of the DSDL
    schema languages, namely RELAX NG, Schematron and DSRL.</t>

    <section anchor="relaxng" title="RELAX NG">
      <t>RELAX NG (pronounced "relaxing") is an XML schema language
      for grammar-based validation and Part 2 of the ISO/IEC DSDL
      family of standards <xref target="RNG"/>. Like the W3C XML
      Schema language <xref target="XSD"/>, it is able to describe
      constraints on the structure and contents of XML
      documents. However, unlike the DTD <xref target="XML"/> and XSD
      schema languages, RELAX NG intentionally avoids any infoset
      augmentation such as defining default values. In the DSDL
      architecture, the particular task of defining and applying
      default values is delegated to another schema language, DSRL
      (see <xref target="dsrl"/>).</t>

      <t>As its base datatype library, RELAX NG uses the W3C XML
      Schema Datatype Library <xref target="XSD-D"/>, but unlike XSD,
      other datatype libraries may be used along with it or even
      replace it if necessary. </t>

      <t>RELAX NG is very liberal in accepting annotations from other
      namespaces. With a few exceptions, such annotations may be placed
      anywhere in the schema and need no encapsulating elements such
      as &lt;xsd:annotation&gt; in XSD.</t>

      <t>RELAX NG schemas can be represented in two equivalent
      syntaxes: XML and compact. The compact syntax is described in
      Annex C of the RELAX NG specification <xref target="RNG-CS"/>,
      which was added to the standard in 2006 (Amendment 1). Automatic
      bidirectional conversions between the two syntaxes can be
      accomplished using several tools, for example <eref
      target="http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/trang.html">Trang</eref>.
      </t>

      <t>For its terseness and readability, the compact syntax is
      often the preferred form for publishing RELAX NG schemas whereas
      validators and other software tools usually work with the XML
      syntax. However, the compact syntax has two drawbacks:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>External annotations make the compact syntax schema
        considerably less readable. While in the XML syntax the
        annotating elements and attributes are represented in a simple
        and uniform way (XML elements and attributes from foreign
        namespaces), the compact syntax uses as many as four different
        syntactic constructs: documentation, grammar, initial and
        following annotations. Therefore, the impact of annotations on
        readability is often much stronger for the compact syntax than
        it is for the XML syntax.</t>
        <t>In a computer program, it is more difficult to generate the
        compact syntax than the XML syntax. While a number of software
        libraries exist that make it easy to create an XML tree in the
        memory and then serialize it, no such aid is available for the
        compact syntax.</t>
      </list>
      For these reasons, the mapping specification in this document
      uses exclusively the XML syntax. Where appropriate, though, the
      schemas resulting from the translation MAY be presented in the
      equivalent compact syntax.</t>
      <t>RELAX NG elements are qualified with the namespace URI
      "http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0". The namespace of the W3C
      Schema Datatype Library is
      "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes".</t>
  </section>

    <section anchor="schematron" title="Schematron">
      <t>Schematron is Part 3 of DSDL that reached the status of a
      full ISO/IEC standard in 2006 <xref target="Schematron"/>. In
      contrast to the traditional schema languages such as DTD, XSD or
      RELAX NG, which are based on the concept of a formal grammar,
      Schematron utilizes a rule-based approach. Its rules may specify
      arbitrary conditions involving data from different parts of an
      XML document. Each rule consists of three essential components:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>context - an XPath expression that defines the set of
        locations where the rule is to be applied;</t>
        <t>assert or report condition - another XPath expression that
        is evaluated relative to the location matched by the context
        expression;</t>
        <t>human-readable message that is displayed when the assert
        condition is false or report condition is true.</t>
      </list>
      The difference between the assert and report condition is that
      the former is positive in that it states a condition that a
      valid document has to satisfy, whereas the latter specifies an
      error condition.</t>
      <t>Schematron draws most of its expressive power from XPath
      <xref target="XPath"/> and XSLT <xref target="XSLT"/>. ISO
      Schematron allows for dynamic query language binding so that the
      following XML query languages can be used: STX, XSLT 1.0,
      XSLT 1.1, EXSLT, XSLT 2.0, XPath 1.0, XPath 2.0 and XQuery 1.0
      (this list may be extended in the future).</t>
      <t>Human-readable error messages are another feature that sets
      Schematron apart from other common schema languages. The
      messages may even contain XPath expressions that are evaluated
      in the actual context and thus refer to information items in the
      XML document being validated.</t>
      <t>Another feature of Schematron that is used by the mapping are
      abstract patterns. These work essentially as macros and may also
      contain parameters which are supplied when the abstract pattern
      is used.</t>
      <t>Schematron elements are qualified with namespace URI
      "http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron".</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="dsrl"
             title="Document Semantics Renaming Language (DSRL)">
      <t>DSRL (pronounced "disrule") is Part 8 of DSDL that reached
      the status of a full ISO/IEC standard in 2008 <xref
      target="DSRL"/>. Unlike RELAX NG and Schematron, DSRL is allowed
      to modify XML information set of the validated document. While
      DSRL is primarily intended for renaming XML elements and
      attributes, it can also define default values for XML attributes
      and default contents for XML elements or subtrees so that the
      default contents are inserted if they are missing in the
      validated documents. The latter feature is used by the
      YANG-to-DSDL mapping for representing YANG default contents
      consisting of leaf nodes with default values and their ancestor
      non-presence containers.</t>
      <t>DSRL elements are qualified with namespace URI
      "http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/dsrl".</t>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section anchor="annotations" title="Additional Annotations">

    <t>Besides the DSDL schema languages, the mapping also uses three
    sets of annotations that are added as foreign-namespace attributes
    and elements to RELAX NG schemas.</t>
    <t>Two of the annotation sets - Dublin Core elements and DTD
    compatibility annotations - are standard vocabularies for
    representing metadata and documentation, respectively. Although
    these data model items are not used for formal validation, they
    quite often carry important information for data model
    implementers. Therefore, they SHOULD be included in the hybrid
    schema and MAY also appear in the final validation schemas.</t>
    <t>The third set are NETMOD-specific annotations. They are
    specifically designed for the hybrid schema and convey semantic
    constraints and other information that cannot be expressed
    directly in RELAX NG. In the second mapping step, these
    annotations are converted to Schematron and DSRL rules.</t>

    <t> The mapping procedure is divided into two steps:   
    <list style="numbers">                                 
      <t>Transformation T in the first step maps one or more YANG
      modules to the hybrid schema (see <xref
      target="hybridSchema"/>). Constraints that cannot be expressed
      directly in RELAX NG (list key definitions, 'must' statements
      etc.) and various documentation texts are recorded in the schema
      as foreign-namespace annotations.</t>
                                                           
      <t>In the second step, the hybrid schema may be transformed in
      multiple ways to a coordinated set of DSDL schemas that can be
      used for validating a particular data object in a specific
      context. <xref target="fig-mapschema"/> shows three simple
      possibilities as examples. In the process, appropriate parts of
      the hybrid schema are extracted and specific annotations
      transformed to equivalent, but usually more complex, Schematron
      patterns, DSRL element maps etc.</t>
    </list></t>

    <t>An implementation of the mapping algorithm MUST accept one or
    more valid YANG modules as its input. It is important to be able
    to process multiple YANG modules together since multiple modules
    may be negotiated for a NETCONF session and the contents of the
    configuration datastore is then obtained as the union of data
    trees specified by the individual modules, which may also lead to
    multiple root nodes of the datastore hierarchy. In addition, the
    input modules may be further coupled by the 'augment' statement in
    which one module augments the data tree of another module.</t>

    <t>It is also assumed that the algorithm has access, perhaps on
    demand, to all YANG modules that the input modules import
    (directly or transitively).</t>

    <t>Other information contained in input YANG modules, such as
    semantic constraints and default values, are recorded in the
    hybrid schema as annotations - XML attributes or elements
    qualified with namespace URI
    "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netmod:dsdl-annotations:1". Metadata
    describing the YANG modules are mapped to Dublin Core annotations
    elements (<xref target="dcElements"/>). Finally, documentation
    strings are mapped to &lt;a:documentation&gt; elements belonging
    to the DTD compatibility vocabulary (<xref
    target="dtdCompatibility"/>).</t>

    <t>The output of the second step is a coordinated set of three
    DSDL schemas corresponding to a specific data object and context:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>RELAX NG schema describing the grammatical and datatype
      constraints;</t>
      <t>Schematron schema expressing other constraints such as
      uniqueness of list keys or user-specified semantic rules;</t>
      <t>DSRL schema containing the specification of default
      contents.</t>

  <section anchor="design" title="Design Considerations">
    <t>YANG data models could in principle be mapped to the DSDL schemas
    in a number of ways. The mapping procedure described in this
    document uses several specific design decisions that are discussed
    in the following subsections.</t>

    <section anchor="hybridSchema" title="Hybrid Schema">
      <t>As was explained in <xref target="mappingOverview"/>, the
      first step of the mapping produces an intermediate document -
      the hybrid schema, which specifies all constraints for the
      entire data model in a single RELAX NG schema.</t>
      <t>Every input YANG module corresponds to exactly one embedded
      grammar in the hybrid schema. This separation of input YANG
      modules allows each embedded grammar to include named pattern
      definitions into its own namespace, which is important for
      mapping YANG groupings (see <xref target="grouping-typedef"/>
      for additional details).</t>
      <t>In addition to grammatical and datatype constraints, YANG
      modules provide other important information that cannot be
      expressed in a RELAX NG schema: semantic constraints, default
      values, metadata, documentation and so on. Such information
      items are represented in the hybrid schema as XML attributes and
      elements belonging to the namespace with the following URI:
      "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netmod:dsdl-annotations:1". A complete
      list of these annotations is given in <xref
      target="netmodAnnotations"/>, detailed rules about their use are
      then contained in the following sections.</t>
      <t>YANG modules define data models not only for configuration
      and state data but also for (multiple) RPC operations <xref
      target="RFC4741"/> and/or event notifications <xref
      target="RFC5277"/>. In order to be able to capture all three
      types of data models in one schema document, the hybrid schema
      uses special markers that enclose sub-schemas for configuration
      and state data, individual RPC operations (both input and output
      part) and individual notifications.</t>
      <t>The markers are the following XML elements in the namespace
      of NETMOD-specific annotations (URI
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netmod:dsdl-annotations:1):</t>

      <texttable anchor="table-hybrid-tree-elements"
                 title="Marker elements in the hybrid schema">
        <ttcol>Element name</ttcol>
        <ttcol>Role</ttcol>
        <c>nma:data</c><c>encloses configuration and state data</c>
        <c>nma:rpcs</c><c>encloses all RPC operations</c>
        <c>nma:rpc</c><c>encloses an individual RPC operation</c>
        <c>nma:input</c><c>encloses an RPC request</c>

        <c>nma:notification</c><c>encloses an individual notification</c>
      </texttable>

      <t>For example, consider a data model formed by two YANG modules
      "example-a" and "example-b" that define nodes in the namespaces
      "http://example.com/ns/example-a" and
      "http://example.com/ns/example-b". Module "example-a" defines
      configuration/state data, RPC methods and notifications, whereas
      "example-b" defines only configuration/state data. The hybrid
      schema can then be schematically represented as follows:</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="modularity" title="Modularity">
      <t>Both YANG and RELAX NG offer means for modularity, i.e., for
      splitting the contents of a full schema into separate modules
      and combining or reusing them in various ways. However, the
      approaches taken by YANG and RELAX NG differ. Modularity in
      RELAX NG is suitable for ad hoc combinations of a small number
      of schemas whereas YANG assumes a large set of modules similar
      to SNMP MIBs. The following differences are important:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>In YANG, whenever module A imports module B, it gets access
        to the definitions (groupings and typedefs) appearing at the
        top level of module B. However, no part of data tree from
        module B is imported along with it. In contrast, the
        &lt;rng:include&gt; pattern in RELAX NG imports both
        definitions of named patterns and the entire schema tree from
        the included schema.</t>
        <t>The names of imported YANG groupings and typedefs are
        qualified with the namespace of the imported module. On the
        other hand, the names of data nodes contained inside the
        imported groupings, when used within the importing module,
        become part of the importing module's namespace. In RELAX NG,
        the names of patterns are unqualified and so named patterns
        defined in both the importing and imported module share the
        same flat namespace. The contents of RELAX NG named patterns
        may either keep the namespace of the schema where they are
        defined or inherit the namespace of the importing module,
        analogically to YANG. However, in order to achieve the latter
        behavior, the definitions of named patterns must be included
        from an external schema which has to be prepared in a special
        way (see <xref target="Vli04"/>, Chapter 11).</t>
      </list></t>
      <t>In order to map, as much as possible, the modularity of YANG
      to RELAX NG, a validating RELAX NG schema (the result of the
      second mapping step) has to be split into two files, one of them
      containing all global definitions that are mapped from top-level
      YANG groupings appearing in all input YANG module. This RELAX NG
      schema MUST NOT define any namespace via the @ns attribute.</t>
      <t>The other RELAX NG schema file then defines actual data trees
      mapped from input YANG modules, each of them enclosed in an own
      embedded grammar. Those embedded grammars in which at least one
      of the global definitions is used MUST include the first schema
      with definitions and also MUST define the local namespace using
      the @ns attribute. This way, the global definitions can be used
      inside different embedded grammar, each time accepting a
      different local namespace.</t>
      <t>Named pattern definition that are mapped from non-top-level
      YANG groupings MUST be placed inside the embedded grammar
      corresponding to the YANG module where the grouping is
      defined.</t>
      <t>In the hybrid schema, we need to distinguish the global and
      non-global named pattern definitions while still keeping the
      hybrid schema in one file. This is accomplished in the following
      way:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Every global definition MUST be placed as a child of the
        the outer &lt;rng:grammar&gt; element (the document root of
        the hybrid schema).</t>
        <t>Every non-global definitions MUST be placed as a child of
        the corresponding embedded &lt;rng:grammar&gt; element.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>YANG also allows for splitting a module into a number of
      submodules. However, as submodules have no impact on the scope
      of identifiers and namespaces, the modularity based on
      submodules is not mapped in any way. The contents of
      submodules is therefore handled as if the submodule text
      appeared directly in the main module.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="granularity" title="Granularity">
      <t>RELAX NG supports different styles of schema structuring: One
      extreme, often called "Russian Doll", specifies the structure of
      an XML instance document in a single hierarchy. The other
      extreme, the flat style, uses a similar approach as the Data
      Type Definition (DTD) schema language - every XML element
      corresponds to a named pattern definition. In practice, some
      compromise between the two extremes is usually chosen.</t>
      <t>YANG supports both styles in principle, too, but in most
      cases the modules are organized in a way closer to the "Russian
      Doll" style, which provides a better insight into the structure
      of the configuration data. Groupings are usually defined only
      for contents that are prepared for reuse in multiple places via
      the 'uses' statement. In contrast, RELAX NG schemas tend to be
      much flatter, because finer granularity is also needed in RELAX
      NG for extensibility of the schemas - it is only possible to
      replace or modify schema fragments that are factored out as
      named patterns. For YANG this is not an issue since its
      'augment' and 'refine' statements can delve, by using path
      expressions, into arbitrary depths of existing structures.</t>
      <t>In general, it not feasible to map YANG's powerful extension
      mechanisms to those available in RELAX NG. For this reason, the
      mapping essentially keeps the granularity of the original YANG
      data model: YANG groupings and definitions of derived types
      usually have direct counterparts in definitions of named
      patterns in the resulting RELAX NG schema.</t>

    <section anchor="XML-NS" title="Handling of XML Namespaces">

      <t>Most modern XML schema languages, including RELAX NG,
      Schematron and DSRL, support schemas for so-called compound XML
      documents which contain elements from multiple namespaces. This
      is useful for our purpose since the YANG-to-DSDL mapping allows
      for multiple input YANG modules, which naturally leads to
      compound document schemas.</t>
      <t>RELAX NG offers two alternatives for defining the target
      namespaces in the schema:
      <list style="numbers">
        <t anchor="xmlns-att">First possibility is the traditional XML
        way via the @xmlns:xxx attribute.</t>
        <t anchor="ns-att">One of the target namespace
        URIs may be declared using the @ns attribute.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>In both the hybrid schema and validation RELAX NG schemas
      generated in the second step, the namespaces MUST be declared as
      follows:
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>The root &lt;rng:grammar&gt; MUST have @xmlns:xxx
        attributes declaring prefixes of all namespaces that are used
        in the data model. The prefixes SHOULD be identical to those
        defined in the 'prefix' statements. An implementation of the
        mapping MUST resolve all collisions in the prefixes defined by
        different input modules, if there are any.</t>
        <t>Each embedded &lt;rng:grammar&gt; element must declare the
        namespace of the corresponding module using the @ns
        attribute. This way, the names of nodes defined by global
        named patterns are able to adopt the local namespace of each
        embedded grammar, as explained in <xref target="modularity"/>.
        </t>
      </list></t>
      <t>This setup is illustrated by the example at the end of <xref
      target="hybridSchema"/>.</t>

      <t>DSRL schemas may declare any number of target namespaces via
      the standard XML attributes xmlns:xxx.</t>

      <t>In contrast, Schematron requires all used namespaces to be
      defined in the &lt;sch:ns&gt; subelements of the document
      element &lt;sch:schema&gt;.</t>

  <section
      anchor="desc-yang-to-hs"
      title="Mapping YANG Data Models to the Hybrid Schema">

    <t>This section explains the main principles governing the first
    step of the mapping. Its result is the hybrid schema which is
    described in <xref target="hybridSchema"/>.</t>

    <t>A detailed specification of the mapping of individual YANG
    statements is contained in the following <xref
    target="yang-to-rng"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="occurrence-rules"
             title="Occurrence Rules for Data Nodes">

      <t>In DSDL schema languages, occurrence constraints for a node
      are always localized together with that node. In a RELAX NG
      schema, for example, &lt;rng:optional&gt; pattern appears as the
      parent element of the pattern defining a leaf or non-leaf
      element. Similarly, DSRL specifies default contents separately
      for every single node, be it a leaf or non-leaf element.</t>

      <t>For leaf nodes in YANG modules, the occurrence constraints
      are also easily inferred from the substatements of 'leaf'. On
      the other hand, for a YANG container it is often necessary to
      examine its entire subtree in order to determine the container's
      occurrence constraints.</t>

      <t>Therefore, one of the goals of the first mapping step is to
      infer the occurrence constraints for all data nodes and mark
      accordingly the corresponding &lt;rng:element&gt; patterns in
      the hybrid schema so that any transformation procedure
      in the second mapping step can simply use this information and
      need not examine the subtree again.</t>

      <t>First, it has to be decided whether a given data node must
      always be present in a valid configuration. If so, such a node
      is called mandatory, otherwise it is called optional. This
      constraint is closely related to the notion of mandatory nodes
      in <eref
      target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-netmod-yang-10#section-3.1">Section
      3.1</eref> in <xref target="YANG"/>. The only difference is that
      this document also considers list keys to be mandatory.</t>

      <t>The other occurrence constraint has to do with the semantics
      of the 'default' statement and the possibility of removing empty
      non-presence containers. As a result, the information set of a
      valid configuration may be modified by adding or removing
      certain leaf or container elements without changing the meaning
      of the configuration. In this document, such elements are called
      implicit. In the hybrid schema, they can be identified as RELAX
      NG patterns having either @nma:default or @nma:implicit
      attribute.</t>

      <t>Note that both occurrence constraints apply to containers at
      the top level of the data tree, and then also to other
      containers under the additional condition that their parent node
      exists in the instance document. For example, consider the
      following YANG fragment:</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork>
    container outer {
        presence 'Presence of "outer" means something.';
        container c1 {
            leaf foo {
                type uint8;
                default 1;
            }
        }
        container c2 {
            leaf-list bar {
                type uint8;
                min-elements 0;
            }
        }
        container c3 {
            leaf baz {
                type uint8;
                mandatory true;
            }
        }
    }</artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>Here, container "outer" has the 'presence' substatement,
      which means that it is optional and not implicit. If "outer" is
      not present in a configuration, its child containers are not
      present as well. However, if "outer" does exist, it makes sense
      to ask which of its child containers are optional and which are
      implicit. In this case, "c1" is optional and implicit, "c2" is
      optional but not implicit and "c3" is mandatory (and therefore
      not implicit).</t>

      <t>The following subsections give precise rules for determining
      whether a container is optional or mandatory and whether it is
      implicit. In order to simplify the recursive definition of these
      occurrence characteristics, it is useful to define them also for
      other types of YANG schema nodes, i.e., leaf, list, leaf-list
      and anyxml and choice.</t>

      <section anchor="optional-mandatory"
               title="Optional and Mandatory Nodes">

        <t>The decision whether a given node is mandatory or optional
        is governed by the following rules:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Leaf, anyxml and choice nodes are mandatory if they
          contain the substatement "mandatory true;". For a choice
          node this means that at least one node from exactly one case
          branch must exist.</t>
          <t>In addition, a leaf node is mandatory if it is
          declared as a list key.</t>
          <t>A list or leaf-list node is mandatory if it contains the
          'min-elements' substatement with an argument value greater than
          zero.</t>
          <t>A container node is mandatory if its definition does not
          contain the 'presence' substatement and at least one of its
          child nodes is mandatory.</t>
        </list></t>

        <t>A node is optional if and only if it is not mandatory.</t>

        <t>In RELAX NG, definitions of nodes that are optional must be
        explicitly wrapped in the &lt;rng:optional&gt; element. The
        mapping MUST use the above rules to determine whether a YANG
        node is optional and if so, insert the &lt;rng:optional&gt;
        element in the hybrid schema.</t>

        <t>However, alternatives in &lt;rng:choice&gt; MUST NOT be
        defined as optional in the hybrid schema. If a choice in YANG
        is not mandatory, &lt;rng:optional&gt; MUST be used to wrap
        the entire &lt;rng:choice&gt; pattern.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="implicit-nodes" title="Implicit Nodes">
        <t>The following rules are used to determine whether a given
        node is implicit:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>List, leaf-list and anyxml nodes are never implicit.</t>
          <t>A leaf node is implicit if and only if it has a default
          value, defined either directly or via its datatype.</t>
          <t>A container node is implicit if and only if it does not
          have the 'presence' substatement, none of its children are
          mandatory and at least one child is implicit.</t>
        </list></t>

        <t>In the hybrid schema, all implicit containers, as
        well as leafs that obtain their default value from a typedef
        and don't have the @nma:default attribute, MUST be marked with
        @nma:implicit attribute having the value of "true".</t>

        <t>Note that <eref
        target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-netmod-yang-10#section-7.9.3">Section
        7.9.3</eref> in <xref target="YANG"/> specifies other rules
        that must be taken into account when deciding whether a given
        container or leaf appearing inside a case of a choice is
        ultimately implicit or not. Specifically, a leaf or container
        under a case can be implicit only if the case appears in the
        argument of the choice's 'default' statement. However, this is
        not sufficient by itself but also depends on the particular
        instance XML document, namely on the presence or absence of
        nodes from other (non-default) cases. The details are
        explained in <xref target="mappingDSRL"/>.</t>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="grouping-typedef"
             title="Mapping YANG Groupings and Typedefs">

      <t>YANG groupings and typedefs are generally mapped to RELAX NG
      named patterns. There are, however, several caveats that the
      mapping has to take into account.</t>

      <t>First of all, YANG typedefs and groupings may appear at all
      levels of the module hierarchy and are subject to lexical
      scoping, see <eref
      target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-netmod-yang-10#section-5.5">
      Section 5.5</eref> in <xref target="YANG"/>. Second, top-level
      symbols from external modules may be imported as qualified names
      represented using the external module namespace prefix and the
      name of the symbol. In contrast, named patterns in RELAX NG
      (both local and imported via the &lt;rng:include&gt; pattern)
      share the same namespace and within a grammar they are always
      global - their definitions may only appear at the top level as
      children of the &lt;rng:grammar&gt; element. Consequently,
      whenever YANG groupings and typedefs are mapped to RELAX NG
      named pattern definitions, their names MUST be disambiguated in
      order to avoid naming conflicts. The mapping uses the following
      procedure for mangling the names of groupings and type
      definitions:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Names of groupings and typedefs appearing at the top level
        of the YANG module hierarchy are prefixed with the module name
        and two underscore characters ("__").</t>
        <t>Names of other groupings and typedefs, i.e., those that do
        not appear at the top level of a YANG module, are prefixed
        with the module name, double underscore, and then the names of
        all ancestor data nodes separated by double underscore.</t>
        <t>Finally, since the names of groupings and typedefs in YANG
        have different namespaces, an additional underscore character
        is added to the beginning of the mangled names of all
        groupings.</t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>An additional complication is caused by the YANG rules for
      subelement ordering (see, e.g., <eref
      target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-netmod-yang-13#section-7.5.7">Section
      7.5.7</eref> in <xref target="YANG"/>): In RPC input and output
      parameters, subelements must follow the order specified in the
      data model, otherwise the order is arbitrary. Consequently, if a
      grouping is used both in RPC input/output parameters and
      elsewhere, it MUST be mapped to two different named pattern
      definitions - one with fixed order and the other with arbitrary
      order. To distinguish them, the "__rpc" suffix MUST be appended
      to the version with fixed order.</t>

      <t>EXAMPLE. Consider the following YANG module which imports
      the standard module "ietf-inet-types" <xref target="Ytypes"/>:</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork>
<![CDATA[module example1 {
    namespace "http://example.com/ns/example1";
    prefix ex1;
    typedef vowels {
        type string {
            pattern "[aeiouy]*";
        }
    }
    grouping "grp1" {
        leaf "void" {
            type "empty";
        }
    }
    container "cont" {
        leaf foo {
            type vowels;
        }
        uses "grp1";
    }
}]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>The hybrid schema generated by the first mapping step will
      then contain the following two (global) named pattern
      definitions:</t>

      <figure>
        <artwork>
<![CDATA[<rng:define name="example1__vowels">

    <rng:element name="void">
      <rng:empty/>
    </rng:element>
  </rng:optional>
</rng:define>]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <section anchor="refine-augment" title="YANG Refinements and Augments">

        <t>YANG groupings represent a similar concept as named pattern
        definitions in RELAX NG and both languages also offer
        mechanisms for their subsequent modification. However, in
        RELAX NG the definitions themselves are modified whereas YANG
        provides two substatements of 'uses' which modify expansions
        of groupings:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>'refine' statement allows for changing parameters of a
          schema node inside the grouping referenced by the parent
          'uses' statement;</t>
          <t>'augment' statement can be used for adding new schema
          nodes to the grouping contents.</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>Both 'refine' and 'augment' statements are quite powerful
        in that they can address, using XPath-like expressions as
        their arguments, schema nodes that are arbitrarily deep inside
        the grouping contents. In contrast, modifications of named
        pattern definitions in RELAX NG are applied exclusively at the
        topmost level of the named pattern contents. In order to
        achieve a modifiability of named patterns comparable to YANG,
        a RELAX NG schema would have to be extremely flat (cf. <xref
        target="granularity"/>) and very difficult to read.</t>
        <t>Since the goal of the mapping described in this document is
        to generate ad hoc DSDL schemas, we decided to avoid these
        complications and instead expand the grouping and refine
        and/or augment it "in place". In other words, every 'uses'
        statement which has 'refine' and/or 'augment' substatements is
        replaced by the contents of the corresponding grouping, the
        changes specified in the 'refine' and 'augment' statements are
        applied and the resulting YANG schema fragment is mapped as if
        the 'uses'/'grouping' indirection wasn't there.</t>
        <t>If there are further 'uses' statements inside the grouping
        contents, they may require expansion, too: it is necessary if
        the contained 'uses'/'grouping' pair lies on the "modification
        path" specified in the argument of a 'refine' or 'augment'
        statement.</t>
      <t>EXAMPLE. Consider the following YANG module:</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork>
<![CDATA[module example2 {
    namespace "http://example.com/ns/example2";
    prefix ex2;
    grouping leaves {

    }
    grouping fr {
        leaf feuille {
            type string;
        }
    }
    grouping es {

            type string;
        }
    }
    uses leaves;
}]]></artwork>

      <t>The resulting hybrid schema contains three global named

      <t>The resulting hybrid schema now contains just one
      named pattern definition - "_example2__fr". The other two
      groupings "leaves" and "es" have to be expanded because they
      both lie on the "modification path", i.e., contain the leaf
      "hoja" that is being refined. The configuration data part of the
      hybrid schema now looks like this:</t>

      <section anchor="chtypes" title="Type Derivation Chains">
        <t>RELAX NG has no equivalent of the type derivation mechanism
        in YANG that allows to restrict a built-in type (perhaps in
        multiple steps) by adding new constraints. Whenever a derived
        YANG type is used without restrictions - as a substatement of
        either 'leaf' or another 'typedef' - then the 'type' statement
        is mapped simply to a named pattern reference &lt;rng:ref&gt;,
        and the type definition is mapped to a RELAX NG named pattern
        definition &lt;rng:define&gt;. However, if any restrictions
        are specified as substatements of the 'type' statement, the
        type definition MUST be expanded at that point so that only
        the ancestor built-in type appears in the hybrid schema,
        restricted with facets that correspond to the combination of
        all restrictions found along the type derivation chain and
        also in the 'type' statement.</t>
        <t>EXAMPLE. Consider this YANG module:</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork>
<![CDATA[module example3 {

    }
}]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>The 'type' statement in "leaf month" has no restrictions
        and is therefore mapped simply to the reference &lt;rng:ref

        <t>The output RELAX NG schema then will not contain any named

        </figure>

        <t>The mapping of type derivation chains may be further
        complicated by the presence of the 'default' statement in type
        definitions. In the simple case, when a type definition
        containing the 'default' statement is used without
        restrictions, the 'default' statement is mapped to the
        @nma:default attribute attached to the &lt;rng:define&gt;
        element.</t>
        <t>However, if that type definition has to be expanded due to
        restrictions, the @nma:default annotation arising from the
        expanded type or ancestor types in the type derivation chain
        MUST be attached to the pattern where the expansion occurs. If
        there are multiple 'default' statements in consecutive steps
        of the type derivation, only the 'default' statement that is
        closest to the expanded type is used.</t>
        <t>EXAMPLE. Consider this variation of the last example:</t>

        type uint8 {
            range 1..12;
        }
        default 7;
    }
    leaf month {
        type dozen;
    }
}]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>The 'typedef' statement in this module is mapped to the
        following named pattern definition:</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork>
<![CDATA[<rng:define name="example3bis__dozen" @nma:default="7">

    <rng:param name="maxInclusive">12</rng:param>
  </rng:data>
</rng:define>]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>If the "dozen" type is restricted when used in the leaf
        "month" definition as in the previous example, the "dozen"
        type has to be expanded and @nma:default becomes an attribute
        of the &lt;ex3bis:month&gt; element definition:</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork>
<![CDATA[<rng:element name="ex3bis:month" @nma:default="7">

        </figure>
        <t>However, if the definition of the leaf "month" itself
        contained the 'default' substatement, the default specified
        for the "dozen" type would be ignored.</t>

    <section anchor="transXPath"
             title="Translation of XPath Expressions">
      <t>YANG uses full XPath 1.0 syntax <xref target="XPath"/> for
      the arguments of 'must', 'when' and 'path' statements.  As the
      names of data nodes defined in a YANG module always belong to
      the namespace of that YANG module, YANG adopted a simplification
      similar to the concept of default namespace in XPath 2.0: node
      names in XPath expressions needn't carry a namespace prefix
      inside the module where they are defined and the local module's
      namespace is assumed.</t>
      <t>Consequently, all XPath expressions MUST be translated into a
      fully conformant XPath 1.0 expression: Every unprefixed node
      name MUST be prepended with the local module's namespace prefix
      as declared by the 'prefix' statement.</t>

      <t>XPath expressions appearing inside top-level groupings
      require special attention because all unprefixed node names
      contained in them must adopt the namespace of each module where
      the grouping is used (cf. <xref target="modularity"/>. In order
      to achieve this, the local prefix MUST be represented using the
      variable "$pref" in the hybrid schema. A Schematron schema which
      encounters such an XPath expression then supplies an appropriate
      value for this variable via a parameter to an abstract pattern
      to which the YANG grouping is mapped (see <xref
      target="mappingSch"/>).</t>

      <t>For example, XPath expression "/dhcp/max-lease-time"
      appearing in a YANG module with the "dhcp" prefix will be
      translated to
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>"$pref:dhcp/$pref:max-lease-time", if the expression is
        inside a top-level grouping;</t>
        <t>"dhcp:dhcp/dhcp:max-lease-time", otherwise.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>YANG also uses other XPath-like expressions, namely key
      identifiers and "descendant schema node identifiers" (see the
      ABNF production for and "descendant-schema-nodeid" in <eref
      target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-netmod-yang-10#section-12">Section&#xA0;12</eref>
      of <xref target="YANG"/>). These expressions MUST be translated
      by adding local module prefixes as well.</t>
    </section>

  <section anchor="extensions" title="YANG Language Extensions">
    <t>YANG allows for extending its own language in-line by adding
    new statements with keywords from special namespaces. Such
    extensions first have to be declared using the 'extension'
    statement and then they can be used as the standard YANG
    statements, from which they are distinguished by a namespace
    prefix qualifying the extension keyword. RELAX NG has a similar
    extension mechanism - XML elements and attributes with names from
    foreign namespaces may be inserted at almost any place of a RELAX
    NG schema.</t>
    <t>YANG language extensions may or may not have a meaning in the
    context of DSDL schemas. Therefore, an implementation MAY ignore
    any or all of the extensions. However, an extension that is not
    ignored MUST be mapped to XML element(s) and/or attribute(s) that
    exactly match the YIN form of the extension, see <eref
    target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-netmod-yang-11#section-11.1">Section
    11.1</eref> in <xref
    target="YANG"/>.</t>

    <t>EXAMPLE. Consider the following extension defined by the "acme"
    module:</t>
    <figure>
      <artwork>
<![CDATA[extension documentation-flag {
    argument number;
}]]></artwork>
    </figure>
    <t>This extension can then be used in the same or another
    module, for instance like this:</t>
    <figure>
      <artwork>
<![CDATA[leaf folio {
    acme:documentation-flag 42;
    type string;

  <section anchor="yang-to-rng"
           title="Mapping YANG Statements to the Hybrid Schema">

    <t>Each subsection in this section is devoted to one YANG
    statement and provides the specification of how the statement is
    mapped to the hybrid schema. The subsections are sorted
    alphabetically by the statement keyword.</t>
    <t>Each YANG statement is mapped to an XML fragment, typically a
    single element or attribute but it may also be a larger
    structure. The mapping procedure is inherently recursive, which
    means that after finishing a statement the mapping continues with
    its substatements, if there are any, and a certain element of the
    resulting fragment becomes the parent of other fragments resulting
    from the mapping of substatements. Any changes to this default
    recursive procedure are explicitly specified.</t>
    <t>YANG XML encoding rules translate to the following rules for
    ordering multiple subelements:
    <list style="numbers">
      <t>Within the &lt;nma:rpcs&gt; subtree (i.e., for input and
      output parameters of an RPC operation) the order of subelements
      is fixed and their definitions in the hybrid schema MUST follow
      the order specified in the source YANG module.</t>

      <t>When mapping the 'list' statement, all keys MUST come before
      any other subelements and in the same order as they are declared
      in the 'key' statement. The order of the remaining (non-key)
      subelements is not specified, so their definitions in the hybrid
      schema MUST be enclosed in the &lt;rng:interleave&gt;
      element.</t>

      <t>Otherwise, the order of subelements is arbitrary and,
      consequently, all definitions of subelements in the hybrid
      schema MUST be enclosed in the &lt;rng:interleave&gt;
      element.</t>
    </list></t>

    <t>The following conventions are used in this section:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>The argument of the statement being mapped is denoted by
      ARGUMENT.</t>
      <t>The element in the RELAX NG schema that becomes the parent of

      <t>When mapping the substatements of 'list', the order of

      grouping, and the position of the 'uses' statement would violate
      the above ordering requirement, the grouping MUST be expanded,

        <t>An exception is the "decimal64" type, which is

      <section anchor="derived-types" title="Derived Types">
        <t>If the 'type' statement refers to a derived type, it is
        mapped in one of the following ways depending on whether it
        contains any restrictions as its substatements:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Without restrictions, the 'type' statement is mapped
          simply to the &lt;rng:ref&gt; element, i.e., a reference to
          a named pattern. If the RELAX NG definition of this named
          pattern has not been added to the hybrid schema yet, the
          corresponding type definition MUST be found and its mapping
          installed as a subelement of either the root or an embedded
          &lt;rng:grammar&gt; element, see <xref
          target="typedef-stmt"/>. Even if a given derived type is
          used more than once in the input YANG modules, the mapping
          of the corresponding 'typedef' MUST be installed only
          once.</t>
          <t>If any restrictions are present, the ancestor built-in
          type for the given derived type must be determined and the
          mapping of this base type MUST be used. Restrictions
          appearing at all stages of the type derivation chain MUST be
          taken into account and their conjunction added to the
          &lt;rng:data&gt; element which defines the basic type.</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>See <xref target="chtypes"/> for more details and an
        example.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="typedef-stmt" title="The typedef Statement">
      <t>This statement is mapped to a RELAX NG named pattern definition
      &lt;rng:define&gt;, but only if the type defined by this
      statement is used without restrictions in at least one of the
      input modules. In this case, the named pattern definition
      becomes a child of either the root or an embedded
      &lt;rng:grammar&gt; element, depending on whether the 'typedef'
      statement appears at the top level of a YANG module or not.  The
      name of this named pattern definition is set to ARGUMENT mangled
      according to the rules specified in <xref
      target="grouping-typedef"/>.</t>
      <t>Whenever a derived type is used with additional restrictions,
      the ancestor built-in type for the derived type is used instead with
      restrictions (facets) that are a combination of all restrictions
      specified along the type derivation chain. See <xref
      target="derived-types"/> for further details and an example.</t>
      <t>An implementation MAY offer the option of recording all
      'typedef' statements as named patterns in the output RELAX NG
      schema even if they are not referenced. This is useful for
      mapping YANG "library" modules containing only 'typedef' and/or

      translation then becomes the value of the @nma:unique

  <section anchor="hs-to-dsdl"
           title="Mapping the Hybrid Schema to DSDL">
    
  <t>As explained in <xref target="mappingOverview"/>, the second step
  of the YANG-to-DSDL mapping takes the hybrid schema and transforms
  it to various DSDL schemas capable of validating instance XML
  documents. As an input parameter, this step takes, in the simplest
  case, just a specification of the NETCONF XML document type that is
  to be validated. These document types can be, for example, the
  contents of a datastore, a reply to &lt;nc:get&gt; or
  &lt;nc:get-config&gt;, contents of other RPC requests/replies and
  event notifications, and so on.</t>
  <t>In general, the second mapping step has to accomplish the
  following three tasks:
  <list style="numbers">
    <t>Extract the parts of the hybrid schema that are
    appropriate for the requested document type. For example, if a
    &lt;nc:get&gt; reply is to be validated, the subtree under
    &lt;nma:data&gt; has to be selected.</t>
    <t>The schema must be adapted to the specific encapsulating
    XML elements mandated by the RPC layer. These are, for example,
    &lt;nc:rpc&gt; and &lt;nc:data&gt; elements in the case of a
    &lt;nc:get&gt; reply or &lt;en:notification&gt; for a notification.</t>
    <t>Finally, NETMOD-specific annotations that are relevant for the
    schema language of the generated schema must be mapped to the
    corresponding patterns or rules.</t>
  </list></t>
  <t>These three tasks are together much simpler than the first
  mapping step and can be effectively implemented using XSL
  transformations <xref target="XSLT"/>.</t>
  <t>The following subsections describe the details of the second
  mapping step for the individual DSDL schema languages. <xref
  target="nma-to-dsdl"/> then contains a detailed specification for
  the mapping of all NETMOD-specific annotations.</t>

  <section anchor="step2-rng"
           title="Generating RELAX NG Schemas for Various Document Types">
    <t>With one minor exception, obtaining a validating RELAX NG
    schema from the hybrid schema only means taking appropriate parts
    of the hybrid schema and assembling them in a new RELAX NG
    grammar, perhaps after removing all unwanted annotations.</t>
    <t>The structure of the resulting RELAX NG schema is similar to
    that of the hybrid schema: The root grammar contains embedded
    grammars, one for each input YANG module. However, as explained in
    <xref target="modularity"/>, global named pattern definitions
    (children of the root &lt;rng:grammar&gt; element) MUST be moved
    to a separate schema file.</t>
    <t>Depending on the XML document type that is the target
    for validation, such as &lt;nc:get&gt;/&lt;nc:get-config&gt; reply, RPC
    operations or notifications, patterns defining corresponding
    top-level information items MUST be added, such as
    &lt;nc:rpc-reply&gt; with the @message-id attribute and so on.</t>

    <t>In order to avoid copying common named pattern definitions for
    common NETCONF elements and attributes to every single output
    RELAX NG file, such schema-independent definitions SHOULD be
    collected in a library file which is then included by the
    validating RELAX NG schemas. <xref target="app-library"/> has the
    listing of such a library file.</t>

    <t>The minor exception mentioned above is the annotation
    @nma:config, which must be observed if the target document type is
    a reply to &lt;nc:get-config&gt;. In this case, each element
    definition that has this attribute with the value of "false" MUST
    be removed from the schema together with its descendants. See
    <xref target="nma-config"/> for more details.</t>

  </section>

  <section anchor="mappingSch"
           title="Mapping Semantic Constraints to Schematron">

    <t>Schematron schemas tend to be much flatter and more uniform
    compared to RELAX NG. They have exactly four levels of XML
    hierarchy: &lt;sch:schema&gt;, &lt;sch:pattern&gt;,
    &lt;sch:rule&gt; and &lt;sch:assert&gt; or &lt;sch:report&gt;.</t>
    <t>In a Schematron schema generated by the second mapping step,
    the basic unit of organization is a rule represented by the
    &lt;sch:rule&gt; element. The following NETMOD-specific
    annotations from the hybrid schema (henceforth called "semantic
    annotations") are mapped to corresponding Schematron rules:
    &lt;nma:must&gt;, @nma:key, @nma:unique, @nma:max-elements,
    @nma:min-elements, @nma:when, @nma:leafref, @nma:leaf-list, and
    also @nma:mandatory appearing as an attribute of
    &lt;rng:choice&gt; (see <xref target="mandatory-choice"/>).</t>

    <t>Each input YANG module is mapped to a Schematron pattern whose
    @id attribute is set to the module name. Every &lt;rng:element&gt;
    pattern containing at least one of the above-mentioned semantic
    annotations is then mapped to a Schematron rule:</t>

    <figure>
      <artwork>
<![CDATA[<sch:rule context="XELEM">
  ...
</sch:rule>]]></artwork>
    </figure>

    <t>The value of the mandatory @context attribute of
    &lt;sch:rule&gt; (denoted as XELEM) MUST be set to the absolute
    path of the context element in the data tree. The &lt;sch:rule&gt;
    element contains the mappings of all contained semantic
    annotations in the form of Schematron asserts or reports.</t>

    <t>Semantic annotations appearing inside a named pattern
    definition (i.e., having &lt;rng:define&gt; among its ancestors)
    require special treatment because they may be potentially used in
    different contexts. This is accomplished by using Schematron
    abstract patterns that use the "$pref" variable in place of the
    local namespace prefix. The value of the @id attribute of such an
    abstract pattern MUST be set to the name of the named pattern
    definition which is being mapped (i.e., the mangled name of the
    original YANG grouping).</t>
    <t>When the abstract pattern is instantiated,
    the values of the following two parameters MUST be provided:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>pref: the actual namespace prefix,</t>
      <t>start: XPath expression defining the context in which the
      grouping is used.</t>
    </list></t>

    <t>EXAMPLE. Consider the following YANG module:</t>

    <figure>
      <artwork>
<![CDATA[module example4 {
  namespace "http://example.com/ns/example4";
  prefix ex4;
  uses sorted-leaf-list;
  grouping sorted-leaf-list {
    leaf-list sorted-entry {
      must "not(preceding-sibling::sorted-entry > .)" {
        error-message "Entries must appear in ascending order.";
      }
      type uint8;
    }
  }
}]]></artwork>
    </figure>

    <t>The resulting Schematron schema for a reply to &lt;nc:get&gt;
    is then as follows:</t>

<figure>
      <artwork>
<![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

        Duplicate leaf-list entry "<sch:value-of select="."/>".
      </sch:report>
      <sch:assert
          test="not(preceding-sibling::$pref:sorted-entry &gt; .)">
        Entries must appear in ascending order.

    <sch:param name="pref" value="ex4"/>
  </sch:pattern>
</sch:schema>]]></artwork>
    </figure>

    <t>The "sorted-leaf-list" grouping from the input module is mapped
    to an abstract pattern with an @id value of
    "_example4__sorted-leaf-list" in which the 'must' statement
    corresponds to the &lt;sch:assert&gt; element. The abstract
    pattern is the instantiated by the pattern with an @id value of
    "id2802112" which sets the "start" and "pref" parameters to
    appropriate values.</t>

    <t>Note that another Schematron element, &lt;sch:report&gt;, was
    automatically added, checking for duplicate leaf-list entries.</t>

    <t>The mapping from the hybrid schema to Schematron
    proceeds in the following steps:
    <list style="numbers">
      <t>First, the active subtree(s) of the hybrid schema
      must be selected depending on the requested target document
      type. This procedure is identical to the RELAX NG case,
      including the handling of @nma:config if
      the target document type is &lt;nc:get-config&gt; reply.</t>
      <t>Namespaces of all input YANG modules, together with the
      namespaces of base NETCONF ("nc" prefix) or notifications ("en"
      prefix) MUST be declared using the &lt;sch:ns&gt;
      element, for example
      <figure>
        <artwork>
<![CDATA[<sch:ns uri="http://example.com/ns/example4" prefix="ex4"/>]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      </t>
      <t>One pattern is created for every input module. In addition,
      an abstract pattern is created for every named pattern
      definition containing one or more semantic annotations.</t>
      <t>A &lt;sch:rule&gt; element is created for each element
      pattern containing semantic annotations.</t> <t>Every such
      annotation is then mapped to an &lt;sch:assert&gt; or
      &lt;sch:report&gt; element which is installed as a child of the
      &lt;sch:rule&gt; element.</t>
    </list></t>

  <section anchor="mandatory-choice"
           title="Constraints on Mandatory Choice">

    <t>In order to fully represent the semantics of YANG's 'choice'
    statement with the "mandatory true;" substatement, the RELAX NG
    grammar has to be combined with a special Schematron rule.</t>
    <t>EXAMPLE. Consider the following module:</t>
    <figure>
      <artwork>
<![CDATA[module example5 {
    namespace "http://example.com/ns/example5";
    prefix ex5;
    choice foobar {
        mandatory true;
        case foo {
            leaf foo1 {
                type uint8;
            }
            leaf foo2 {
                type uint8;
            }
        }
        leaf bar {
            type uint8;
        }
    }
}]]></artwork>
    </figure>
    <t>In this module, all three leaf nodes in both case branches are
    optional but because of the "mandatory true;" statement, at least
    one of them must be present in a valid configuration. The 'choice'
    statement from this module is mapped to the following fragment of
    the RELAX NG schema:</t>
    <figure>
      <artwork>
<![CDATA[<rng:choice>
  <rng:interleave>
    <rng:optional>
      <rng:element name="ex5:foo1">
        <rng:data type="unsignedByte"/>
      </rng:element>
    </rng:optional>
    <rng:optional>
      <rng:element name="ex5:foo2">
        <rng:data type="unsignedByte"/>
      </rng:element>
    </rng:optional>
  </rng:interleave>
  <rng:element name="ex5:bar">
    <rng:data type="unsignedByte"/>
  </rng:element>
</rng:choice>]]></artwork>
    </figure>
    <t>In the second case branch, the "ex5:bar" element is defined as
    mandatory so that this element must be present in a valid
    configuration if this branch is selected. However, the two
    elements in the first branch "foo" cannot be both declared as
    mandatory since each of them alone suffices for a valid
    configuration. As a result, the above RELAX NG fragment would
    successfully validate configurations where none of the three leaf
    elements are present.</t>

    <t>Therefore, mandatory choices, which can be recognized in the
    hybrid schema as &lt;rng:choice&gt; elements with the
    @nma:mandatory annotation, have to be handled in a special way:
    For each mandatory choice where at least one of the cases contains
    more than one node, a Schematron rule MUST be added enforcing the
    presence of at least one element from any of the cases. (RELAX NG
    schema guarantees that elements from different cases cannot be
    mixed together, that all mandatory nodes are present etc.).</t>
    <t>For the example module above, the Schematron rule will be as
    follows:</t>
    <figure>
      <artwork>
<![CDATA[<sch:rule context="/nc:rpc-reply/nc:data">
  <sch:assert test="ex5:foo1 or ex5:foo2 or ex5:bar">
    Node(s) from at least one case of choice "foobar" must exist.
  </sch:assert>
</sch:rule>]]></artwork>

  <section anchor="mappingDSRL"
           title="Mapping Default Values to DSRL">

    <t>DSRL is the only component of DSDL which is allowed to change
    the information set of the validated XML document. While DSRL also
    has other functions, YANG-to-DSDL mapping uses it only for
    specifying and applying default contents. For XML instance
    documents based on YANG data models, insertion of default contents
    may potentially take place for all implicit nodes identified by
    the rules in <xref target="implicit-nodes"/>.</t>

    <t>In DSRL, the default contents of an element are specified using
    the &lt;dsrl:default-content&gt; element, which is a child of
    &lt;dsrl:element-map&gt;. Two sibling elements of
    &lt;dsrl:default-content&gt; determine the context for the
    application of the default contents, see <xref target="DSRL"/>:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>&lt;dsrl:parent&gt; element contains an XSLT pattern
      specifying the parent element; the default contents are applied
      only if the parent element exists in the instance document.</t>
      <t>&lt;dsrl:name&gt; contains the XML name of the element which,
      if missing or empty, is inserted together with the contents of
      &lt;dsrl:default-content&gt;.</t>
    </list></t>

    <t>The &lt;dsrl:parent&gt; element is optional in a general DSRL
    schema but, for the purpose of the YANG-to-DSDL mapping, this
    element MUST be always present, in order to guarantee a proper
    application of default contents.</t>

    <t>DSRL mapping only deals with &lt;rng:element&gt; patterns in
    the hybrid schema that define implicit nodes (see <xref
    target="implicit-nodes"/>). Such element patterns are
    distinguished by having NETMOD-specific annotation attributes
    @nma:default or @nma:implicit, i.e., either</t>

    <figure>
      <artwork>
<![CDATA[<rng:element name="ELEM" nma:default="DEFVALUE">
  ...
</rng:element>]]></artwork>
    </figure>

    <t>or</t>

    <figure>
      <artwork>
<![CDATA[<rng:element name="ELEM" nma:implicit="true">
  ...
</rng:element>]]></artwork>
    </figure>

    <t>The former case applies to leaf nodes having the 'default'
    substatement, but also to leaf nodes that obtain their default
    value from a typedef, if this typedef is expanded according to the
    rules in <xref target="chtypes"/> so that the @nma:default
    annotation is attached directly to the leaf's element pattern.</t>

    <t>The latter case is used for all implicit containers (see <xref
    target="occurrence-rules"/>) and for leafs that obtain the default
    value from a typedef and don't have the @nma:default annotation.</t>

    <t>In the simplest case, both element patterns are mapped to the
    following DSRL element map:</t>

    <figure>
      <artwork>
<![CDATA[<dsrl:element-map>
  <dsrl:parent>XPARENT</dsrl:parent>
  <dsrl:name>ELEM</dsrl:name>
  <dsrl:default-content>DEFCONT</dsrl:default-content>
</dsrl:element-map>]]></artwork>
    </figure>
    <t>where XPARENT is the absolute XPath of ELEM's parent element in
    the data tree and DEFCONT is constructed as follows:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>If the implicit node ELEM is a leaf and has the @nma:default
      attribute, DEFCONT is set to the value of this attribute
      (denoted above as DEFVALUE).</t>
      <t>If the implicit node ELEM is a leaf and has the @nma:implicit
      attribute with the value of "true", the default value has to be
      determined from the @nma:default attribute of the definition of
      ELEM's type (perhaps recursively) and used in place of DEFCONT
      in the above DSRL element map. See also <xref
      target="chtypes"/>.</t>
      <t>Otherwise, the implicit node ELEM is a container and DEFCONT
      is constructed as an XML fragment containing all descendant
      elements of ELEM that have either @nma:implicit or @nma:default
      attribute.</t>
    </list></t>

    <t>In addition, when mapping the default case of a choice, it has
    to be guaranteed that the default contents are not applied if any
    node from any non-default case is present. This is accomplished by
    setting &lt;dsrl:parent&gt; in a special way:</t>

    <figure>
      <artwork>
<![CDATA[<dsrl:parent>XPARENT[not (ELEM1|ELEM2|...|ELEMn)]</dsrl:parent>]]></artwork>
    </figure>

    <t>where ELEM1, ELEM2, ... ELEMn are the names of all top-level
    nodes from all non-default cases. The rest of the element map is
    exactly as before.</t>

    <t>EXAMPLE. Consider the following YANG module:</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork>
<![CDATA[module example6 {
  namespace "http://example.com/ns/example6";
  prefix ex6;
  container outer {
    leaf leaf1 {
      type uint8;
      default 1;
    }
    choice one-or-two {
      default "one";
      container one {
        leaf leaf2 {
          type uint8;
          default 2;
        }
      }
      leaf leaf3 {
        type uint8;
        default 3;
      }
    }
  }
}]]></artwork>

    datastores and thus provide additional validity checks above those
    performed by NETCONF server and client implementations supporting
    YANG data models. The strictness of this validation is directly
    derived from the source YANG modules that the validated XML data
    adhere to.</t>

    <t>This appendix demonstrates both steps of the
    YANG-to-DSDL mapping applied to the "canonical" <eref
    target="http://www.yang-central.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/DhcpTutorial">DHCP
    tutorial</eref> data model. The single input YANG module is
    shown in <xref target="app-dhcp-yang"/> and the output schemas in
    the following two subsections.</t>
    <t>The hybrid schema was obtained by the "dsdl" plugin of the
    <eref target="http://code.google.com/p/pyang/">pyang</eref> tool
    and the validating DSDL schemas obtained by XSLT stylesheets that
    are also part of pyang distribution.</t>
    <t>Due to the limit of 72 characters per line, a few long strings
    required manual editing, in particular the regular expression
    patterns for IP addresses etc. These were replaced by the
    placeholder string "... regex pattern ...". Also, line breaks were
    added to several documentation strings and Schematron
    messages. Other than that, the results of the automatic
    translations were not changed.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>Terminology change: "conceptual tree schema" -> "hybrid
        schema".</t>
        <t>Changed sectioning markers in the hybrid schema into plain
        NETMOD-specific annotations. Hence the former "nmt" namespace
        is not used at all.</t>
        <t>Added the following NETMOD-specific annotations:
        @nma:if-feature, @nma:leaf-list, @nma:mandatory,
        @nma:module, removed @nma:presence.</t>
        <t>Changed the structure of RELAX NG schemas by using embedded
        grammars and declaration of namespaces via @ns. This was
        necessary for enabling the "chameleon" behavior of global
        definitions.</t>
        <t>Schematron validation phases are not used.</t>
        <t>If an XPath expression appears inside a top-level grouping,
        the local prefix must be represented using the variable
        $pref. (This is related to the previous item.)</t>
        <t>DHCP example: All RNG schemas are only in the XML
        syntax. Added RNG with global definitions.</t>
        <t>Added <xref target="XML-INFOSET"/> to normative references.</t>
        <t>Listed the terms that are defined in other documents.</t>
        <t>The schema for NETMOD-specific annotation is now given only
        as RNG named pattern definitions, no more in NVDL.</t>
      </list></t>

    <section title="Changes Between Versions -04 and -05">

        <t>Removed NS prefix from document element name of the DOCTYPE

    <section title="Changes Between Versions -04 and -05">
      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>Leafs that take their default value from a typedef and are
        not annotated with @nma:default must have
        @nma:implicit="true".</t>
        <t>Changed code markers CODE BEGINS/ENDS to the form agreed by
        the WG.</t>
        <t>Derived types "date-and-time" and "uri" SHOULD be mapped to
        XSD "dateTime" and "anyURI" types, respectively.</t>
        <t>Clarified the notion of implicit nodes under under 'case'
        in <xref target="implicit-nodes"/>.</t>
        <t>Moved draft-ietf-netmod-yang-types-06 to normative
        references.</t>
        <t>An extra &lt;rng:group&gt; is no more required for the
        default case of a choice in the shorthand notation.</t>

    <section title="Changes Between Versions -03 and -04">
      <t><list style="symbols">

        <t>Implemented ordering rules for list children - keys must go
        first and appear in the same order as in the input YANG
        module.</t>
        <t>The 'case' statement is now mapped to either
        &lt;rng:group&gt; (inside RPC operations) or &lt;rng:interleave&gt;
        (otherwise).</t>
        <t>A nma:default annotation coming from a datatype which the mapping
        expands is attached to the &lt;rng:element&gt; pattern where
        the expansion occurs. Added an example.</t>
        <t>Documentation statements ('description', 'reference',
        'status') MAY be ignored.</t>
        <t>Single-valued numeric or length range parts are mapped to
        &lt;rng:value&gt; pattern or "length" facet.</t>
        <t>Example for "string" datatype was added.</t>
        <t><xref target="nma-schema"/> now uses NVDL for defining
        NETMOD-specific annotations.</t>
        <t>Added CODE BEGINS/ENDS markers.</t>
        <t>Separated normative and informative references.</t>
        <t>Added URL for XPath extensions namespace.</t>
        <t>Added <xref target="term-not"/> (Terminology and Notation).</t>
        <t>Added <xref target="sec-cons"/> (Security
        Considerations).</t>

        <t>Added section on 'feature' and 'deviation'.</t>
        <t>New <xref target="occurrence-rules"/> integrating discussion

        <t>Reflected that key argument and schema node identifiers are

        <t>Element patterns for implicit containers now must have
        @nma:implicit attribute.</t>

        <t>Finished the DHCP example by adding the DSRL schema to

        explicit prefix to all defined elements and
        attributes. Previously, the attributes had no namespace.</t>

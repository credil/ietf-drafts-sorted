Internet-Draft                   HICCUPS                       July 2010


1.  Introduction

   Two hosts can use HIP [RFC5201] to establish a Security Association
   (SA) between them in order to exchange arbitrary protocol messages
   over that security association.  The establishment of such a security
   association involves a four-way handshake referred to as the HIP base
   exchange.  When handling communications between the hosts, HIP
   supports mobility, multihoming, security, and NAT traversal.  Some
   applications require these features for their communications but
   cannot accept the overhead involved in establishing a security
   association (i.e., the HIP base exchange) before those communications
   can start.

   In this document, we define the HIP DATA packet, which can be used to
   convey (in a authenticated and reliable way) protocol messages to a
   remote host without running the HIP base exchange between them.  The
   HIP DATA packet has following semantics: unordered, duplicate free,
   reliable, and authenticated message-based delivery service.  We also
   discuss the trade offs involved in using this packet (i.e., less
   overhead but also less DoS protection) and the situations where it is
   appropriate to use this packet.  The HIP_DATA packet is not intended
   to be a replacement for the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
   transport instead it SHOULD NOT be used to exchange more than a few
   packets between the peers.  If a continuous communication is required
   or communication that requires confidentiality protection then hosts
   MUST run the HIP base exchange to set up ESP security association.
   Additionally APIs to higher-level protocols that might use this
   service are outside of the scope of this document.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
   In addition this document uses the terms defined in [RFC5201].

   Message Integrity Code (MIC)  is a collision-resistant hash sum
      calculated over the message which is being integrity protected.
      The MIC does not use secret keys and thus it needs additional
      means to ensure that it has not been tampered with during
      transmission.  Essentially MIC is same as Message Authentication
      Code (MAC) with the distinction that MIC does not use secret key.
      MIC is also often referred as Integrity Check Value (ICV),
      fingerprint, or unkeyed MAC.

3.  Background on HIP

   The HIP protocol specification [RFC5201] defines a number of messages
   and parameters.  The parameters are encoded as TLVs, as shown in
   Section 3.1.2.  Furthermore, the HIP header carries a Next Header
   field, allowing other arbitrary packets to be carried within HIP
   packets.

3.1.  Message formats

3.1.1.  HIP fixed header

   The HIP packet format consists of a fixed header followed by a
   variable number of parameters.  The parameter format is described in
   Section 3.1.2.

   The fixed header is defined in Section 5.1 of [RFC5201] and copied
   below.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The HIP header is logically an IPv6 extension header.  The HIP
   protocol specification [RFC5201] defines handling only for Next
   Header value decimal 59, IPPROTO_NONE [PROTOCOL-NUMBERS], the IPv6
   'no next header' value.  This document describes processing for Next
   Header values other than decimal 59 which indicates that there are
   either more extensions header and/or data following the HIP header.

   The HIP parameter format is defined in Section 5.2.1 of [RFC5201],
   and copied below.

                    The C bit is considered to be a part of the Type
                    field.  Consequently, critical parameters are always
                    odd and non-critical ones have an even value.

3.2.  HIP Base Exchange, Updates, and State Removal

   The HIP base exchange is a four-message authentication and key
   exchange protocol that creates shared, mutually authenticated keying
   material at the communicating parties.  These keying materials,
   together with associated public keys and IP addresses, form a HIP
   Security Association (SA).  The details of the protocol are defined
   in the HIP base exchange specification [RFC5201].

   In addition to creating the HIP SA, the base exchange messages may
   carry additional parameters that are used to create additional state.
   For example, the HIP ESP specification [RFC5202] defines how HIP can
   be used to create end-to-end, host-to-host IPsec ESP Security
   Associations, used to carry data packets.  However, it is important
   to understand that the HIP base exchange is by no means bound to
   IPsec; using IPsec ESP to carry data traffic forms just a baseline
   and ensures interoperability between initial HIP implementations.

   Once there is a HIP SA between two HIP-enabled hosts, they can
   exchange further HIP control messages.  Typically, UPDATE messages
   are used.  For example, the HIP mobility and multihoming



Camarillo & Melen       Expires January 13, 2011                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                   HICCUPS                       July 2010


   specification [RFC5206] defines how to use UPDATE messages to change
   the set of IP addresses associated with a HIP SA.

   In addition to the base exchange and updates, the HIP base protocol
   specification also defines how one can remove a HIP SA once it is no
   longer needed.


4.  Definition of the HIP DATA Packet

   The HIP DATA packet can be used to convey protocol messages to a
   remote host without running the HIP base exchange between them.  HIP
   DATA packets are transmitted reliably, as discussed in Section 5.
   The payload of a HIP DATA packet is placed after the HIP header and
   protected by a PAYLOAD_MIC parameter, which is defined in
   Section 4.3.  The following is the definition of the HIP DATA packet
   (see definition of notation in [RFC5201] section 2.2):


      Header:
        Packet Type = [ TBD by IANA: 32 ]
        SRC HIT = Sender's HIT
        DST HIT = Receiver's HIT

    IP ( HIP ( [HOST_ID, ] SEQ_DATA, PAYLOAD_MIC,  [ PAYLOAD_MIC, ..., ]
               HIP_SIGNATURE) PAYLOAD )

    IP ( HIP ( [HOST_ID, ] SEQ_DATA, ACK_DATA, PAYLOAD_MIC,
               [ PAYLOAD_MIC, ..., ] HIP_SIGNATURE) PAYLOAD )

    IP ( HIP ( [HOST_ID, ] ACK_DATA, HIP_SIGNATURE))

   The SEQ_DATA and ACK_DATA parameters are defined in Section 4.1 and
   Section 4.2 respectively.  They are used to provide a reliable
   delivery of HIP DATA packets, as discussed in Section 5.

   The HOST_ID parameter is defined in Section 5.2.8 of [RFC5201].  This
   parameter is the sender's Host Identifier that is used to compute the
   HIP DATA packet's signature and to verify it against the received
   signature.  The HOST_ID parameter is optional as it MAY have been
   delivered using out-of-band mechanism to the receiver.  If host
   doesn't have reliable information that the corresponding node has its
   HOST_ID it MUST always include it in to the packet.  If the receiver
   is unable to verify the SIGNATURE then the packet MUST be dropped and
   appropriate NOTIFY packet SHOULD be sent to the sender indicating
   AUTHENTICATION_FAILED as described in [RFC5201] section 5.2.16.

   The PAYLOAD_MIC parameter is defined in Section 4.3.  This parameter

   contains the MIC of the payload carried by the HIP DATA packet.  The
   PAYLOAD_MIC contains the collision-resistant hash of the payload
   following after the HIP DATA.  The PAYLOAD_MIC is included in the
   signed part of the HIP DATA packet giving integrity protection also
   for the payload carried after HIP DATA packet.

   The HIP_SIGNATURE parameter is defined in Section 5.2.11. of
   [RFC5201].  It contains a signature over the contents of the HIP DATA
   packet.  The calculation and verification of the signature is defined
   Section 6.4.2. of [RFC5201]

   Section 5.3 of [RFC5201] states the following:

      In the future, an OPTIONAL upper-layer payload MAY follow the HIP
      header.  The Next Header field in the header indicates if there is
      additional data following the HIP header.

   We have chosen to place the payload after the HIP extension header
   and only to place an MIC of the payload in to the HIP extension
   header in a PAYLOAD_MIC parameter because that way the data integrity
   is protected by a public key signature with the help of MIC.  The
   payload that is protected by the PAYLOAD_MIC parameter has been
   linked to the appropriate upper-layer protocol by storing the upper-
   layer protocol number, 8 octets of payload data, and by calculating a
   hash sum (MIC) over the data.  The HIP DATA packet MAY contain one or
   more PAYLOAD_MIC parameters each bound to different next header type.
   The hash algorithm used to generate MIC is same as the algorithm used
   to generate the Host Identity Tag [RFC5201].

   Upper-layer protocol messages, such as overlay network control
   traffic, sent in HIP DATA messages may need to be matched to
   different transactions.  For this purpose, a DATA message MAY also
   contain a TRANSACTION_ID parameter.  The identifier value is a
   variable length bit string in network-byte-order that is unique for
   each transaction.  A response to a request uses the same identifier
   value allowing the receiver to match requests to responses.

4.1.  Definition of the SEQ_DATA Parameter

   The following is the definition of the SEQ_DATA parameter:

   This parameter has critical bit set and if it is not supported by the
   receiver packet MUST be dropped and appropriate NOTIFY packet SHOULD
   be sent to the sender indicating UNSUPPORTED_CRITICAL_PARAMETER_TYPE
   as described in [RFC5201] section 5.2.16.

5.  Generation and Reception of HIP DATA Packets

   HIP DATA packets are transmitted reliably.  Reliable delivery is
   achieved through the use of retransmissions and of the SEQ_DATA and
   ACK_DATA parameters.

5.1.  Handling of SEQ_DATA and ACK_DATA

   A HIP DATA packet MUST contain at least one of a SEQ_DATA or an
   ACK_DATA parameter; if both parameters are missing, then packet MUST
   be dropped as invalid.

   A HIP DATA packet containing SEQ_DATA parameter MUST contain one or
   more PAYLOAD_MIC parameter or otherwise packet MUST be dropped.  The
   presence of a SEQ_DATA parameter indicates that the receiver MUST ACK
   the HIP DATA packet.  A HIP DATA packet that does not contain a
   SEQ_DATA parameter is simply an ACK of a previous HIP DATA packet and
   MUST NOT be ACKed.

   A HIP DATA packet containing ACK_DATA parameter echoes the SEQ_DATA
   sequence numbers of the HIP DATA packet packets being acknowledged.
   ACK_DATA parameter MUST acknowledge at least one SEQ_DATA sequence
   number and MAY acknowledge multiple SEQ_DATA sequence numbers by

   adding all of them to the ACK_DATA parameter

   A HIP DATA packet MAY contain both a SEQ_DATA and an ACK_DATA
   parameter.  In this case, the ACK is being piggybacked on an outgoing
   HIP DATA packet.  In general, HIP DATA packets carrying SEQ_DATA
   SHOULD be ACKed upon completion of the processing of the HIP DATA
   packet.  A host MAY choose to hold the HIP DATA packet carrying ACK
   for a short period of time to allow for the possibility of
   piggybacking the ACK parameter, in a manner similar to TCP delayed
   acknowledgments.

5.2.  Generation of a HIP DATA packet

   When a host has upper-layer protocol data to send, it either runs the
   HIP base exchange and sends the data over a SA, or sends the data
   directly using a HIP DATA packet.  Section 6 discusses when it is
   appropriate to use each method.  This section discusses the case when
   the host chooses to use a HIP DATA packet to send the upper-layer
   protocol data.

   1.  The host creates a HIP DATA packet that contains a SEQ_DATA
       parameter.  The host is free to choose any value for the SEQ_DATA
       sequence number in the first HIP DATA packet it sends to a
       destination.  After that first packet, the host MUST choose the
       value of the SEQ_DATA sequence number in subsequent HIP DATA
       packets to the same destination so that no SEQ_DATA sequence
       number is reused before the receiver has closed the processing
       window for the previous packet using the same SEQ_DATA sequence
       number.  Practically, giving the values of the retransmission
       timers used with HIP DATA packets, this means that hosts must
       wait the maximum likely lifetime of the packet before reusing a
       given SEQ_DATA sequence number towards a given destination.
       However, it is not required for node to know the maximum packet
       lifetime.  Rather, it is assumed that the requirement can be met
       by maintaining the value as a simple, 32-bit, "wrap-around"
       counter, incremented each time a packet is sent.  It is an
       implementation choice whether to maintain a single counter for
       the node or multiple counters (one for each source HIT,
       destination HIT combination).
   2.  The host creates PAYLOAD_MIC parameter.  MIC is a hash calculated
       over the whole PAYLOAD which the Next Header field of PAYLOAD_MIC
       parameter indicates.  If there is multiple next header types
       which the host wants to protect it SHOULD create separate
       PAYLOAD_MIC parameter for each of these.  The receiver MUST
       validate all these MICs as described in Section 5.3.1.  For
       calculating MIC the host MUST use the same hash algorithm as the
       one that has been used for generating the host's HIT as defined
       in Section 3.2. of [RFC5201].

Internet-Draft                   HICCUPS                       July 2010


   3.  The host creates HIP_SIGNATURE parameter.  The signature is
       calculated over the whole HIP envelope, excluding any parameters
       after the HIP_SIGNATURE, as defined in Section 5.2.11. of
       [RFC5201].  The receiver MUST validate this signature.  It MAY
       use either the HI in the packet or the HI acquired by some other
       means.
   4.  The hosts sends the created HIP DATA packet and starts a DATA
       timer.  The default value for the timer is 3 seconds.  If
       multiple HIP DATA packets are outstanding, multiple timers are in
       effect.
   5.  If the DATA timer expires, the HIP DATA packet is resent.  The
       HIP DATA packet can be resent DATA_RETRY_MAX times.  The DATA
       timer MUST be exponentially backed off for subsequent
       retransmissions.  If no acknowledgment is received from the peer
       after DATA_RETRY_MAX times, the delivery of the HIP DATA packet
       is considered unsuccessful and the application is notified about
       the error.  The DATA timer is canceled upon receiving an ACK from
       the peer that acknowledges receipt of the HIP DATA packet.  The
       default value for DATA_RETRY_MAX SHOULD be 5 retries, but it MAY
       be changed through local policy.

5.3.  Reception of a HIP DATA packet

   A host receiving a HIP DATA packet makes a decision whether to
   process the packet or not.  If the host, following its local policy,
   suspects that this packet could be part of a DoS attack.  The host
   MAY respond with an R1 packet to the HIP DATA packet, if the packet
   contained SEQ_DATA and PAYLOAD_MIC parameter, in order to indicate
   that HIP base exchange MUST be completed before accepting payload
   packets from the originator of the HIP DATA packet.  If the host
   chooses to respond to the HIP DATA with an R1 packet, it creates a
   new R1 or selects a precomputed R1 according to the format described
   in [RFC5201] Section 5.3.2.  The host SHOULD drop the received data
   packet if it responded with a R1 packet to the HIP_DATA packet.  The
   sender of HIP_DATA packet is responsible for retransmission of the
   upper-layer protocol data after successful completion of the HIP Base
   Exchange.

   If the host, following its local policy, decides to process the
   incoming HIP DATA packet, it processes it according to the following
   rules:

   1.  If the HIP DATA packet contains a SEQ_DATA parameter and no
       ACK_DATA parameter, the HIP DATA packet is processed and replied
       to as described in Section 5.3.1.
   2.  If the HIP DATA packet contains an ACK_DATA parameter and no
       SEQ_DATA parameter, the HIP DATA packet is processed as described
       in Section 5.3.2.

Internet-Draft                   HICCUPS                       July 2010


   3.  If the HIP DATA packet contains both a SEQ_DATA parameter and an
       ACK_DATA parameter, the HIP DATA packet is processed first as
       described in Section 5.3.2 and then the rest of the HIP DATA
       packet is processed and replied to as described in Section 5.3.1.

5.3.1.  Handling of SEQ_DATA in a Received HIP DATA packet

   The following steps define the conceptual processing rules for
   handling a SEQ_DATA parameter in a received HIP DATA packet.

   The system MUST verify the SIGNATURE in the HIP DATA packet.  If the
   verification fail, the packet SHOULD be dropped and an error message
   logged.

   If the value in the received SEQ_DATA and MIC value received
   PAYLOAD_MIC corresponds to a HIP DATA packet that has recently been
   processed, the packet is treated as a retransmission.  It is
   recommended that a host cache HIP DATA packets with ACKs to avoid the
   cost of generating a new ACK packet to respond to a retransmitted HIP
   DATA packet.  The host MUST acknowledge, again, such (apparent) HIP
   DATA packet retransmissions but SHOULD also consider rate-limiting
   such retransmission responses to guard against replay attacks.

   The system MUST verify the PAYLOAD_MIC by calculating MIC over the
   PAYLOAD which the Next Header field indicates.  For calculating the
   MIC the host will use the same hash algorithm that has been used to
   generate the sender's HIT as defined in Section 3.2. of [RFC5201].
   If the packet carried multiple PAYLOAD_MIC parameters each of them
   are verified as described above.  If one or more of the verification
   fails, the packet SHOULD be dropped and an error message logged.

   If a new SEQ parameter is being processed, the parameters in the HIP
   DATA packet are then processed.

   A HIP DATA packet with an ACK_DATA parameter is prepared and sent to
   the peer.  This ACK_DATA parameter may be included in a separate HIP
   DATA packet or piggybacked in a HIP DATA packet with a SEQ_DATA
   parameter.  The ACK_DATA parameter MAY acknowledge more than one of
   the peer's HIP DATA packets.

5.3.2.  Handling of ACK_DATA in a Received HIP DATA packet

   The following steps define the conceptual processing rules for
   handling an ACK_DATA parameter in a received HIP DATA packet.

   The system MUST verify the SIGNATURE in the HIP DATA packet.  If the
   verification fails, the packet SHOULD be dropped and an error message
   logged.

   The sequence numbers reported in the ACK_DATA must match with an
   previously sent HIP DATA packet containing SEQ_DATA that has not
   already been acknowledged.  If no match is found or if the ACK_DATA
   does not acknowledge a new HIP DATA packets, the packet MUST either
   be dropped if no SEQ_DATA parameter is present, or the processing
   steps in Section 5.3.1 are followed.

   The corresponding DATA timer is stopped so that the now acknowledged
   HIP DATA packet is no longer retransmitted.  If multiple HIP DATA
   packets are newly acknowledged, multiple timers are stopped.


6.  Use of the HIP DATA Packet

   HIP currently requires that the four-message base exchange is
   executed at the first encounter of hosts that have not communicated
   before.  This may add additional RTTs (Round Trip Time) to protocols
   based on a single message exchange.  However, the four-message
   exchange is essential to preserve the DoS protection nature of the
   base exchange.  The use of the HIP DATA packet defined in this
   document reduces the initial overhead in the communications between
   two hosts.  However, the HIP DATA packet itself does not provide any
   protection against DoS attacks.  Therefore, the HIP DATA packet MUST
   only be used in environment whose policies provide protection against
   DoS attacks.  For example, a HIP-based overlay may have policies in
   place to control which nodes can join the overlay.  However,
   authorization who is allowed to join the overlay is beyond the scope
   of this specification.  Any particular node in the overlay may want
   to accept HIP DATA packets from other nodes in the overlay given that
   those other nodes were authorized to join the overlay.  However, the
   same node will not accept HIP DATA packets from random nodes that are
   not part of the overlay.  Additionally, the HIP DATA packet itself
   does not provide confidentiality for its payload.  Therefore, the HIP
   DATA packet MUST NOT be used in environments that do not provide an
   appropriate level of confidentiality (e.g., a HIP-based overlay MUST
   NOT send HIP DATA packets unless the connections between overlay
   nodes are encrypted).

   The type of data to be sent is also relevant to whether the use of a
   HIP DATA packet is appropriate.  HIP itself does not support
   fragmentation but relies on underlying IP-layer fragmentation.  This
   may lead to reliability problems in the case where a message cannot
   be easily split over multiple HIP messages.  Therefore, applications
   in environments where fragmentation could be an issue SHOULD NOT
   generate too large HIP DATA packets that may lead to fragmentation.
   The implementation SHOULD check the MTU of the link before sending
   the packet and if the packet size is larger than MTU it SHOULD signal
   to the upper-layer protocol if the packet results in to a ICMP error

   message.  Note that there are environments where fragmentation is not
   an issue.  For example, in some HIP-based overlays, nodes can
   exchange HIP DATA packets on top of TCP connections that provide
   transport-level fragmentation and, thus, avoid IP-level
   fragmentation.

   HIP currently requires that all messages excluding I1s but including
   HIP DATA packets are digitally signed.  This adds to the packet size
   and the processing capacity needed to send packets.  However, in
   applications where security is not paramount, it is possible to use
   very short keys, thereby reducing resource consumption.


7.  Security considerations

   HIP is designed to provide secure authentication of hosts.  HIP also
   attempts to limit the exposure of the host to various denial-of-
   service and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.  However, HIP DATA
   packet, which can be sent without running the HIP base exchange
   between hosts has a trade off that it does not provide the denial-of-
   service protection or confidentiality protection that HIP generally
   provides.  Thus, the host should consider always situations where it
   is appropriate to send or receive HIP DATA packet.  If the
   communication consists more than few round-trips of data or the data
   is highly sensitive in nature the host SHOULD run the base exchange
   with the peer host.

   HIP DATA packet is designed to protect hosts from second preimage
   attacks allowing receiving host to be able to detect, if the message
   was tampered during the transport.  This property is also know as
   weak-collision-resistance.  If a host tries to generate a second
   preimage it would need to generate such second image where 8 last
   octets are matching with original message.

   When handling the PAYLOAD_MIC parameter in the receiving host, using
   the 8-last octets to identify the upper layer protocol doesn't give
   any guarantee that the MIC would be correct thus an attacker could
   send packets where the next header and last 8-octets matches to the
   values carried by PAYLOAD_MIC parameter and thus it is always
   mandatory to verify the MIC value by calculating the hash over the
   payload.

      them over encrypted connections initiated with the Host Identity
      Protocol. </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t> Host Identity Protocol (HIP) <xref target="RFC5201"/>
      signaling messages can be exchanged over plain IP using the
      protocol number reserved for this purpose, or over UDP using the
      UDP port reserved for HIP NAT traversal <xref
      target="RFC5770"/>. When two hosts perform a HIP base exchange,
      they set up an encrypted connection between them for data
      traffic, but continue to use plain IP or UDP for HIP signaling
      messages. </t>

      <t> This document defines how the encrypted connection can be
      used also for HIP signaling messages. Two different modes are
      defined: HIP over Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and HIP
      over TCP. The benefit of sending HIP messages over ESP is that
      all signaling traffic (including HIP headers) will be
      encrypted. If HIP messages are sent over TCP (which in turn is
      transported over ESP), TCP can handle also message fragmentation
      where needed. </t>

    <section title="Transport Mode Negotiation">
      <t> This section defines how support for different HIP signaling
      message transport modes is indicated and how the use of
      different modes is negotiated. </t>

      <section title="Mode Negotiation in the HIP Base Exchange"
        anchor="sec:mode-neg">
      
        <t> A HIP host implementing this specification SHOULD indicate
        the modes it supports, and is willing to use, in the base
        exchange. The HIP signaling message transport mode negotiation
        is similar to HIP NAT traversal mode negotiation: first the
        Responder lists the supported modes in a HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE
        parameter (see <xref target="hip-transport-mode-fig"/>) in the
        R1 packet. The modes are listed in priority order; the more
        preferred mode(s) first. If the Initiator supports, and is
        willing to use, any of the modes proposed by the Responder, it
        selects one of the modes by adding a HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE
        parameter containing the selected mode to the I2
        packet. Finally, if the Initiator selected one of the modes
        and the base exchange succeeds, hosts MUST use the selected
        mode for the following HIP signaling messages sent between
        them for the duration of the HIP association or until another
        mode is negotiated. </t>

        <t> If the Initiator cannot, or will not, use any of the modes
        proposed by the Responder, the Initiator SHOULD include an
        empty HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE parameter to the I2 packet to signal
        that it supports this extension but will not use any of the
        proposed modes. Depending on local policy, the Responder MAY
        either abort the base exchange or continue HIP signaling
        without using an encrypted connection, if there was no
        HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE parameter in I2 or the parameter was
        empty. If the Initiator selects a mode that the Responder does
        not support (and hence was not included in R1), the Responder
        MUST abort the base exchange. If the base exchange is aborted
        due to (possibly lack of) HIP_TRANSPORT_PARAMETER, the
        Responder SHOULD send a NO_VALID_HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE
        notification (see <xref target="sec:notify-types"/>) to the
        Initiator.</t>

        <t> The mode DEFAULT indicates that the same transport mode
        (e.g., plain IP or UDP) that was used for the base exchange
        should be used for subsequent HIP signaling messages. In the
        ESP mode the messages are sent as such on the encrypted ESP
        connection and in the ESP-TCP mode TCP is used within the ESP
        tunnel. If a mode that uses a transport layer connection
        within the ESP tunnel (e.g., ESP-TCP) is offered, the Port
        field MUST contain the local port number the host will use for
        the connection. If none of the modes utilize a transport layer
        protocol, the Port field SHOULD be set to zero when the
        parameter is sent and ignored when received. The Port and Mode
        ID fields are encoded as unsigned integers using network byte
        order. </t>

        <t> The HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE parameter resides on the signed
        part of the HIP packets, and hence it is covered by the
        signatures of the R1, I2, and UPDATE packets. </t>

      </section>

      <section title="Mode Negotiation After the HIP Base Exchange" 
        anchor="sec:neg-after-bex"> 

        <t> If a HIP hosts wants to change to a different transport
        mode (or start using a transport mode) some time after the
        base exchange, it sends a HIP UPDATE packet with a
        HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE parameter containing the mode(s) it would
        prefer to use. The host receiving the UPDATE SHOULD respond
        with an UPDATE packet containing the mode that is selected as
        in the negotiation during the base exchange. If the receiving
        host does not support, or is not willing to use, any of the
        listed modes, it SHOULD respond with an UPDATE packet where
        the HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE parameter contains only the currently
        used transport mode (even if that was not included in the
        previous UPDATE packet) and continue using that mode. </t>

        <t> Since the HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE parameter's type is not
        critical (as defined in Section 5.2.1 of <xref
        target="RFC5201"/>), a host not supporting this extension
        would simply reply with an acknowledgement UPDATE packet
        without a HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE parameter. In such a case,
        depending on local policy as in mode negotiation during the
        base exchange, the host that requested the new transport mode
        MAY close the HIP association. If the association is closed,
        the host closing the association SHOULD send a
        NO_VALID_HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE NOTIFY packet to the other host
        before closing the association. </t>

      <section anchor="sec:notify-types" title="Error Notifications">
        <t> During a HIP signaling transport mode negotiation, if a
        HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE parameter does not contain any mode the
        receiving host is willing to use, or a HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE
        parameter does not exist in a HIP packet where the receiving
        host expected to see it, the receiving host MAY send back a
        NOTIFY packet with a NOTIFICATION parameter <xref
        target="RFC5201"/> error type NO_VALID_HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE
        (value [TBD by IANA; 100]). The Notification Data field for
        the error notifications SHOULD contain the HIP header of the
        rejected packet. </t>

    <section title="HIP Messages on Encrypted Connections">

      <t> This specification defines two different transport modes for
      sending HIP packets over encrypted ESP connections. These modes
      require that the ESP transport format <xref target="RFC5202"/>
      is negotiated to be used between the hosts. If the ESP transport
      format is not used, these modes MUST NOT be offered in the
      HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE parameter. If a HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE parameter
      containing an ESP transport mode is received but the ESP
      transport format is not used, a host MUST NOT select such a mode
      but act as specified in <xref target="sec:mode-neg"/> (if
      performing a base exchange) or <xref
      target="sec:neg-after-bex"/> (if performing an UPDATE) when no
      valid mode is offered. </t>

      <t> The ESP mode provides simple protection for all the
      signaling traffic and can be used as a generic replacement for
      the DEFAULT mode in cases where all signaling traffic should be
      encrypted. If the HIP messages may become so large that they
      would need to be fragmented, e.g., because of HIP certificates
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-cert"/> or DATA messages <xref
      target="RFC6078"/>, it is RECOMMENDED to use the ESP-TCP mode
      which can handle message fragmentation at TCP level instead of
      relying on IP level fragmentation. </t>

      <t> When HIP NAT traversal <xref target="RFC5770"/> is used, the
      ESP and HIP packets are sent UDP-encapsulated. The use of
      different NAT traversal modes, and in particular
      UDP-encapsulation, is independent of the transport mode (as
      specified in this document) of HIP packets. However, when HIP
      packets are sent over an ESP connection, no additional
      UDP-encapsulation (i.e., within the ESP connection) for the HIP
      packets is needed and MUST NOT be used since the ESP packets are
      already UDP-encapsulated, if needed for NAT traversal. For
      example, if UDP-encapsulation is used as defined in <xref
      target="RFC5770"/>, and the ESP-TCP transport mode is used as
      defined in this document, the HIP packets are sent over IP, UDP,
      ESP, and TCP (in that order). </t>

      <t> HIP messages that result in changing or generating new
      keying material, i.e., the base exchange and re-keying UPDATE
      messages, MUST NOT be sent over the encrypted connection that is
      created using the keying material that is being changed, nor
      over an encrypted connection using the newly created keying
      material. </t>

      <t> It should be noted that when HIP messages are sent using an
      encrypted connection, on-path network elements (e.g., firewalls
      and HIP-aware NATs) that would normally see the HIP headers and
      contents of the un-encrypted parameters, cannot see any part of
      the messages unless they have access to the encryption keying
      material. The original HIP design made an explicit decision to
      expose some of this information to HIP-aware NATs. If an
      encrypted transport mode is used, only the base exchange, or
      update without encryption, is visible to such NATs. </t>

      <section title="ESP Mode">
        <t> If the ESP mode is selected in the base exchange, both
        hosts MUST listen for incoming HIP signaling messages and send
        outgoing messages on the encrypted connection. The ESP
        header's next header value for HIP messages sent over ESP MUST
        be set to HIP (139). </t>
        </section>
      
      <section title="ESP-TCP Mode">
        <t> If the ESP-TCP mode is selected, the host with the larger
        HIT (calculated as defined in Section 6.5 of <xref
        target="RFC5201"/>) MUST start to listen for an incoming TCP
        connection on the encrypted connection (i.e., to the HIT of
        the host) on the port it used in the Port field of the
        transport mode parameter. The other host MUST create a TCP
        connection to that port and the host MAY use the port it sent
        in the transport mode parameter as the source port for the
        connection. Once the TCP connection is established, both hosts
        MUST listen for incoming HIP signaling messages and send the
        outgoing messages using the TCP connection. The ESP next
        header value for messages sent using the ESP-TCP mode TCP
        connections MUST be set to TCP (6). </t>

        <t> If the hosts are unable to create the TCP connection, the
        host that initiated the mode negotiation MUST restart the
        negotiation with UPDATE message and SHOULD NOT propose the
        ESP-TCP mode. If local policy does not allow using any other
        mode than ESP-TCP, the HIP association SHOULD be closed. The
        UPDATE or CLOSE message MUST be sent using the same transport
        mode that was used for negotiating the use of the ESP-TCP
        mode. </t>

        <t> Since TCP provides reliable transport, the HIP messages
        sent over TCP MUST NOT be retransmitted. Instead, a host
        SHOULD wait to detect that the TCP connection has failed to
        retransmit the packet successfully in a timely manner (such
        detection is platform- and policy-specific) before concluding
        that there is no response. </t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Recovering from Failed Encrypted Connections" 
     anchor="recovery">

      <t> If the encrypted connection fails for some reason, it can no
      longer be used for HIP signaling and the hosts SHOULD
      re-establish the connection using HIP messages that are sent
      outside of the encrypted connection. Hence, while listening for
      incoming HIP messages on the encrypted connection, hosts MUST
      still accept incoming HIP messages using the same transport
      method (e.g., UDP or plain IP) that was used for the base
      exchange. When responding to a HIP message sent outside of the
      encrypted connection, the response MUST be sent using the same
      transport method as the original message used. If encryption was
      previously used, hosts SHOULD send outside of the encrypted
      connection only HIP messages that are used to re-establish the
      encrypted connection. Especially, messages for which the policy
      is to send them only encrypted (e.g., DATA messages using an
      encrypted transport mode) MUST be sent only using the encrypted
      connection. Note that a policy MUST NOT prevent sending
      un-encrypted UPDATE messages used for re-establishing the
      encrypted connection, since that would prevent recovering from
      failed encrypted connections.</t>

      <t> The UPDATE messages used for re-establishing the encrypted
      connection MUST contain a HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE parameter and the
      negotiation proceeds as described in <xref
      target="sec:neg-after-bex"/>. </t>

    </section>


    <section title="Host Mobility and Multihoming" anchor="mobility">

        <t> If a host obtains a new address, a new Security
        Association (SA) pair may be created for (or an existing SA
        pair may be moved to) the new address, as described in <xref
        target="RFC5206"/>. If the ESP or ESP-TCP transport mode is
        used, HIP signaling continues using the (new) SA pair and the
        same transport mode as before. </t>

        <t> With the ESP mode, the first mobility UPDATE message
        SHOULD be sent using the old SA and the following messages,
        including the response to the first UPDATE, SHOULD be sent
        using the new SAs. Retransmissions of the UPDATE messages use
        the same SA as the original message. If the ESP-TCP mode is
        used, the HIP signaling TCP connection is moved to the new SA
        pair like any other TCP connection. However, the mobility
        UPDATE messages SHOULD NOT be sent over the TCP connection,
        but using plain ESP like in the ESP mode, and consequently
        hosts MUST be prepared to receive UPDATE messages over plain
        ESP even if the ESP-TCP mode is used. </t>

        <t> In some cases the host may not be able to send the
        mobility UPDATE messages using the encrypted connection before
        it breaks. This results in a similar situation as if the
        encrypted connection had failed and the hosts need to
        re-negotiate the new addresses using un-encrypted UPDATE
        messages and possibly rendezvous <xref target="RFC5204"/> or
        HIP relay <xref target="RFC5770"/> servers. Also these UPDATE
        messages MUST contain the HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE parameter and
        perform the transport mode negotiation. </t>

        <t> Examples of the signaling flows with mobility and
        multihoming are shown in <xref target="mob-examples"/>. </t>

    <?rfc needLines="6"?> <!-- prevent orphan line -->
    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sec-security">
      <t> By exchanging the HIP messages over ESP connection, all HIP
      signaling data (after the base exchange but excluding keying
      material (re)negotiation and some of the mobility UPDATE
      messages) will be encrypted, but only if NULL encryption is not
      used. Thus, a host requiring confidentiality for the HIP
      signaling messages must check that encryption is negotiated to
      be used on the ESP connection. Moreover, the level of protection
      provided by the ESP transport modes depends on the selected ESP
      transform; see <xref target="RFC5202"/> and <xref
      target="RFC4303"/> for security considerations of the different
      ESP transforms. </t>

      <t> While this extension to HIP allows for negotiation of
      security features, there is no risk of downgrade attacks since
      the mode negotiation happens using signed (R1/I2 or UPDATE)
      packets and only after both hosts have been securely identified
      in the base exchange. If an attacker would attempt to change the
      modes listed in the HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE parameter, that would
      break the signatures and the base exchange (or update) would not
      complete. Furthermore, since both "secure" modes (ESP and
      ESP-TCP) defined in this document are equally secure, only
      possible downgrade attack would be to make both hosts accept the
      DEFAULT mode. If the local policy (of either host) requires
      using a secure mode, the base exchange or update would again
      simply fail (as described in <xref

    <section title="Mobility and Multihoming Examples" anchor="mob-examples">

      <t> When changing interfaces due to mobility or multihoming, the
      hosts use HIP messages to notify the other host about the new
      address and to check that the host with the new address is still
      reachable. The following examples show the signaling performed
      during the address change in two different scenarios. Note that
      not all HIP parameters nor all the content of the parameters is
      shown in the examples. This section and the examples are not
      normative; for normative behavior, see previous sections. </t>

      <t> In the examples, the host A uses two different addresses (a1
      and a2) while the host B has just a single address (b1). In the
      first example, make before break (<xref
      target="make-b4-break"/>), host A starts to use the new address
      but can still use the old address (due to multihoming) for
      signaling. In the second example, break before make (<xref
      target="break-b4-make"/>), host A loses the first address before
      obtaining the second address (e.g., due to mobility) and the
      mobility HIP signaling is done without the encrypted
      connection. </t>

      <t> The following notations are used in the examples:</t>
      <t> <list style="symbols">

          <t> ESPx(y): data y sent encapsulated in ESP with SA x; if
          ESP-encapsulation is not used, the data is sent over plain
          IP or UDP</t>

		 <xref target="RFC1034"> Domain Name System (DNS) </xref>, and
		 how to use it with the <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5201-bis">
			 Host Identity Protocol (HIP)</xref>.  This RR allows a

		The current Internet architecture defines two global
		namespaces: IP addresses and domain names.  The Domain Name
		System provides a two way lookup between these two
		namespaces.  The <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-arch">HIP
			architecture</xref> defines a new third namespace,
		called the Host Identity Namespace.  This namespace is
		composed of Host Identifiers (HI) of HIP nodes.  The Host
		Identity Tag (HIT) is one representation of an HI.  This
		representation is obtained by taking the output of a secure
		hash function applied to the HI, truncated to the IPv6
		address size.  HITs are intended to be used in the place of
		IP addresses within most ULPs and applications.
			
		</t> 
		<t>
			The <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5201-bis">Host Identity
				Protocol </xref> allows two HIP nodes to
			establish a HIP Association.
			A HIP association is bound to
			the nodes HIs rather than to their IP address(es).
		</t>
<t> 
   A HIP node establishes a HIP association by initiating a 4 way handshake
   where two parties, the Initiator and Responder, exchange the I1,
   I2, R1 and R2 HIP packets (see section 5.3 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5201-bis"/>)

		Although a HIP node can initiate HIP communication
		"opportunistically", i.e., without prior knowledge of its
		peer's HI, doing so exposes both endpoints to Man-in-the-Middle  (MitM)
		attacks on the HIP handshake and its cryptographic protocol.
		Hence, there is a desire to gain knowledge of peers' HI before
		applications and ULPs initiate communication.  Because many
		applications use the <xref target="RFC1034">Domain Name System</xref> to
		name nodes, DNS
		is a straightforward way
		to provision nodes with the HIP information (i.e., HI, HIT and
		possibly RVS) of nodes named in the DNS tree, without
		introducing or relying on an additional piece of
		infrastructure.  Note that in the absence of <xref target="RFC2065">DNSSEC</xref>, 
		the DNS name resolution is vulnerable to a Man-in-the-Middle attack (See <xref target="sec-cons"/>),
		and hence the HIP handshake is also vulnerable to a Man-in-the-Middle attack.

			The proposed <xref target="RFC5206">HIP

			dynamically change its set of underlying IP addresses
			while maintaining IPsec SA and transport layer session
			survivability.  The <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5204-bis">HIP
				rendezvous extensions</xref> proposal allows a
			HIP node to maintain HIP reachability while it is
			changing its current location (the node IP
			address(es)).  This rendezvous service is provided by a
			third party, the node's rendezvous server (RVS).

			An Initiator (I) willing to establish a HIP association
			with a Responder (R) would typically initiate a HIP
			exchange by sending an I1 towards the RVS IP address
			rather than towards the Responder IP address.  Then,
			the RVS, noticing that the receiver HIT is not its own,
			but the HIT of a HIP node registered for the rendezvous
			service, would relay the I1 to the Responder.  Typically
			the Responder would then complete the exchange without
			further assistance from the RVS by sending an R1
			directly to the Initiator IP address.

			</t>

	<t>

		Currently, most of the Internet applications that need to
		communicate with a remote host first translate a domain
		name (often obtained via user input) into one or more IP
		address(es).  This step occurs prior to communication with
		the remote host, and relies on a DNS lookup.

		</t>
		<t>

			
			With HIP, IP addresses are intended to be used mostly
			for on-the-wire communication between end hosts, while
			most Upper Layer Protocols (ULP) and applications use
			HIs or HITs instead (ICMP might be an example of an ULP
			not using them).  Consequently, we need a means to
			translate a domain name into an HI.  Using the DNS for
			this translation is pretty straightforward: We define a
			new HIP resource record.  Upon query by an application
			or ULP for a name to IP address lookup, the resolver would
			then additionally perform a name to HI lookup, and
			use it to construct the resulting HI to IP address mapping
			(which is internal to the HIP layer).  The HIP layer
			uses the HI to IP address mapping to translate HIs and HITs
			into IP addresses and vice versa.

		</t>
	<t>
			
			The <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5204-bis">HIP Rendezvous
			Extension</xref> allows a HIP node to be
			reached via the IP address(es) of a third party, the
			node's rendezvous server (RVS).  An Initiator willing
			to establish a HIP association with a Responder served
			by an RVS would typically initiate a HIP exchange by
			sending an I1 towards the RVS IP address rather than
			towards the Responder IP address.  Consequently, we
			need a means to find the name of a rendezvous server
			for a given host name.

    <section title="Usage Scenarios"> 

	    <t>
		
		In this section, we briefly introduce a number of usage
		scenarios where the DNS is useful with the Host Identity
		Protocol.
	
	    </t>
	    <t>

		With HIP, most applications and ULPs are unaware of the IP
		addresses used to carry packets on the wire.  Consequently,
		a HIP node could take advantage of having multiple IP
		addresses for fail-over, redundancy, mobility, or
		renumbering, in a manner that is transparent to most ULPs
		and applications (because they are bound to HIs; hence, they
		are agnostic to these IP address changes).
		
		</t> <t> 
		
		In these situations, for a node to be reachable by
		reference to its Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), the following
		information should be stored in the DNS:

      </t>

      <t>
      <list style="symbols">
	      
	      <t>A set of IP address(es) via A <xref target="RFC1035"/>
		and AAAA <xref target="RFC3596"/> RR sets (RRSets <xref target="RFC2181"/>).</t> 
	      
	      <t>A Host Identity (HI), Host Identity Tag (HIT), and possibly a set of rendezvous servers (RVS) through HIP RRs.</t>
	      

    </list>
    </t>
	The HIP RR is class independent.
	    <t>
    </t>
	    <t>

		When a HIP node wants to initiate communication with another
		HIP node, it first needs to perform a HIP base exchange to set
		up a HIP association towards its peer.  Although such an
		exchange can be initiated opportunistically, i.e., without
		prior knowledge of the Responder's HI, by doing so both nodes
		knowingly risk man-in-the-middle attacks on the HIP exchange.
		To prevent these attacks, it is recommended that the Initiator
		first obtain the HI of the Responder, and then initiate the
		exchange.  This can be done, for example, through manual
		configuration or DNS lookups.  Hence, a new HIP RR is
		introduced.
		
	    </t>
	    <t>

		   When a HIP node is frequently changing its IP address(es),
		   the natural DNS latency for propagating changes may prevent
		   it from publishing its new IP address(es) in the DNS.  For
		   solving this problem, the <xref target="RFC4423"> HIP
		   Architecture</xref> introduces rendezvous servers (RVSs) <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5204-bis"/>.  
		   A HIP host uses a rendezvous server as a rendezvous point to
		   maintain reachability with possible HIP initiators while
		   moving <xref target="RFC5206"/>.  Such a HIP node
		   would publish in the DNS its RVS domain name(s) in a HIP RR,
		   while keeping its RVS up-to-date with its current set of IP
		   addresses. 
		
	    </t>
	    <t>
		
		When a HIP node wants to initiate a HIP exchange with a
		Responder, it will perform a number of DNS lookups. Depending
		on the type of implementation, the order in which those lookups
		will be issued may vary. For instance, implementations using
		HIT in APIs may typically first query for HIP 
		resource records at the Responder FQDN, while those using an
		IP address in APIs may typically first query for A and/or AAAA
		resource records.

		</t>
		<t>
		
		In the following, we assume that the Initiator first queries 
                for HIP resource records at the Responder FQDN.


		</t>
		<t>
    
		If the query for the HIP type was responded to with a DNS
		answer with RCODE=3 (Name Error), then the Responder's information
		is not present in the DNS and further queries for the same owner name
		SHOULD NOT be made.
		</t>
		<t>

		In case the query for the HIP records returned a DNS answer
		with RCODE=0 (No Error) and an empty answer section, it means
		that no HIP information is available at the responder name. In
		such a case, if the Initiator has been configured with a policy
		to fallback to opportunistic HIP (initiating without knowing
		the Responder's HI) or plain IP, it would send out more
		queries for A and AAAA types at the Responder's FQDN.
		
		</t>
		<t>
 
		Depending on the combinations of answers, the situations described in 
		<xref target="single"/> and <xref target="mobile"/> <!--and <xref target="mixed"/>
		--> can occur. 

		</t>
		<t>

		Note that storing HIP RR information in the DNS at an FQDN
		that is assigned to a non-HIP node might have ill
		effects on its reachability by HIP nodes.

      title="Overview of Using the DNS with HIP">

   <section title="Storing HI, HIT, and RVS in the DNS">

<t>
	
For any HIP node, its Host Identity (HI), the associated Host Identity
Tag (HIT), and the FQDN of its possible RVSs can be stored in a DNS HIP RR.
Any conforming implementation may store a Host Identity (HI) and its associated
Host Identity Tag (HIT) in a DNS HIP RDATA format. <!-- If a particular form of
an HI does not already have a specified RDATA format, a new RDATA-like format
SHOULD be defined for the HI.--> HI and HIT are defined in Section 3 of the <xref
target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5201-bis">HIP specification</xref>.
 

</t>
<!--      <section title="Different types of HITs">
	      <t>
		

   There are two types of HITs.  HITs of the first type, called Type 1
   HIT, consist of an 8-bit prefix followed by 120 bits of the hash of
   the public key.  HITs of the second type (Type 2 HIT) consist of a
   Host Assigning Authority Field (HAA), and only the last 64 bits come
   from a SHA-1 hash of the Host Identity.  This latter format for HIT
   is recommended for 'well known' systems.  It is possible to support a
   resolution mechanism for these names in hierarchical directories,
   like the DNS. 
</t><t>
   This document fully specifies only Type 2 HITs. Type 1 HITs 
are specified in Section 3.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5201-bis"/>.
		</t><t>


		Note that the format how HITs are stored in the HIP RRs may be
		   different form the format actually used in protocols,
		   the HIP base exchange <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5201-bis"/> included.  This is because
		   the DNS RR explicitly contains the HIT type and algorithm,
			   while some protocols may prefer to use a prefix
			   to indicate the HIT type.  The implementations
			   are expected to use the actual HI when comparing
			   Host Identities.  </t>

   <section title="Host Assigning Authority (HAA) field">

	<t>
		 
		The 64 bits of HAA supports two levels of delegation.  The
		first is a registered assigning authority (RAA).  The second is
		a registered identity (RI, commonly a company).  The RAA is 24
		bits with values assign sequentially by ICANN.  The RI is 40
		bits, also assigned sequentially but by the RAA.</t>

	  </section>

   <section title="Storing HAA in HIP Resource Records">

    <t>

Any conforming implementation may store a domain name Host Assigning Authority
(HAA) in a DNS HIP RDATA format.  A HAA MUST be stored like a Type 2 HIT, 
while the least significant bits of the HIT
extracted from the HI hash output are set to zero, the Host Identity Length is
set zero, and the Host Identity field is omitted.  If a particular form of a HAA
does not already have an associated HIT specified RDATA format, a new
RDATA-like format SHOULD be defined for the HIT/HAA. 
 
</t>

      </section>

-->

	      <t>
	
	Upon return of a HIP RR, a host MUST always calculate the
	HI-derivative HIT to be used in the HIP exchange, as specified in Section 3 
        of the
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5201-bis">HIP specification</xref>, while
	the HIT possibly embedded along SHOULD only be used as an
	optimization (e.g., table lookup). 

      </t>
	      
		<t> 
			
			The HIP resource record may also contain
			one or more domain name(s) of rendezvous
			server(s) towards which HIP I1 packets might be sent to
			trigger the establishment of an association with the
			entity named by this resource record <xref
				target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5204-bis"/>.

	   </t> 
<t>
The rendezvous server field of the HIP resource record stored at a 
given owner name MAY include the owner name itself. A semantically 
equivalent situation occurs if no rendezvous server is present in the 
HIP resource record stored at that owner name.

Such situations occur in two cases:
<list style="symbols">
<t>The host is mobile, and the A and/or AAAA resource record(s) stored 
at its host name contain the IP address(es) of its rendezvous 
server rather than its own one.</t>
<t>The host is stationary, and can be reached directly at the IP 
address(es) contained in the A and/or AAAA resource record(s) stored at 
its host name. This is a degenerated case of rendezvous service where 
the host somewhat acts as a rendezvous server for itself.</t> 
</list>
</t>

	   <t> 

	An RVS receiving such an I1 would then relay it to the appropriate
	Responder (the owner of the I1 receiver HIT).  The Responder will then
	complete the exchange with the Initiator, typically without ongoing help
	from the RVS.
	
	</t> 
	</section>



      <section title="Initiating Connections Based on DNS Names">

	      <t> 
		      
		      On a HIP node, a Host Identity Protocol exchange SHOULD
		      be initiated whenever a ULP attempts to
		      communicate with an entity and the DNS lookup returns
		      HIP resource records. 

  </t>

      </section>
    </section>




<section anchor="rdata" title="HIP RR Storage Format">
		<t>

			The RDATA for a HIP RR consists of a public key
			algorithm type, the HIT length, a HIT, a public key, and
			optionally one or more rendezvous server(s).

    <section title="Retrieving Multiple HITs and IPs from the DNS">
	    <t>

       If a host receives multiple HITs in a response to a DNS query, those
       HITs MUST be considered to denote a single service, and be semantically
       equivalent from that point of view.  When initiating a base exchange
       with the denoted service, the host SHOULD be prepared to accept any of
       HITs as the peer's identity.  A host MAY implement this by using the
       opportunistic mode (destination HIT null in I1), or by sending multiple
       I1s, if needed.

       </t><t>
			       
	  In particular, if a host receives multiple HITs and multiple IP
	  addresses in response to a DNS query, the host cannot know how the
	  HITs are reachable at the listed IP addresses.  The mapping may be
	  any, i.e., all HITs may be reachable at all of the listed IP
	  addresses, some of the HITs may be reachable at some of the IP
	  addresses, or there may even be one-to-one mapping between the HITs
	  and IP addresses.  In general, the host cannot know the mapping and
	  MUST NOT expect any particular mapping.
							     
       </t><t>
			       
	It is RECOMMENDED that if a host receives multiple HITs, the host
	SHOULD first try to initiate the base exchange by using the
	opportunistic mode.  If the returned HIT does not match with any of the
	expected HITs, the host SHOULD retry by sending further I1s, one at
	time, trying out all of the listed HITs.  If the host receives an R1
	for any of the I1s, the host SHOULD continue to use the successful IP
	address until an R1 with a listed HIT is received, or the host has
	tried all HITs, and try the other IP addresses only after that.  A host
	MAY also send multiple I1s in parallel, but sending such I1s MUST be
	rate-limited to avoid flooding (as per Section 8.4.1 of <xref
		target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5201-bis"/>).  </t>

	 During a transition period, to allows to store the HIP informations of
	 a node in a DNS server which does not support the HIP and HIPRVS
	 RRs, A and AAAA RRs MAY be overloaded.  A HIT would typically be stored
	 in a AAAA RR and an RVS in either a A or AAAA RR.  If such a situation
	 occurs, the overloaded RRs MUST be returned as the last items of the
	 returned RRs set (A or AAAA), to avoid as most as possible conflicts

	    <t>

		    This section contains a description of the
		    known threats involved with the usage of the HIP DNS
		    Extension.  
		    
		    </t> <t>	    
		    
		    
		    In a manner similar to the <xref
			    target="RFC4025"> IPSECKEY RR</xref>,
		    the HIP DNS Extension allows for the provision of two HIP nodes
		    with the public keying material (HI) of their peer.  These
		    HIs will be subsequently used in a key exchange between the
		    peers.  Hence, the HIP DNS Extension introduces the same
		    kind of threats that IPSECKEY does, plus threats caused by
		    the possibility given to a HIP node to initiate or accept a
		    HIP exchange using "opportunistic" or "unpublished
		    Initiator HI" modes.
	
	    </t>

	    <t>

		    A HIP node SHOULD obtain HIP RRs
		    from a trusted party trough a secure channel ensuring
		    data integrity and authenticity of the RRs. DNSSEC 
		<xref target="RFC4033"/>
		<xref target="RFC4034"/>
		<xref target="RFC4035"/>
			    provides such a secure channel. However, it should
			    be emphasized that DNSSEC only offers data integrity
			    and authenticity guarantees to the channel between the DNS server publishing
			    a zone and the HIP node. DNSSEC does not ensure that the entity 
			    publishing the zone is trusted. Therefore, the RRSIG signature of
			    the HIP RRSet MUST NOT be misinterpreted as a certificate binding the
			    HI and/or the HIT to the owner name.
			    

	    </t>
	    <t>

		    In the absence of a proper secure channel, both
		    parties are vulnerable to MitM and DoS attacks, and
		    unrelated parties might be subject to DoS attacks
		    as well.  These threats are described in the following
		    sections.
		    
		</t>

		<section title="Attacker Tampering with an Insecure HIP RR">


		<t>

		    The HIP RR contains public keying material in the
		    form of the named peer's public key (the HI) and its
		    secure hash (the HIT).  Both of these are not sensitive
		    to attacks where an adversary gains knowledge of them.
		    However, an attacker that is able to mount an active
		    attack on the DNS, i.e., tampers with this HIP RR
		    (e.g., using DNS spoofing), is able to mount
		    Man-in-the-Middle attacks on the cryptographic core of
		    the eventual HIP exchange (Responder's HIP RR
		    rewritten by the attacker).

	    </t>
	    <t> 

		    The HIP RR may contain a rendezvous server domain name resolved into a destination IP address where the
		    named peer is reachable by an I1, as per the
		    <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5204-bis">HIP Rendezvous
		    Extension</xref>.
		    Thus, an attacker able to tamper with this RR
		    is able to redirect I1 packets sent
		    to the named peer to a chosen IP address for
		    DoS or MitM attacks.  Note that this kind of attack
		    is not specific to HIP and exists independently of 
		    whether or not HIP and the HIP RR are used.  Such an
		    attacker might tamper with A and AAAA RRs as well.

	    </t>
		    <t>
			
		    An attacker might obviously use these two
		    attacks in conjunction: It will replace the
		    Responder's HI and RVS IP address by its own
		    in a spoofed DNS packet sent to the Initiator HI,
		    then redirect all exchanged packets to him
		    and mount a MitM on HIP.  In this case, HIP won't
		    provide confidentiality nor Initiator HI protection
		    from eavesdroppers.
			    
			    </t> 
		    </section>	
<!--	    <section title="Opportunistic HIP">

		    <t>
			    
		    A HIP Initiator may not be aware of its peer's HI, and/or
		    its HIT (e.g., because the DNS does not contains HIP
		    material, or the resolver isn't HIP-enabled), and attempt
		    an opportunistic HIP exchange towards its known IP
		    address, filling the Responder HIT field with zeros in
		    the I1 header.  Such an Initiator is vulnerable to a MitM
		    attack because it can't validate the HI and HIT contained
		    in a replied R1.  Hence, an implementation MAY choose not
		    to use opportunistic mode.

	    </t>
	    </section>	
	    <section title="Unpublished Initiator HI">

  <t>

	  A HIP Initiator may choose to use an unpublished HI,
			which is not stored in the DNS by means of a HIP
			RR.  A Responder associating with such an Initiator
			knowingly risks a MitM attack because it cannot
			validate the Initiator's HI.  Hence, an implementation
			MAY choose not to use unpublished mode.
		
		</t>
    </section>	
-->		    

    <section title="Hash and HITs Collisions">
		    
		    <t>

			    As with many cryptographic algorithms, some secure
			    hashes (e.g., SHA1, used by HIP to generate a HIT
			    from an HI) eventually become insecure, because an
			    exploit has been found in which an attacker with
			    reasonable computation power breaks one of the
			    security features of the hash (e.g., its supposed
			    collision resistance).  This is why a HIP end-node
			    implementation SHOULD NOT authenticate its HIP
			    peers based solely on a HIT retrieved from the DNS,
			    but SHOULD rather use HI-based authentication.

In the absence of DNSSEC, the HIP RR is subject to the
threats described in <xref target="RFC3833">RFC 3833</xref>.

    <section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="iana-cons">

  <t>

	IANA has allocated one new RR type code (55) for the HIP RR
	from the standard RR type space.

  </t>
  <t>

	IANA does not need to open a new registry for 
	public key algorithms of the HIP RR because the HIP RR reuses "algorithms
	types" defined for the <xref target="RFC4025">IPSECKEY RR
	</xref>.
Presently defined values are shown here for reference only:

	   <t>
		   
   In the future, if a new algorithm is to be used
      for the HIP RR, a new algorithm type and
         corresponding public key encoding should be defined
	    for the IPSECKEY RR. The HIP RR should reuse both
	       the same algorithm type and the same corresponding
	          public key format as the IPSECKEY RR.

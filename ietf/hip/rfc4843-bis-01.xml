  <abstract>

  <t> This document introduces Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers
  (ORCHID) as a new, experimental class of IPv6-address-like
  identifiers. These identifiers are intended to be used as endpoint
  identifiers at applications and Application Programming Interfaces (API)
  and not as identifiers for
  network location at the IP layer, i.e., locators. They are designed to
  appear as application layer entities and at the existing IPv6 APIs,
  but they should not appear in actual IPv6 headers. To make them more
  like vanilla IPv6 addresses, they are expected to be routable at an
  overlay level. Consequently, while they are considered non-routable
  addresses from the IPv6 layer point-of-view, all existing IPv6
  applications are expected to be able to use them in a manner
  compatible with current IPv6 addresses. </t>

  <t>
    This document requests IANA to allocate a temporary prefix out of
    the IPv6 addressing space for Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash
    Identifiers. By default, the prefix will be returned to IANA in
    2014, with continued use requiring IETF consensus.

  <section title="Introduction">

    <t> This document introduces Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers
    (ORCHID), a new class of IP address-like identifiers. These
    identifiers are intended to be globally unique in a statistical
    sense (see <xref target="sec-API-issues" />), non-routable at the IP
    layer, and routable at some overlay layer. The identifiers are
    securely bound, via a secure hash function, to the concatenation of
    an input bitstring and a context tag. Typically, but not
    necessarily, the input bitstring will include a suitably encoded
    public cryptographic key. </t>

    <section title="Rationale and Intent">

    <t> These identifiers are expected to be used at the existing IPv6
    Application Programming Interfaces (API) and application protocols between consenting hosts. They may be
    defined and used in different contexts, suitable for different
    overlay protocols. Examples of these include Host Identity Tags
    (HIT) in the <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5201-bis"> Host Identity Protocol 
    (HIP) </xref> and <xref target="PRIVACYTEXT">
    Temporary Mobile Identifiers (TMI) for Mobile IPv6 Privacy Extension
    </xref>. </t>

    <t> As these identifiers are expected to be used along with IPv6
    addresses at both applications and APIs, co-ordination is desired
    to make sure that an ORCHID is not inappropriately taken for a
    vanilla IPv6 address and vice versa. In practice, allocation of a
    separate prefix for ORCHIDs seems to suffice, making them compatible
    with IPv6 addresses at the upper layers while simultaneously making
    it trivial to prevent their usage at the IP layer. </t>

    <t> While being technically possible to use ORCHIDs between
    consenting hosts without any co-ordination with the IETF and the
    IANA, the authors would consider such practice 
    potentially dangerous. A specific danger would be realised if the
    IETF community later decided to use the ORCHID prefix for some
    different purpose. In that case, hosts using the ORCHID prefix would
    be, for practical purposes, unable to use the prefix for the other
    new purpose. That would lead to partial balkanisation of the
    Internet, similar to what has happened as a result of historical
    hijackings of non-<xref target="RFC1918"> RFC 1918 </xref> IPv4
    addresses for private use.</t> 
<!-- RFC Editor Comment: we inserted an informative reference to RFC
1918 because of the text above.  Please verify that it is correctly
listed as an informative instead, i.e., not normative.  -->

    <t> The whole need for the proposed allocation grows from the desire
    to be able to use ORCHIDs with existing applications and APIs. This
    desire leads to the potential conflict, mentioned above. Resolving
    the conflict requires the proposed allocation.</t>

    <t> One can argue that the desire to use these kinds of identifiers
    via existing APIs is architecturally wrong, and there is some truth
    in that argument. Indeed, it would be more desirable to introduce a
    new API and update all applications to use identifiers, rather than
    locators, via that new API. That is exactly what we expect to happen
    in the long run.</t>

    <t> However, given the current state of the Internet, we do not
    consider it viable to introduce any changes that, at once, require
    applications to be rewritten and host stacks to be updated. Rather
    than that, we believe in piece-wise architectural changes that
    require only one of the existing assets to be touched. ORCHIDs are
    designed to address this situation: to allow people to experiment
    with protocol stack extensions, such as secure overlay routing, HIP,
    or Mobile IP privacy extensions, without requiring them to update
    their applications. The goal is to facilitate large-scale
    experiments with minimum user effort.</t>

    <t> For example, there already exists, at the time of this writing,
    HIP implementations that run fully in user space, using the
    operating system to divert a certain part of the IPv6 address space
    to a user level daemon for HIP processing. In practical terms, these
    implementations are already using a certain IPv6 prefix for
    differentiating HIP identifiers from IPv6 addresses, allowing them
    both to be used by the existing applications via the existing
    APIs.</t>
    
     <t>This document argues for allocating an experimental
    prefix for such purposes, thereby paving the way for large-scale
    experiments with cryptographic identifiers without the dangers
    caused by address-space hijacking. </t>

    <section title="ORCHID Properties">

    <t>ORCHIDs are designed to have the following properties:
<t></t>
      <list style="symbols">

        <t> Statistical uniqueness; also see <xref
        target="sec-API-issues" /> </t>

        <t> Secure binding to the input parameters used in their
        generation (i.e., the context identifier and a bitstring). </t>

        <t> Aggregation under a single IPv6 prefix. Note that this is
        only needed due to the co-ordination need as indicated above.
        Without such co-ordination need, the ORCHID namespace could
        potentially be completely flat. </t>

        <t> Non-routability at the IP layer, by design. </t>

        <t> Routability at some overlay layer, making them, from an
        application point of view, semantically similar to IPv6
        addresses. </t> </list> </t>

    <t> As mentioned above, ORCHIDs are intended to be generated and
    used in different contexts, as suitable for different mechanisms and
    protocols. The context identifier is meant to be used to
    differentiate between the different contexts; see <xref
    target="sec-API-issues" /> for a discussion of the related API and
    kernel level implementation issues, and <xref target="sec-design" />
    for the design choices explaining why the context identifiers are
    used. </t>

      Examples of identifiers and protocols that are expected to adopt

  <section title="Cryptographic Hash Identifier Construction">

    <t>
      An ORCHID is generated using the algorithm below.  The algorithm takes a bitstring and a context identifier as input and produces an ORCHID as output.
    </t>

    <figure>
      <artwork><![CDATA[
Input      :=  any bitstring
Hash Input :=  Context ID | Input
Hash       :=  Hash_function( Hash Input )
ORCHID     :=  Prefix | Encode_100( Hash )

where:

|          	: Denotes concatenation of bitstrings

Input           : A bitstring that is unique or statistically unique
                  within a given context. The bitstring is intended 
                  to be associated with the to-be-created ORCHID in 
                  the given context.

Context ID      : A randomly generated value defining the expected
             	  usage context for the particular ORCHID and the 
		  hash function to be used for generation of ORCHIDs
		  in this context.  These values are allocated out of
		  the namespace introduced for CGA Type Tags; see RFC
		  3972 and 
                  http://www.iana.org/assignments/cga-message-types.

Hash_function	: The one-way hash function (i.e., hash function with 
                  pre-image resistance and second pre-image 
                  resistance) to be used according to the document
                  defining the context usage identified by the
                  Context ID.  For example, the current version of
                  the HIP specification defines SHA1 [RFC3174] as 
                  the hash function to be used to generate ORCHIDs 
                  used in the HIP protocol [I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5201-bis].

Encode_100( )   : An extraction function in which output is obtained
                  by extracting the middle 100-bit-long bitstring
                  from the argument bitstring. 

Prefix          : A constant 28-bit-long bitstring value 
                  (2001:10::/28).

      ]]></artwork>
    </figure>

    <t>To form an ORCHID, two pieces of input data are needed. The first
    piece can be any bitstring, but is typically expected to contain a
    public cryptographic key and some other data. The second piece is a
    context identifier, which is a 128-bit-long datum, allocated as
    specified in <xref target="sec-IANA" />. Each specific experiment
    (such as HIP HITs or MIP6 TMIs) is expected to allocate their own,
    specific context identifier.</t>

    <t>The input bitstring and context identifier are concatenated to
    form an input datum, which is then fed to the cryptographic hash
    function to be used according to the document defining the
                      context usage identified by the Context ID.
	The result of the hash function is processed by an
    encoding function, resulting in a 100-bit-long value. This value is
    prepended with the 28-bit ORCHID prefix. The result is the ORCHID, a
    128-bit-long bitstring that can be used at the IPv6 APIs in hosts
    participating to the particular experiment.</t>

        <t>The ORCHID prefix is allocated under the IPv6 global unicast address 
	block. Hence, ORCHIDs are indistinguishable from IPv6 global unicast addresses.
	However, it should be noted that ORCHIDs do not conform with the IPv6 global
	unicast address format defined in Section 2.5.4 of <xref target="RFC4291"/> since
	they do not have a 64-bit Interface ID formatted as
	   described in Section 2.5.1. of <xref target="RFC4291"/>. </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Routing Considerations">

    <t> ORCHIDs are designed to serve as location independent
    endpoint-identifiers rather than IP-layer locators. Therefore,
    routers MAY be configured not to forward any packets containing an
    ORCHID as a source or a destination address. If the destination
    address is an ORCHID but the source address is a valid unicast source
    address, routers MAY be configured to generate an ICMP Destination
    Unreachable, Administratively Prohibited message. </t>

    <t> Due to the experimental nature of ORCHIDs, router software MUST
    NOT include any special handling code for ORCHIDs. In other words,
    the non-routability property of ORCHIDs, if implemented, MUST be
    implemented via configuration and NOT by hardwired software code.
    At this time, it is RECOMMENDED that the default router
    configuration not handle ORCHIDs in any special way. In other
    words, there is no need to touch existing or new routers due to this
    experiment. If such a reason should later appear, for example, due to
    a faulty implementation leaking ORCHIDs to the IP layer, the prefix
    can be and should be blocked by a simple configuration rule. </t>

    <section title="Overlay Routing"> 

      <t> As mentioned multiple times, ORCHIDs are designed to be
      non-routable at the IP layer. However, there are multiple ongoing
      research efforts for creating various overlay routing and
      resolution mechanisms for flat identifiers. For example, <xref
      target="Hi3">the Host Identity Indirection Infrastructure
      (Hi3)</xref> and <xref
      target="NodeID">Node
Identity Internetworking Architecture (NodeID)</xref> proposals, outline ways for using a Distributed Hash
      Table to forward HIP packets based on the Host Identity Tag.</t>

      <t> What is common to the various research proposals is that they
      create a new kind of resolution or routing infrastructure on
      top of the existing Internet routing structure. In practical
      terms, they allow delivery of packets based on flat, non-routable
      identifiers, utilising information stored in a distributed
      database. Usually, the database used is based on Distributed Hash 
      Tables. This effectively creates a new routing network on top
      of the existing IP-based routing network, capable of routing
      packets that are not addressed by IP addresses but some other kind
      of identifiers.</t>

      <t> Typical benefits from overlay routing include location
      independence, more scalable multicast, anycast, and multihoming
      support than in IP, and better DoS resistance than in the vanilla
      Internet. The main drawback is typically an order of magnitude of
      slower performance, caused by an easily largish number of extra
      look-up or forwarding steps needed.  Consequently, in most
      practical cases, the overlay routing system is used only during
      initial protocol state set-up (cf. TCP handshake), after which the
      communicating endpoints exchange packets directly with IP,
      bypassing the overlay network.</t>

      <t> The net result of the typical overlay routing approaches is a
      communication service whose basic functionality is comparable to
      that provided by classical IP but provides considerably
      better resilience that vanilla IP in dynamic networking
      environments. Some experiments also introduce additional
      functionality, such as enhanced security or ability to effectively
      route through several IP addressing domains.</t>

      <t> The authors expect ORCHIDs to become fully routable, via one
      or more overlay systems, before the end of the experiment. </t>

  </section>

  <section anchor="sec-API-issues" title="Collision Considerations">
  <!--<section anchor="sec-API-issues" title="API, ULP and Related
      Considerations">-->

    <t> As noted above, the aim is that ORCHIDs are globally unique in a
    statistical sense. That is, given the ORCHID referring to a given
    entity, the probability of the same ORCHID being used to refer to
    another entity elsewhere in the Internet must be sufficiently low so
    that it can be ignored for most practical purposes. We believe that
    the presented design meets this goal; see <xref target="sec-design"
    />.</t>

    <t>Consider next the very rare case that some ORCHID happens to
    refer to two different entities at the same time, at two different
    locations in the Internet. Even in this case, the probability of this
    fact becoming visible (and therefore a matter of consideration) at
    any single location in the Internet is negligible. For the vast
    majority of cases, the two simultaneous uses of the ORCHID will never
    cross each other. However, while rare, such collisions are still
    possible. This section gives reasonable guidelines on how to
    mitigate the consequences in the case that such a collision happens. </t>

    <t> As mentioned above, ORCHIDs are expected to be used at the
    legacy IPv6 APIs between consenting hosts. The context ID is
    intended to differentiate between the various experiments, or
    contexts, sharing the ORCHID namespace. However, the context ID is
    not present in the ORCHID itself, but only in front of the input
    bitstring as an input to the hash function. While this may lead to
    certain implementation-related complications, we believe that the
    trade-off of allowing the hash result part of an ORCHID being longer
    more than pays off the cost. </t>

    <t> Because ORCHIDs are not routable at the IP layer, in order
    to send packets using ORCHIDs at the API level, the sending host
    must have additional overlay state within the stack to
    determine which parameters (e.g., what locators) to use in the outgoing
    packet. An underlying assumption here, and a matter of fact in the
    proposals that the authors are aware of, is that there is an overlay
    protocol for setting up and maintaining this additional state. It is
    assumed that the state-set-up protocol carries the input bitstring,
    and that the resulting ORCHID-related state in the stack can be
    associated back with the appropriate context and state-set-up
    protocol. </t>

<!--
    <t>
      In some cases hosts may receive ORCHIDs without having an
      appropriate additional state in the stack.  In such cases the
      API or ULP operations SHOULD fail, with an implementation dependent
      error code.
    </t>
-->

    <t> Even though ORCHID collisions are expected to be extremely rare,
    two kinds of collisions may still happen. First, it is possible that
    two different input bitstrings within the same context may map to
    the same ORCHID. In this case, the state-set-up mechanism is
    expected to resolve the conflict, for example, by indicating to the
    peer that the ORCHID in question is already in use.</t>

    <t> A second type of collision may happen if two input
    bitstrings, used in different usage contexts, map to the same
    ORCHID. In this case, the main confusion is about which context to
    use. In order to prevent these types of collisions, it is
    RECOMMENDED that implementations that simultaneously support
    multiple different contexts maintain a node-wide unified database of
    known ORCHIDs, and indicate a conflict if any of the mechanisms
    attempt to register an ORCHID that is already in use. For example, if
    a given ORCHID is already being used as a HIT in HIP, it cannot 
    simultaneously be used as a TMI in Mobile IP. Instead, if Mobile IP
    attempts to use the ORCHID, it will be notified (by the kernel) that
    the ORCHID in question is already in use. </t>

<!--
    <t>
      According to the current understanding of the authors, it may
      not be possible to avoid all collisions.  For example, an
      application level protocol may transfer a ORCHID to a new host
      before the state-set-up protocol has a chance to set up the
      needed additional state and detect a possible ORCHID collision.
      If there is already state associated
      with the given ORCHID, the host may interpret its semantics
      wrongly.  This is considered acceptable given the expected
      rarity of the situation and the experimental nature of the name
      space. 
    </t>

  </section>

  <section anchor="sec-design" title="Design Choices">

    <t>
      The design of this namespace faces two competing forces:
<t></t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>As many bits as possible should be preserved for the hash
          result.</t>
        <t>It should be possible to share the namespace 
          between multiple mechanisms.</t>
      </list>
    </t>

    <t>
      The desire to have a long hash result requires that the prefix be
      as short as possible, and use few (if any) bits for
      additional encoding.  The present design takes this desire to
      the maxim: all the bits beyond the prefix are used as hash
      output.  This leaves no bits in the ORCHID itself available for
      identifying the context.  Additionally, due to security
      considerations, the present design REQUIRES that the hash
      function used in constructing ORCHIDs be constant; see
      <xref target="sec-security" />.
    </t>

    <t>
      The authors explicitly considered including a hash-extension
      mechanism, similar to the one in CGA <xref target="RFC3972" />,
      but decided to leave it out.  There were two reasons: desire for
      simplicity, and the somewhat unclear IPR situation around the
      hash-extension mechanism.  If there is a future revision of this
      document, we strongly advise the future authors to reconsider
      the decision.
    </t>

    <t>
      The desire to allow multiple mechanisms to share the namespace
      has been resolved by including the context identifier in the
      hash-function input.  While this does not allow the mechanism to
      be directly inferred from a ORCHID, it allows one to verify that a
      given input bitstring and ORCHID belong to a given context, with
      high-probability; but also see <xref target="sec-security" />.
    </t>

  </section>

  <section anchor="sec-security" title="Security Considerations">

    <t> ORCHIDs are designed to be securely bound to the Context ID
    and the bitstring used as the input parameters during
    their generation. To provide this property, the ORCHID generation
    algorithm relies on the second-preimage resistance (a.k.a. one-way)
    property of the hash function used in the generation <xref
    target="RFC4270"/>. To have this property and to avoid collisions,
    it is important that the allocated prefix is as short as possible,
    leaving as many bits as possible for the hash output. </t>

    <t> For a given Context ID, all mechanisms using ORCHIDs MUST use
    exactly the same mechanism for generating an ORCHID from the input
    bitstring.  Allowing different mechanisms, without explicitly encoding the
    mechanism in the Context ID or the ORCHID itself, would allow
    so-called bidding-down attacks. That is, if multiple different
    hash functions were allowed to construct ORCHIDs valid for the same Context ID,
    and if one of the hash functions became insecure, that would allow attacks
    against even those ORCHIDs valid for the same Context ID that had
    been constructed using the other, still secure hash functions. </t>

    <t> Due to the desire to keep the hash output value as long as possible,
    the hash function is not encoded in the ORCHID itself, but rather in the
    Context ID. Therefore, the present design allows only one method per given
    Context ID for constructing ORCHIDs from input bitstrings.  If other
    methods (perhaps using more secure hash functions) are later needed, they
    MUST use a different Context ID. Consequently, the suggested method to
    react to the hash result becoming too short, due to increased computational
    power, or to the used hash function becoming insecure due to advances in
    cryptology, is to allocate a new Context ID and cease to use the present
    one. </t>

    <t> As of today, SHA1 <xref target="RFC3174"/> is considered as satisfying
    the second-preimage resistance requirement. The current version of the HIP
    specification defines SHA1 <xref target="RFC3174"/> as the hash function to
    be used to generate ORCHIDs for the Context ID used by the HIP protocol
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5201-bis"/>. </t>


  <t> In order to preserve a low enough probability of collisions (see
  <xref target="sec-API-issues" />), each method MUST utilize a
  mechanism that makes sure that the distinct input bitstrings are
  either unique or statistically unique within that context. There are
  several possible methods to ensure this; for example, one can include
  into the input bitstring a globally maintained counter value, a
  pseudo-random number of sufficient entropy (minimum 100 bits), or a
  randomly generated public cryptographic key.
  The Context ID makes sure that input bitstrings from different
  contexts never overlap. These together make sure that the probability
  of collisions is determined only by the probability of natural
  collisions in the hash space and is not increased by a possibility of
  colliding input bitstrings. </t>

  <section anchor="sec-IANA" title="IANA Considerations">

    <t> IANA allocated a temporary non-routable 28-bit prefix
    from the IPv6 address space.  By default, the prefix will be returned to
    IANA in 2014, continued use requiring IETF consensus.

    As per <xref target="RFC4773"/>, the 28-bit prefix was drawn
out of the IANA Special Purpose Address Block, namely 2001:0000::/23, 
in support of the experimental usage described in this document.
IANA has updated the IPv6 Special Purpose Address Registry.
</t><t> 
During the discussions related
    to this document, it was suggested that other identifier spaces may be
    allocated from this block later. However, this document does not
    define such a policy or allocations. </t>

    <t> The Context Identifier (or Context ID) is a randomly generated
    value defining the usage context of an ORCHID and the hash function to
    be used for generation of ORCHIDs in this context. This document defines
    no specific value. </t>

    <t> We propose sharing the name
    space introduced for CGA Type Tags. Hence, defining new values would
    follow the rules of Section 8 of <xref target="RFC3972" />, i.e., on
    a First Come First Served basis.

    <t> Special thanks to Geoff Huston for his sharp but constructive
    critique during the development of this memo. Tom Henderson helped to
    clarify a number of issues. This document has also been improved by reviews, comments, 
    and discussions originating from the IPv6, 
    Internet Area, and IETF communities.</t>

  <section title="Version history">
    <section title="-00 to -01">

      <t> The name Keyed Hash Identifier (KHI) was replaced with Overlay
      Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifier (ORCHID). However, the
      draft name was not changed.</t>

      <t> More text added to explain the rationale behind the proposed
      allocation.</t>

      <t> Text changed to emphasise that while ORCHIDs are expected to
      be non-routable at the IP-layer, they are expected to become fully
      routable and/or resolvable at some upper, overlay layer, thereby
      making their basic semantics fully compatible with IPv6 addresses.
      </t>
      
       <t> Removed the proposed expiration date. If such an expiration
      date is needed, it can be added later during the discussions.</t>

<abstract><t>This draft presents a simple privacy extension for Mobile
IPv6 that prevents eavesdroppers from identifying the packets sent or
received from a particular mobile node. This extension also allows a
mobile node to hide its identity from correspondent nodes when the
mobile node initiates the communication.</t></abstract>

    This document defines a rendezvous extension for the Host Identity
    Protocol (HIP).  The rendezvous extension extends HIP and the HIP
    registration extension for initiating communication between HIP nodes
    via HIP rendezvous servers.  Rendezvous servers improve reachability and operation when
    HIP nodes are multi-homed or mobile.

<section title="Introduction">
<t>
    The <xref target="RFC4423">Host Identity
        Protocol (HIP) Architecture</xref> introduces
    the rendezvous mechanism to help a HIP node to contact a frequently moving HIP node.
    The rendezvous mechanism involves a third party, the rendezvous server (RVS), which 
    serves as an initial contact point ("rendezvous point") for its clients. 
    The clients of an RVS are HIP nodes that use the
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5203-bis">HIP Registration
        Extension</xref> to register their HIT-&gt;IP address mappings
        with the RVS.  After this registration, other HIP nodes can
        initiate a base exchange using the IP address of the RVS
        instead of the current IP address of the node they attempt to
        contact.  Essentially, the clients of an RVS become reachable
        at the RVS's IP address.  Peers can initiate a HIP base exchange with the IP address of the RVS, which will relay this initial communication such that the base exchange may successfully complete.

<section title="Overview of Rendezvous Server Operation">
<t>
    <xref target="base-ex"/> shows a simple HIP base exchange without
    a rendezvous server, in which the initiator initiates the exchange
    directly with the responder by sending an I1 packet to the responder's IP
    address, as per the <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5201-bis">HIP specification </xref>.

    The <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5206-bis">End-Host Mobility and Multihoming with the 
	Host Identity Protocol specification</xref> allows a HIP node to notify its peers
    about changes in its set of IP addresses.  This specification presumes
initial reachability of the two nodes with respect to each other.

</t>

<t>
    
    However, such a HIP node MAY also want to be reachable to
    other future correspondent peers that are unaware of its location change.
    The <xref target="RFC4423"> HIP Architecture</xref>
    introduces rendezvous servers with whom a HIP node MAY register its host identity tags (HITs)
    and current IP addresses.  An RVS relays HIP packets arriving for these HITs to the
    node's registered IP addresses.  When a HIP node has registered with an RVS, it SHOULD
    record the IP address of its RVS in its DNS record, using the HIP DNS resource record type
    defined in the <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5205-bis">HIP DNS Extension</xref>.

    <xref target="lookup-rvs"/> shows a HIP base exchange involving a
    rendezvous server.  It is assumed that HIP node R previously registered its HITs and current IP addresses with the RVS, using the <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5203-bis">HIP Registration
    Extension</xref>. 
When the initiator I tries to establish contact with the responder R, it must
send the I1 of the base exchange either to one of R's IP addresses (if known
via DNS or other means) or to one of R's rendezvous servers.
Here, I obtains the IP address of R's rendezvous server from R's DNS record and then sends the I1 packet of the HIP base exchange to RVS.  RVS, noticing that the HIT contained in the arriving I1 packet is not one of its own, MUST check its current registrations to determine if it needs to relay the packets.  Here, it determines that the HIT belongs to R and then relays the I1 packet to the registered IP address.  R then completes the base exchange without further assistance from RVS by
    sending an R1 directly to the I's IP address, as obtained from the I1 packet.
    In this specification, the client of the RVS is always the responder. 
However, there might be reasons to allow a client to initiate a base exchange through its own RVS, like NAT and firewall traversal.  This specification does
not address such scenarios, which should be specified in other documents.

<section title="Relaying the Base Exchange">

<t>

    If a HIP node and one of its rendezvous servers have a rendezvous registration,
    the rendezvous servers relay inbound I1 packets (that contain one of the client's HITs) by rewriting the IP header.  They replace the destination
    IP address of the I1 packet with one of the IP addresses of the owner of the HIT, i.e., the rendezvous client.  They MUST also recompute the IP checksum accordingly.</t>

<t> Because of egress filtering on the path from the RVS to the client <xref target="RFC2827"/><xref target="RFC3013"/>, a HIP rendezvous server SHOULD
    replace the source IP address, i.e., the IP address of I, with one of its own IP
    addresses.  The replacement IP address SHOULD be chosen according to relevant IPv4 and IPv6 
    specifications <xref target="RFC1122"/><xref target="RFC3484"/>.  Because this replacement conceals the initiator's IP address, the RVS MUST append a FROM parameter containing the original source IP address of the packet.
    This FROM parameter MUST be integrity protected by an RVS_HMAC keyed with the corresponding
    rendezvous registration integrity key <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5203-bis"/>.

    <t>

This modification of HIP packets at a rendezvous server can be problematic because
        the HIP protocol uses integrity checks.
Because the I1 does not include HMAC
        or SIGNATURE parameters, these two end-to-end integrity checks are unaffected by the
	operation of rendezvous servers.

    </t>
        
        <t> 
      
            The RVS SHOULD verify the checksum field of an I1 packet before doing any modifications.  After modification, it MUST recompute the checksum field using the
            updated HIP header, which possibly included new FROM and RVS_HMAC parameters,
            and a pseudo-header containing the updated source and destination IP addresses.
            This enables the responder to validate the checksum of the I1 packet "as is", without
            having to parse any FROM parameters.

        After the responder receives a relayed I1 packet, it can begin to
        send HIP packets addressed to the initiator's IP
        address, without further assistance from an
        RVS.  For debugging purposes, it MAY include a subset
        of the IP addresses of its RVSs in some of these packets. 
        When a responder does so, it MUST append a newly created VIA_RVS parameter at
                the end of the HIP packet.
        The main goal of using the VIA_RVS parameter is
        to allow operators to diagnose possible issues encountered
        while establishing a HIP association via an RVS.

<section title="Modified Packets Processing">
<t>
The following subsections describe the differences of processing of I1
and R1 while a rendezvous server is involved in the base exchange.
</t>

<section title="Processing Outgoing I1 Packets">
<t>
An initiator SHOULD NOT send an opportunistic I1 with a NULL
destination HIT to an IP address that is known to be a rendezvous
server address, unless it wants to establish a HIP association with the
rendezvous server itself and does not know its HIT.
</t>

<?rfc needLines="5" ?>  

<t>
When an RVS rewrites the source IP address of an I1 packet due to egress filtering,
it MUST add a FROM parameter to the I1 that contains the initiator's source IP address.  This FROM parameter MUST be protected by an RVS_HMAC keyed with the integrity key established at rendezvous registration.
</t>
    </section>

<section title="Processing Incoming I1 Packets">
<t> 
When a rendezvous server receives an I1 whose destination HIT is not its own, it
consults its registration database to find a registration for the rendezvous service
established by the HIT owner.  If it finds an appropriate registration, it relays the packet to the registered IP address.  If it does not find an appropriate registration, it drops the packet.
</t>    

<t>
    A rendezvous server SHOULD interpret any incoming opportunistic I1
    (i.e., an I1 with a NULL destination HIT) as an I1 addressed to itself and SHOULD NOT
    attempt to relay it to one of its clients.
</t>

<t>
When a rendezvous client receives an I1, it MUST validate any present RVS_HMAC parameter.
If the RVS_HMAC cannot be verified, the packet SHOULD be dropped.  If the RVS_HMAC cannot be
verified and a FROM parameter is present, the packet MUST be dropped.
</t>
<t>
A rendezvous client acting as responder SHOULD drop opportunistic I1s that 
include a FROM parameter, because this indicates that the I1 has been
relayed.
</t>

    </section>

<section title="Processing Outgoing R1 Packets">
<t>
When a responder replies to an I1 relayed via an RVS, it 
MUST append to the regular R1 header a VIA_RVS parameter containing the
IP addresses of the traversed RVSs. 
</t>

</section>

<section title="Processing Incoming R1 Packets">
<t> 

   The <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-rfc5201-bis">HIP specification</xref> mandates
that a system receiving an R1 MUST first check to see if it has sent an I1 to
the originator of the R1 (i.e., the system is in state I1-SENT).  When the R1 is
replying to a relayed I1, this check SHOULD be based on HITs only.  In case the IP
addresses are also checked, then the source IP address MUST be checked against
the IP address included in the VIA_RVS parameter.

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>


    This section discusses the known threats introduced by these HIP extensions
and the implications on the overall security of HIP.  In particular, it
argues that the extensions described in this document do not introduce
additional threats to the Host Identity Protocol.

</t>
<t>

    It is difficult to encompass the whole scope of threats introduced by
    rendezvous servers because their presence has implications both at
    the IP and HIP layers.  In particular, these extensions  
    might allow for redirection, amplification, and reflection attacks at the
    IP layer, as well as attacks on the HIP layer itself, for example,
    man-in-the-middle attacks against the HIP base exchange.
    
</t>
<t>

    If an initiator has a priori knowledge of the responder's host identity 
    when it first contacts the responder via an RVS, it has a means to verify
    the signatures in the HIP base exchange, which protects
    against man-in-the-middle attacks.
    
</t>
<t>

    If an initiator does not have a priori knowledge of the responder's host identity (so-called "opportunistic initiators"), it is almost impossible to defend the HIP
    exchange against these attacks, because the public keys exchanged cannot be authenticated.  The
    only approach would be to mitigate hijacking threats on HIP state by
    requiring an R1 answering an opportunistic I1 to come from the same IP address that originally sent the I1.  This procedure retains a level of security that is equivalent to what exists in the Internet today. 
    
</t>
<t>

    However, for reasons of simplicity, this specification does not allow the
    establishment of a HIP association via a rendezvous server in an opportunistic manner.

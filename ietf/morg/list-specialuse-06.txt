             IMAP LIST extension for special-use mailboxes
                   draft-ietf-morg-list-specialuse-06

Abstract

   Some IMAP message stores include special-use mailboxes, such as those
   used to hold draft messages or sent messages.  Many mail clients
   allow users to specify where draft or sent messages should be put,
   but configuring them requires that the user know which mailboxes the
   server has set aside for these purposes.  This extension adds new
   optional mailbox attributes that a server may include in IMAP LIST
   command responses to identify special-use mailboxes to the client,
   easing configuration.

Internet-Draft      IMAP LIST: special-use mailboxes       December 2010


1.  Introduction

   Some IMAP message stores include special-use mailboxes, such as those
   used to hold draft messages or sent messages.  Many mail clients
   allow users to specify where draft or sent messages should be put,
   but configuring them requires that the user know which mailboxes the
   server has set aside for these purposes.  This extension adds new
   optional mailbox attributes that a server may include in IMAP LIST
   command responses to identify special-use mailboxes to the client,
   easing configuration.

   In addition, this extension adds an optional parameter on the IMAP
   CREATE command, allowing a client to assign a special use to a
   mailbox when it is created.  Servers may choose to support this part
   of the extension, but are not required to.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected
   to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  New mailbox attributes identifying special-use mailboxes

   An IMAP server that supports this extension MAY include any or all of
   the following attributes in responses to the non-extended IMAP LIST
   command.  The new attributes are included along with existing
   attributes, such as "\Marked" and "\Noselect".  A given mailbox may
   have none, one, or more than one of these attributes.  In some cases,
   a special use is advice to a client about what to put in that
   mailbox.  In other cases, it's advice to a client about what to
   expect to find there.  There is no capability string related to the
   support of special-use attributes on the non-extended LIST command.

   For the extended list command [RFC5258], this extension adds a new
   capability string, a new selection option, and a new return option,
   all called "SPECIAL-USE".  Supporting implementations MUST include
   the "SPECIAL-USE" capability string in response to an IMAP CAPABILITY
   command.  If the client specifies the "SPECIAL-USE" selection option,
   the LIST command MUST return only those mailboxes that have a
   special-use attribute set.  If the client specifies the "SPECIAL-USE"
   return option, the LIST command MUST return the new special-use
   attributes on those mailboxes that have them set.  The "SPECIAL-USE"
   return option is implied by the "SPECIAL-USE" selection option.  The

Internet-Draft      IMAP LIST: special-use mailboxes       December 2010


   extended LIST command MAY return SPECIAL-USE attributes even if the
   client does not specify the return option.

   The new attributes defined here are as follows:

   \Drafts
        This mailbox is used to hold draft messages -- typically,
        messages that are being composed but have not yet been sent.  In
        some server implementations, this might be a virtual mailbox,
        containing messages from other mailboxes that are marked with
        the "\Draft" message flag.  Alternatively, this might just be
        advice that a client put drafts here.

   \Flagged
        This mailbox presents all messages marked in some way as
        "important".  When this special use is supported, it is likely
        to represent a virtual mailbox collecting messages (from other
        mailboxes) that are marked with the "\Flagged" message flag.

   \Junk
        This mailbox is where messages deemed to be junk mail are held.
        Some server implementations might put messages here
        automatically.  Alternatively, this might just be advice to a
        client-side spam filter.

   \Sent
        This mailbox is used to hold copies of messages that have been
        sent.  Some server implementations might put messages here
        automatically.  Alternatively, this might just be advice that a
        client save sent messages here.

   \Trash
        This mailbox is used to hold messages that have been deleted, or
        marked for deletion.  In some server implementations, this might
        be a virtual mailbox, containing messages from other mailboxes
        that are marked with the "\Deleted" message flag.
        Alternatively, this might just be advice that a client that
        chooses not to use the IMAP "\Deleted" model should use this as
        its trash location.  In server implementations that strictly
        expect the IMAP "\Deleted" model, this special use is likely not
        to be supported.

   \All
        This mailbox presents all messages in the user's message store.
        Implementations MAY omit some messages, such as, perhaps, those
        in \Trash and \Junk.  When this special use is supported, it is
        almost certain to represent a virtual mailbox.

Internet-Draft      IMAP LIST: special-use mailboxes       December 2010


   \Archive
        This mailbox is used to archive messages.  The meaning of an
        "archival" mailbox is server-dependent; typically, it will be
        used to get messages out of the inbox, or otherwise keep them
        out of the user's way, while still making them accessible.

   All of the above attributes are OPTIONAL, and any given server or
   message store may support any combination of the attributes, or none
   at all.  In most cases there will likely be at most one mailbox with
   a given attribute for a given user, but in some server or message
   store implementations it might be possible for multiple mailboxes to
   have the same special-use attribute.

   Special-use attributes are likely to be user-specific.  User Adam
   might share his \Sent mailbox with user Barb, but that mailbox is
   unlikely to also serve as Barb's \Sent mailbox.  It's certainly
   possible for Adam and Barb to each set the \Sent use on the same
   mailbox, but that would be done by specific action (see the sections
   below).


3.  Extension to IMAP CREATE command to set special-use attributes

   As an OPTIONAL feature, a server MAY allow clients to designate a
   mailbox, at creation, as having one or more special uses.  This
   extension defines the "USE" parameter to the IMAP CREATE command for
   that purpose (using the syntax defined in RFC 4466 section 2.2
   [RFC4466]).  The new OPTIONAL "USE" parameter is followed by a
   parenthesized list of zero or more special-use attributes, as defined
   above.

   In some server implementations, some special uses may imply automatic
   action by the server.  For example, creation of a "\Junk" mailbox
   might cause the server to start placing messages that have been
   evaluated as spam into the mailbox.

   In some server implementations, some special uses may result in a
   mailbox with unusual characteristics or side effects.  For example,
   creation of an "\All" mailbox might cause the server to create a
   virtual mailbox, rather than a standard one, and that mailbox might
   behave in unexpected ways (COPY into it might fail, for example).

   Servers MAY allow the creation of a special-use mailbox even if one
   so designated already exists, having the effect of moving the special
   use from the old mailbox to the new one.  Alternatively, servers MAY
   refuse the creation, considering the designation to be a conflict.

   If the server can not create a mailbox with the designated special



Leiba & Nicolson          Expires June 18, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      IMAP LIST: special-use mailboxes       December 2010


   use defined, for whatever reason, it MUST NOT create the mailbox, and
   MUST respond to the CREATE command with a tagged NO response.  If the
   reason for the failure is related to the special-use attribute (the
   specified special use is not supported or cannot be assigned to the
   specified mailbox), the server SHOULD include the new "USEATTR"
   response code in the tagged response (see Section 5.3 for an
   example).

   An IMAP server that supports this OPTIONAL feature will advertise the
   CREATE-SPECIAL-USE capability string.  Clients MUST NOT use the "USE"
   parameter unless the server advertises the capability.  Note that
   this capability string is different from the SPECIAL-USE string
   defined above, and a server that supports both functions MUST
   advertise both capability strings.


4.  IMAP METADATA entry for special-use attributes

   If a server supports this extension and the METADATA extension
   [RFC5464], it SHOULD tie the special-use attributes for a mailbox to
   its metadata entry "/shared/specialuse".  The value of /shared/
   specialuse is either NIL (if there are no special-use attributes for
   that mailbox) or a space-separated list of special-use attributes,
   presented the same way they would be presented in the LIST command
   response.

   Such a server MAY allow the setting of special-use attributes through
   the METADATA mechanisms, thereby allowing clients to change the
   special uses of existing mailboxes.  These changes might have side
   effects, as the server automatically adjusts the special uses
   accordingly, just as it might do with CREATE USE, above.  See
   Section 5.4 for an example.

   A server that supports this MUST check the validity of changes to the
   special-use attributes that are done through the metadata in the same
   way that it checks validity for the CREATE command and for any
   internal mechanisms for setting special uses on mailboxes.  It MUST
   NOT just blindly accept setting of these metadata by clients, which
   might result in the setting of special uses that the implementation
   does not support, multiple mailboxes with the same special use, or
   other situations that the implementation considers invalid.

5.1.  Example of an IMAP LIST command

   This example shows an IMAP LIST response from a server that supports
   this extension.  Note that not all of the attributes are used.  This
   server also supports the Child Mailbox extension [RFC3348].

     C: t1 LIST "" "%"
     S: * LIST (\Marked \HasNoChildren) "/" Inbox
     S: * LIST (\HasNoChildren) "/" ToDo
     S: * LIST (\HasChildren) "/" Projects
     S: * LIST (\Sent \HasNoChildren) "/" SentMail
     S: * LIST (\Marked \Drafts \HasNoChildren) "/" MyDrafts
     S: * LIST (\Trash \HasNoChildren) "/" Trash
     S: t1 OK done

5.2.  Example of an extended IMAP LIST command

   This example shows an IMAP LIST response from a server that supports
   this extension.  The client uses the extended IMAP LIST command.

     C: t1 CAPABILITY
     S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 SPECIAL-USE
     S: t1 OK done

     C: t2 LIST "" "%" RETURN (SPECIAL-USE)
     S: * LIST (\Marked) "/" Inbox
     S: * LIST () "/" ToDo
     S: * LIST () "/" Projects
     S: * LIST (\Sent) "/" SentMail
     S: * LIST (\Marked \Drafts) "/" MyDrafts
     S: * LIST (\Trash) "/" Trash
     S: t2 OK done

   Here, the client also includes the "SPECIAL-USE" selection option for
   the same list.  The "SPECIAL-USE" return option could also have been
   specified, but it is unnecessary, as it is implied by the selection
   option.  Note that in this case, mailboxes that do not have a
   special-use attribute are not listed.  Also note that we've used the
   wildcard "*", rather than "%", to make sure we see all special-use
   mailboxes, even ones that might not be at the namespace's root.

     C: t3 LIST (SPECIAL-USE) "" "*"
     S: * LIST (\Sent) "/" SentMail
     S: * LIST (\Marked \Drafts) "/" MyDrafts
     S: * LIST (\Trash) "/" Trash
     S: t3 OK done

5.3.  Example of an IMAP CREATE command

   This example shows an IMAP CREATE command that might be used to
   create a mailbox designated to hold draft and sent messages.  It also
   attempts to create a mailbox that will contain all the user's
   messages, but the server does not support that special use for this
   user's message store.

     C: t1 CAPABILITY
     S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 CREATE-SPECIAL-USE
     S: t1 OK done

     C: t2 CREATE MySpecial (USE (\Drafts \Sent))
     S: t2 OK MySpecial created

     C: t3 CREATE Everything (USE (\All))
     S: t3 NO [USEATTR] \All not supported

5.4.  Example of using IMAP METADATA to manipulate special-use
      attributes

   This example shows how IMAP METADATA can be used to manipulate
   special-use attributes, if the operation is supported on the server.

7.  Security Considerations

   LIST response: There are no security issues with conveying special-
   use information to a client.

   CREATE command "USE" parameter and metadata extension: In some server
   implementations, some special uses may imply automatic action by the
   server.  For example, creation of a "\Junk" mailbox might cause the
   server to start placing messages that have been evaluated as spam
   into the mailbox.  Implementors SHOULD consider the consequences of
   allowing a user (or client program) to designate the target of such
   automatic action.

   Example: If a user is allowed to give the "\Junk" attribute to a
   shared mailbox, legitimate mail that's misclassified as junk (false
   positives) will be put into that shared mailbox, exposing the user's
   private mail to others.  The server might warn a user of that
   possibility, or might refuse to allow the specification to be made on
   a shared mailbox.  (Note that this problem exists independent of this
   specification, if the server allows a user to share a mailbox that's
   already in use for such a function.)

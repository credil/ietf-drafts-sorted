        The IMAP4 specification allows the searching only of the selected
        mailbox.  A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a
        client that wishes to support this must issue a series of SELECT and
        SEARCH commands, waiting for each to complete before moving on to the
        next.  This extension allows a client to search multiple mailboxes
        with one command, limiting the round-trips and waiting for various
        searches to complete, and not requiring disruption of the currently
        selected mailbox.  This also uses MAILBOX and TAG fields in
        ESEARCH responses, allowing a client to pipeline the searches if it chooses.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The IMAP4 specification allows the searching only of the selected
        mailbox.  A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a
        client that wishes to support this must issue a series of SELECT and
        SEARCH commands, waiting for each to complete before moving on to the
        next.  The commands can't be pipelined, because the server might run
        them in parallel, and the untagged SEARCH responses could not then
        be distinguished from each other.
      </t>

      <t>
        This extension allows a client to search multiple mailboxes
        with one command, and includes MAILBOX and TAG fields in the ESEARCH response,
        yielding the following advantages:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            A single command limits the number of round-trips needed to search
            a set of mailboxes.
          </t>
          <t>
            A single command eliminates the need to wait for one search to complete
            before starting the next.
          </t>
          <t>
            A single command allows the server to optimize the search, if it can.
          </t>
          <t>
            A command that is not dependent upon the selected mailbox eliminates the
            need to disrupt the selection state, or to open another IMAP connection.
          </t>
          <t>
            The MAILBOX and TAG fields in the responses allow a client to distinguish
            which responses go with which search (and which mailbox).
            A client can safely pipeline these search commands without danger of confusion.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <section title="Conventions used in this document">
        <t>
          In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected

        </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        This section defines a new ESEARCH command, which works similarly to
        the UID SEARCH command described in section 2.6.1 of <xref target="RFC4466"/>
        (initially described in section 6.4.4 of <xref target="RFC3501"/>
        and extended by <xref target="RFC4731"/>).
      </t>

      <t>
        The ESEARCH command further extends searching by allowing for
        optional source and result options.
        This document does not define any new result options
        (see Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC4731"/>).
        A server that supports this extension includes
        <cref anchor="fix-for-pub-1">"X-DRAFT-I05-MMBX" (changes for publication)</cref>
        in its IMAP capability string.        
      </t>

      <t>
        Because there has been confusion about this, it is worth pointing out
        that with ESEARCH, as with *any* SEARCH or UID SEARCH command, it MUST NOT
        be considered an error if the search terms include a range of message
        numbers that extends (or, in fact, starts) beyond the end of the mailbox.
        For example, a client might want to establish a rolling window through
        the search results this way:
      </t>

      <t>
        C: tag1 UID ESEARCH FROM "frobozz" 1:100
      </t>

      <t>
        ...followed later by this:
      </t>

      <t>
        C: tag1 UID ESEARCH FROM "frobozz" 101:200
      </t>

      <t>
        ...and so on.  This tells the server to match only the first hundred messages
        in the mailbox the first time, the second hundred the second time, etc.
        In fact, it might likely allow the server to optimize the search significantly.
        In the above example, whether the mailbox contains 50 or 150 or 250 messages,
        neither of the search commands shown will result in an error.  It is up to
        the client to know when to stop moving its search window.
      </t>

      <t>
      </t>

      <section title="The ESEARCH response">
        <t>
          In response to an ESEARCH command,
          the server MUST return ESEARCH responses <xref target="RFC4731"/>
          (that is, not SEARCH responses).
          Because message numbers are not useful for mailboxes that are not selected,          
          the responses MUST contain information about UIDs, not message numbers.
          This is true even if the source options specify that only the selected mailbox
          be searched.
        </t>

        <t>
          Presence of a source option in absence of a result option implies the "ALL" result
          option (see Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC4731"/>).  Note that this is not the same
          as the result from the SEARCH command described in the IMAP base protocol.
        </t>

        <t>
          Source options describe which mailboxes must be searched for messages.
          An ESEARCH command with source options does not affect which
          mailbox, if any, is currently selected, regardless of which mailboxes are searched.
        </t>

        <t>
          For each mailbox satisfying the source options, a single
          ESEARCH response MUST be returned
          if any messages in that mailbox match the search criteria.
          An ESEARCH response MUST NOT
          be returned for mailboxes that contain no matching messages.
          This is true even when result options such as MIN, MAX, and COUNT are specified
          (see section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC4731"/>), and the values returned
          (lowest UID matched, highest UID matched, and number of messages matched,
          respectively) apply to the mailbox reported in that ESEARCH response.
        </t>

        <t>
          Note that it is possible for an ESEARCH command to return *no* untagged responses
          (no ESEARCH responses at all), in the case that there are no matches to the search
          in any of the mailboxes that satisfy the source options.
          Clients can detect this situation by finding the tagged OK response without having
          received any matching untagged ESEARCH responses.
        </t>

        <t>
          Each ESEARCH response MUST contain the MAILBOX, TAG, and UIDVALIDITY correlators.
          Correlators allow clients to issue several ESEARCH commands at once (pipelined).
          If the SEARCHRES <xref target="RFC5182"/> extension is used in an ESEARCH
          command, that ESEARCH command MUST be executed by the server after all previous
          SEARCH/ESEARCH commands have completed, and before any subsequent SEARCH/ESEARCH
          commands are executed.
          The server MAY perform consecutive ESEARCH commands in parallel
          as long as none of them use the SEARCHRES extension.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Source options: specifying mailboxes to search">
        <t>
          The source options, if present, MUST contain a mailbox specifier
          as defined in the IMAP NOTIFY extension <xref target="RFC5465"/>,
          section 6 (using the "filter-mailboxes" ABNF item), with the
          following differences:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>
              The "selected-delayed" specifier is not valid here.
            </t>
            <t>
              A "subtree-one" specifier is added.  The "subtree" specifier
              results in a search of the specified mailbox and all selectable
              mailboxes that are subordinate to it, through an indefinitely
              deep hierarchy.
              The "subtree-one" specifier results in a search of
              the specified mailbox and all selectable child mailboxes,
              one hierarchy level down.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          If "subtree" is specified, the server MUST defend against loops
          in the hierarchy (for example, those caused by recursive file-system
          links within the message store).
          The server SHOULD do this by keeping track of the mailboxes that have
          been searched, and terminating the hierarchy traversal when a repeat
          is found.
          If it can not do that, it MAY do it by limiting the hierarchy depth.
        </t>

        <t>
          If the source options are not present, the value "selected" is
          assumed -- that is, only the currently selected mailbox is searched.
        </t>

        <t>
          The "personal" source option is a particularly convenient way to search all of
          the current user's mailboxes.
          Note that there is no way to use wildcard characters to search all mailboxes;
          the "mailboxes" source option does not do wildcard expansion.
        </t>

        <t>
          If the source options include (or default to) "selected",
          the IMAP session MUST be in "selected" state.
          If the source options specify other mailboxes and NOT "selected",
          then the IMAP session MUST be in either "selected" or "authenticated" state.
          If the session is not in a correct state,
          the ESEARCH command MUST return a "BAD" result.
        </t>

        <t>
          If the server supports the SEARCHRES <xref target="RFC5182"/> extension, then
          the "SAVE" result option is valid *only* if "selected" is specified
          or defaulted as the sole mailbox to be searched.
          If any source option other than "selected" is specified,
          the ESEARCH command MUST return a "BAD" result.
        </t>
	  
	  
        <t>
          If the server supports the CONTEXT=SEARCH and/or CONTEXT=SORT extension
          <xref target="RFC5267"/>, then the following additional rules apply:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              The CONTEXT return option (Section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC5267"/>) can be used
              with an ESEARCH command.
            </t>
		
            <t>
              If the UPDATE return option is used (Section 4.3 of <xref target="RFC5267"/>),
              it MUST apply ONLY to the the currently selected mailbox.
              If UPDATE is used and there is no mailbox currently selected,
              the ESEARCH command MUST return a "BAD" result.
            </t>

            <t>
              The PARTIAL search return option (Section 4.4 of <xref target="RFC5267"/>)
              can be used and applies to each mailbox searched by the ESEARCH command.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          If the server supports the ACL <xref target="RFC4314"/> extension, then
          the logged in user is required to have the 'r' right for each mailbox
          she wants to search.
          In addition, any mailboxes that are not explicitly named
          (accessed through "personal" or "subtree", for example) are required
          to have the "l" right.
          Mailboxes matching the source options for which
          the logged in user lacks sufficient rights MUST be ignored
          by the ESEARCH command processing.
          In particular, ESEARCH responses MUST NOT be returned for those mailboxes.
        </t>
      </section>

    <section anchor="examples" title="Examples">
      <t>
        In the following example, note that two ESEARCH commands are pipelined,

      <t>
        This new IMAP ESEARCH command allows a single command to search many
        mailboxes at once.
        On the one hand, a client could do that by sending many IMAP SEARCH commands.
        On the other hand, this makes it easier for a client to overwork a
        server, by sending a single command that results in an expensive search
        of tens of thousands of mailboxes.
        Server implementations need to be aware of that, and provide mechanisms
        that prevent a client from adversely affecting other users.
        Limitations on the number of mailboxes that may be searched in one command, and/or
        on the server resources that will be devoted to responding to a single client,
        are reasonable limitations for an implementation to impose.
      </t>            
      <t>
        Implementations MUST, of course, apply access controls appropriately,
        limiting a user's access to ESEARCH in the same way its access is
        limited for any other IMAP commands.
        This extension has no data-access risks beyond what may be there in the unextended
        IMAP implementation.

        IMAP4 capabilities are registered by publishing a standards track or
        IESG approved experimental RFC.  The registry is currently located here:

        This document defines the IMAP capability
        <cref anchor="fix-for-pub-2">X-DRAFT-I03-MMBX (changes for publication)</cref>,
        and IANA is asked to add it to the registry.

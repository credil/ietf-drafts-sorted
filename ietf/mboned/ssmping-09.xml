    <abstract><t>The Multicast Ping Protocol specified
in this document allows for checking whether an endpoint can receive
multicast, both Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) and Any-Source
Multicast (ASM). It can also be used to obtain additional
multicast-related information such as multicast tree setup time.
This protocol is based on an implementation of tools
called ssmping and asmping.

		        <t>The Multicast Ping Protocol specified in this
document allows for checking multicast connectivity. In addition to
checking reception of multicast (SSM or ASM), the protocol can provide
related information such as multicast tree setup time, the number of hops
the packets have traveled, as well as packet delay and loss.
This functionality resembles, in part, the ICMP Echo Request/Reply
mechanism <xref target="RFC0792"/>, but uses UDP <xref target="RFC0768"/>
and requires both
a client and a server implementing this protocol.
Intermediate routers are not required to support this protocol. They
forward Protocol Messages and data traffic as usual.
</t><t>
This protocol is based on the current implementation of
the ssmping and asmping tools <xref target="impl"/> which are widely
used by the Internet community to conduct multicast connectivity tests.
</t>
                </section>
                <section title="Architecture" anchor="arch">
<t>Before describing the protocol in detail, we provide a brief
overview of how the protocol may be used and what information it may
provide.
</t><t>
The protocol is used between clients and servers to check multicast
connectivity. Servers are multicast sources and clients are
multicast receivers. A server may be
configured with a set of ranges of multicast addresses that can be
used for testing, or it may use some implementation defaults.
Depending on the server configuration or the implementation it may
control which clients
(which unicast addresses) are allowed to use different group ranges,
and also whether clients can select a group address, or if the
group address is selected by the server. It also depends on
configuration and/or implementation whether several clients are
allowed to simultaneously use the same multicast address.
</t><t>
In addition to the above state, a server normally has runtime
soft state. The server must generally perform rate limiting to
restrict the number of client requests it handles. This rate
limiting is per client IP address. This state need usually only be
maintained for a few seconds, depending on the limit used.
If the server provides unique
multicast addresses to clients, it must also have soft state tracking
which multicast addresses are used by which client IP address. This
state should expire if the server has not received requests within
a few minutes. The exact timeout should ideally be configurable to
cope with different environments. If a client is expected to perform
multicast ping checks continuously for a long period of time, and to
cope with requests not reaching the client for several minutes, then
this timeout needs to be extended. In order to verify the client IP
address, the server should perform a return routability check by
giving the client a non-predictable session ID. This would then also
be part of the server soft-state for that client.
</t><t>
A client must before it can perform a multicast ping test, know the
unicast address of a server. In addition it may be
configured with a multicast address or range to use. In
that case the client will tell the server which group or range it
wishes to use. If not, the server is left to decide the group.
Normally a client sends Default-Client-Request-Rate requests per second.
It may however be configured to use another rate. See definition
of Default-Client-Request-Rate in <xref target="mrv"/>.
Note that the value can be less than 1.
</t><t>
At runtime, a client generates a client ID that is unique for the
ping test. This ID is included in all messages sent by the client.
Further, if not supplied with a specific group address, the client
will receive a group address from the server, that is used for the
ping requests. It may also receive a Session ID from the server.
The client ID, group address and Session ID (if received) will then
be fixed for all ping requests in this session. When a client
receives replies from a server, it will verify the client ID in the
reply, and ignore it if not matching what it used in the requests.
For each reply it may print or record information like round trip
time, number of hops etc. The client may once a ping session is
ended, calculate and print or record statistics based on the entire
ping session.
</t>
                  <t><list style="hanging">
                    <t hangText="The typical protocol usage is as follows:">
	              <vspace blankLines="1"/>
A server runs continuously to serve requests from clients. A client
has somehow learned the unicast address of the server and tests
the multicast reception from the server.
	              <vspace blankLines="1"/>
The client application will then send
a unicast message to the server asking for a group to use. Optionally
a user may request a specific group or scope, in which case
the client will ask for a group matching the user's request. The
server will respond with a group to use, or an error if no group is
available.
	              <vspace blankLines="1"/>
Next, for ASM, the client joins an ASM group G, while for
SSM it joins a channel (S,G), where G is the multicast group address
specified by the
server, and S is the unicast address used to reach the server.
	              <vspace blankLines="1"/>
After joining the group/channel, the client unicasts multicast ping
requests to the server. The requests are sent using UDP with the
destination port set to the standardised multicast ping port [TBD]. The
requests are sent periodically to the server. The rate is by default
Default-Client-Request-Rate <xref target="mrv"/> requests per second,
but the client may be
configured to use another rate. These requests contain
a sequence number, and typically a timestamp. The requests are echoed
by the server, which may add a few options.
	              <vspace blankLines="1"/>
For each request, the server sends two replies.
One reply is unicast to the source IP address and source UDP port of
the requesting client. The other reply is multicast to the requested
multicast group G and the source UDP port of the requesting client.
	              <vspace blankLines="1"/>
Both replies are sent from the same port on which the request was received.
The server should specify the TTL (IPv4 time-to-live or IPv6 hop-count)
used for both the unicast and multicast messages
(TTL of at least 64 is recommended) by including a TTL option.
This allows the client
to compute the number of hops. The client should leave the group/channel
when it has finished its measurements.
                    </t>
                  </list></t>
<t>
By use of this protocol, a client (or a user of the client) can obtain
information about
several multicast delivery characteristics. First, by receiving
unicast replies, the client can verify that the server is receiving the
unicast requests, is operational and responding. Hence, provided that
the client receives unicast replies, a failure to receive multicast
indicates either a multicast problem or a multicast administrative
restriction. If it does receive multicast, it knows not only
that it can receive multicast traffic, it may also estimate the amount
of time it took to
establish the multicast tree (at least if it is in the
range of seconds), whether there are packet drops, and the length
and variation of Round Trip Times (RTT).
</t><t>
For unicast, the RTT is the
time from when the unicast request is sent to the time when the reply
is received.
The measured multicast RTT also references the client's unicast
request. By specifying the TTL of the replies when
they are originated, the client can also determine the number of router
hops it is from the source. Since similar information is obtained in
the unicast replies, the host may compare its multicast and unicast
results and is able to check for differences such as the number of hops,
and RTT.
</t><t>
The number of multicast hops and changes in the number of
hops over time may reveal details about the multicast tree and
multicast tree changes. Provided that the server sends the unicast
and multicast replies nearly simultaneously, the client may also be able to
measure the difference in one way delay for unicast and multicast on the
path from server to client, and also differences in
delay.
</t><t>
Servers may optionally specify a timestamp.
This may be useful since the unicast and multicast
replies can not be sent simultaneously (the delay is dependent on
the host's operating system and load).</t>
                </section>
                <section title="Protocol Specification" anchor="protocol">
<t>
There are four different message types.
Echo Request and Echo Reply messages are used for the actual
measurements. An Init message SHOULD be used to
initialise a ping session and negotiate which group to use.
Finally a Server Response message that is mainly used in
response to the Init message. The messages MUST always
be in network byte order. UDP checksums MUST always be used.
</t><t>
The messages share a common format: one octet
specifying the message type, followed by a number of options in
TLV (Type, Length and Value) format. This makes the protocol
easily extendible.
</t><t>
Message types in the range 0-253 are reserved and available for
allocation in an IANA Registry. Message types 254 and 255
are not registered and are freely available for experimental use.
See <xref target="iana"/>.
</t><t>
The Init message generally contains some
prefix options asking the server for a group from one of the
specified prefixes. The server responds with a Server Response
message that contains the group address to use, or possibly
prefix options describing what multicast groups the server may
be able to provide.
</t><t>
For an Echo Request the client includes a number of
options, and a server MAY simply echo the contents (only
changing the message type) without inspecting the options if
it does not support any options. This might be true for a
simple Multicast Ping Protocol server, but it severly limits
what information a client can obtain, and hence makes the
protocol less useful. However, the server SHOULD add a TTL option
(allowing the client to determine the number of router hops a reply
has traversed), and
there are other options that a server implementation MAY
support, e.g., the client may ask for certain information or a
specific behaviour from the server.
The Echo Replies (one unicast and one multicast) MUST first
contain the exact options from the request (in the same order), 
and then, immediately following, any options appended by the server.
A server MUST NOT process unknown options, but they MUST still
be included in the Echo Reply. A client MUST ignore any unknown
options.
</t><t>
The size of the protocol messages is generally smaller than the
Path MTU and fragmentation is not a concern. There may however
be cases where the Path MTU is really small, or that a client
sends large requests in order to verify that it can receive
fragmented multicast datagrams. This document does not specify
whether Path MTU Discovery should be performed, etc. A possible
extension could be an option where a client requests Path MTU
Discovery and receives the current Path MTU from the server.
</t>
<t>
This document defines a number of different options. Some options
do not require processing by servers and are simply returned unmodified
in the reply. There are, however, other client options that the server
may care about, as well as server options that may be requested by a
client.
Unless otherwise specified, an option MUST NOT be used multiple
times in the same message.

<t>Version, type 0

Length MUST be 1. This option MUST always be
included in all messages, and for the current specified protocol this
value MUST be set to 2 (in decimal). 
Note that there are implementations of older revisions of this
protocol that only partly
follow this specification. They can be regarded as version 1 and do
not use this option. If a server receives a message with a version
other than 2 (or missing), the server SHOULD (unless it supports the
particular version) send a Server Response message back with version set to
2. This tells the client that the server expects version 2 messages.
Client ID and Sequence Number options MUST be echoed if
present, so that a client can be certain it is a response to one of
its messages, and exactly which message. The server SHOULD NOT include
any other options. A client receiving
a response with a version other than 2 MUST stop sending requests to the server
(unless it supports the particular version).
</t></list></t>
<t>Client ID, type 1
<list style="empty"><t>
Length MUST be non-zero.
A client SHOULD always include this option in all messages
(both Init and Echo Request). The client may use any value it likes to
detect whether a reply is a reply to its Init/Echo Request or not.
A server should treat this as opaque data, and MUST echo this option
back in the reply if present (both Server Response and Echo Reply).
The value might be a pseudo random byte string that is likely to be
unique, possibly combined with the client IP address. Predictability
is not a big concern here.
This is used by the client to ensure that server messages are in response
to its requests. In some cases a client may receive multicast responses to
queries from other clients.
It is left to the client implementer how to use this option.
</t></list></t>
<t>Sequence Number, type 2
<list style="empty"><t>
Length MUST be 4.
A client MUST always include this in Echo Request messages and MUST NOT
include it in Init messages. A server replying to an Echo Request message
MUST copy it into the Echo Reply (or Server Response message on error).
The sequence number is a 32-bit integer. Values typically
start at 1 and increase by one for each Echo Request in a sequence.
</t></list></t>
<t>Client Timestamp, type 3
<list style="empty"><t>
Length MUST be 8. A client SHOULD
include this in Echo Request messages and MUST NOT include it in Init
messages. A server replying to an Echo Request message MUST copy it into
the Echo Reply.
The timestamp specifies the time when the Echo Request message is sent.
The first 4 bytes specify the number of seconds since the Epoch
(0000 UTC Jan 1, 1970). The next 4 bytes specify the number
of microseconds since the second specified in the first 4 bytes. This
option would typically be used by a client to compute round trip times.
</t><t>
Note that while this protocol uses the above 32 bit format, it would
have been better to use another format, such as the one defined in NTPv4
<xref target="RFC5905"/>. This should be considered for future extensions
of the protocol.

<t>Multicast Group, type 4
<list style="empty"><t>
Length MUST be greater than 2. It MAY
be used in Server Response messages to tell the client what group
to use in subsequent Echo Request messages. It MUST be used in Echo
Request messages to tell the server what group address to respond to

message). It MUST be used in Echo Reply messages (copied from the Echo
Request message). It MUST NOT be used in Init messages.

The address family is a value 0-65535 as assigned by IANA for Internet

<t>Option Request Option, type 5

Length MUST be greater than
1. This option MAY be used in client messages (Init and Echo Request
messages). A server MUST NOT send this option, except that if
it is present in an Echo Request message, the server MUST echo it
in replies (Echo Reply message) to the Echo Request.
This option contains a list of option types for options that
the client is requesting from the server. Support for this option
is OPTIONAL for both clients and servers. The length of this option
will be a non-zero even number, since it contains one or more option
types that are two octets each. The format of the option value is as

This option might be used by the client to ask the server to include
options like Timestamp or Server Information. A client MAY request
Server Information in Init messages; it MUST NOT request it in
other messages. A client MAY request a timestamp in Echo Request
messages; it MUST NOT request it in other messages.
Subject to enforcing the above restrictions, a server supporting this
option SHOULD include the requested options in responses (Echo Reply
messages) to the Echo Request containing the Option Request Option. The
server may, according to implementation or local configuration, not
necessarily include all the requested options, or possibly none. Any
options included are appended to the echoed options, similar to
other options included by the server.
</t></list></t>
<t>Server Information, type 6
<list style="empty"><t>
Length MUST be non-zero. It MAY
be used in Server Response messages and MUST NOT be used in other
messages. Support for this
option is OPTIONAL. A server supporting this option SHOULD add
it in Server Response messages if and only if requested by the
client. The value is a UTF-8 <xref target="RFC3629"/> string
that might contain vendor
and version information for the server implementation. It may
also contain information on which options the server supports.
An interactive client MAY support this option, and SHOULD then
allow a user to request this string and display it. Although
support for this is OPTIONAL, we say that a server SHOULD
return it if requested, since this may be helpful to a user
running the client. It is however purely informational, it is
not needed for the protocol to function.
</t></list></t>
<t>Deprecated, type 7
<list style="empty"><t>
This option code value was used by implementations of version 1
of this protocol, and is not used in this version. Servers MUST
treat it as an unknown option (not process it if received, but
if received in an Echo Request message, it MUST be echoed in
the Echo Reply message). 
</t></list></t>
<t>Deprecated, type 8
<list style="empty"><t>
This option code value was used by implementations of version 1
of this protocol, and is not used in this version. Servers MUST
treat it as an unknown option (not process it if received, but
if received in an Echo Request message, it MUST be echoed in
the Echo Reply message). 
</t></list></t>
<t>TTL, type 9
<list style="empty"><t>
Length MUST be 1. This option contains a single
octet specifying the TTL of an Echo Reply message. Every time a server
sends a unicast or multicast Echo Reply message, it SHOULD include
this option specifying the TTL. This is used by clients to
determine the number of hops the messages have traversed. It
MUST NOT be used in other messages. A server SHOULD specify this
option if it knows what the TTL of the Echo Reply will be. In general
the server can specify a specific TTL to the host stack. Note
that the TTL is not necessarily the same for unicast and
multicast. Also note that this option SHOULD be included even when not
requested by the client. The protocol will work even if this option is
not included, but it limits what information a client can obtain.
</t><t>
If the server did not include this TTL option, there is no reliable
way for the client to know the initial TTL of the Echo Reply, and therefore
the client SHOULD NOT attempt to calculate the number of hops the message
has traversed.
</t></list></t>
<t>Multicast Prefix, type 10
<list style="empty"><t>
Length MUST be greater than 2. It MAY
be used in Init messages to request a group within the prefix(es) and
it MAY be used in Server Response messages to tell the client what
prefix(es) it may try to obtain a group from. It MUST NOT be used
in Echo Request/Reply messages. Note that this option MAY be included
multiple times to specify multiple prefixes.

The address family is a value 0-65535 as assigned by IANA for Internet
address families <xref target="addrfamily"/>.
This is followed by a prefix length (4-32 for IPv4, 8-128 for IPv6,
or 0 for the special "wildcard" use discussed below),
and finally a group address. For any family, prefix length 0 means
that any multicast address from that family is acceptable. This is
what we call "wildcard."
The group
address need only contain enough octets to cover the prefix length
bits (i.e., the group address would have to be 3 octets long if the
prefix length is 17-24, and there need be no group address for the
wildcard with prefix length 0).  Any bits past the prefix length MUST
be ignored.  For IPv4, the option value length will be 4-7, while for
IPv6, it will be 4-19, and for the wildcard, it will be 3.
</t></list></t>
<t>Session ID, type 11
<list style="empty"><t>
Length MUST be 4 or larger. A server SHOULD
include this in Server Response messages. If a client
receives this option in a message, the client MUST echo the
Session ID option in subsequent Echo Request messages, with the exact
same value. The Session ID may help the
server in keeping track of clients and possibly manage per client
state. The value of a new Session ID SHOULD be a pseudo
random byte string that is hard to predict, see <xref target="RFC4086"/>.
The string MUST be at least 4 bytes long.
The Session ID can be used
to mitigate spoofing of the source address of Echo Request messages.
We say that this option SHOULD be used, because it is important for
security reasons. There may however be environments where this is
not required. See the Security Considerations for details.
</t></list></t>
<t>Server Timestamp, type 12
<list style="empty"><t>
Length MUST be 8 bytes. A server
supporting this option, SHOULD include it in Echo Reply messages,
if requested by the client. The timestamp specifies
the time when the Echo Reply message is sent. The first 4
bytes specify the number of seconds since the Epoch
(0000 UTC Jan 1, 1970). The next 4 bytes specify the number
of microseconds since the second specified in the first 4 bytes.
If this option is not included, the protocol will still work, but
it makes it impossible for a client to compute one way delay.

  		        <section title="Message Types and Options" anchor="msgs">
<t>There are four message types defined. We will now describe
each of the message types and which options they may contain.
</t>
<t>
<list style="empty">
<t>Init, type 73
<list style="empty"><t>
This message is sent by a client to request
information from a server. It is mainly used for requesting a
group address, but it may also be used to check which group
prefixes the server may provide groups from, or other server
information. It MUST include a Version option, and SHOULD include
a Client ID. It MAY include Option Request and Multicast
Prefix Options. This message is a request for a group address
if and only if it contains Multicast Prefix options. If
multiple Prefix options are included, they should be in prioritised
order. I.e., the server will consider the prefixes in the order
they are specified, and if it finds a group for a prefix,
it will only return that one group, not considering the remaining
prefixes.
</t></list></t>
<t>Server Response, type 83
<list style="empty"><t>
This message is sent by a
server, either as a response to an Init, or in response to
an Echo Request. When responding to Init, it may provide the client
with a multicast group (if requested by the client), or it may
provide other server information. In response to an Echo Request, the
message tells the client to stop sending Echo Requests. The Version
option MUST always be included. Client ID and Sequence Number options
are echoed if present in the client message. When providing
a group to the client, it includes a Multicast Group option.
It SHOULD include Server Information and Prefix options if
requested. It SHOULD also include the Session ID option.
</t></list></t>
<t>Echo Request, type 81
<list style="empty"><t>
This message is sent by a client, asking the server to send unicast
and multicast Echo Replies. It MUST include
Version, Sequence Number and Multicast Group options.
If a Session ID was received in a Server Response message,
then the Session ID MUST be included.
It SHOULD include Client ID and Client Timestamp options.
It MAY include an Option Request option.
</t></list></t>
<t>Echo Reply, type 65
<list style="empty"><t>
This message is sent by a server in response
to an Echo Request message. This message is always sent in pairs,
one as unicast and one as multicast. The contents of the messages
are mostly the same. The server always echoes all of the options
(but never the Session ID) from the Echo Request. Any options in the
Echo Request that are unsupported by the server, are also to be
echoed. The two Echo Reply messages SHOULD both always contain a
TTL option (not necessarily equal). Both Echo Reply messages SHOULD
also when requested contain Server Timestamps (not necessarily equal).
</t></list></t>
</list></t>
<t>The below matrix summarises what options can go in what messages.

NOT means that the option MUST NOT be included. ECHO for a server
means that if the option is specified by the client, then the server
MUST echo the option in the response, with the exact same option
value.
ECHO for a client only applies to the Session ID option. If it is
present in the Server Response, then it MUST be present with the
exact same option value in the following Echo Requests.
RQ means that the server SHOULD include the option in the response,
when requested by the client using the Option Request option.

  		        <section title="Rate Limiting" anchor="rate">
<t>Clients MUST by default send at most Default-Client-Request-Rate
<xref target="mrv"/>
Echo Requests per second. Note that the value can be less than 1.
Servers MUST by default perform rate limiting, to guard against this
protocol being used for DoS attacks. A server MUST by default limit
the number of clients that can be served at the same time, and a server
MUST also by default for a given client, respond to on average at most
Default-Server-Rate-Limit (see <xref target="mrv"/>) Echo Request messages
per second. Note that the value can be less than 1.
Server implementations should provide configuration options allowing
certain clients to perform more rapid Echo Requests. If higher rates are
allowed for specific client IP addresses, then Init messages and the
Session ID option MUST be used to help mitigate spoofing.
</t><t>
Implementers of applications/tools using this protocol SHOULD consider
the <xref target="RFC5405">UDP guidelines</xref>,
in particular if clients are to send, or servers are to accept,
Echo Requests at rates exceeding the defaults given in this document.

<t>There are two variables that control message rates. They are defined
as follows.

This variable defines the default client echo request rate, specifying
the number of requests per second. Note that the value may be less than
one. E.g., a value of 0.1 means one packet per 10 seconds. The value 1
is RECOMMENDED, but the value might be too small or large depending on
the type of network the client is deployed in. The value 1 is chosen
because it should be safe in most deployments, and it is similar to
what is typically used for the common tool "ping" for ICMP Echo Requests.
</t></list>
</t>
<t>Default-Server-Rate-Limit
<list style="empty"><t>
This variable defines the default per client rate limit that a server uses
for responding to Echo Request messages. The average rate of replies, MUST
NOT exceed Default-Server-Rate-Limit per second. Note that the value may be
less than one. E.g., a value of 0.1 means an average of one packet per 10
seconds. The value 1 is RECOMMENDED, but the value might be too small or
large depending on the type of network the client is deployed in. The value
1 is chosen because it should be safe in most deployments. This value SHOULD
be high enough to accept the value chosen for the Default-Client-Request-Rate.

		</section>
		<section title="Client Behaviour" anchor="clbeh">
<t>We will consider how a typical interactive client using the
above protocol would behave.
</t><t>
A client only requires a user to
specify the unicast address of the server. It can then send an Init
message with a prefix option containing the desired address family
and zero prefix length (wildcard entry). The server can then
decide which group, from the specified family, it should return.
A client may also allow the user to specify
group address(es) or prefix(es) (for IPv6, the user may only be
required to specify a scope or an RP address, from which the client
can construct the desired prefix, possibly embedded-RP). From this
the client can specify one or more prefix options in an Init message
to tell the server which address it would prefer. If the user
specifies a group address, that can be encoded as a prefix of
maximal length (e.g., 32 for IPv4). The prefix options are in
prioritised order, i.e., the client should put the most preferred
prefix first.
</t><t>
If the client receives a Server Response message containing a group
address it can start sending Echo Request messages, see the next
paragraph. If there is no group address option, the client would
typically exit with an error message. The server may have included some
prefix options in the Server Response. The client may use this to
provide the user some feedback on what prefixes or scopes are
available.
</t><t>
Assuming the client got a group address in a Server Response, it
can start the multicast pings, after letting the user know
which group is being used. Normally, a client should send at most
Default-Client-Request-Rate <xref target="mrv"/>
Echo Requests per second.
</t><t>
When sending the Echo Requests, the client
must always include the group option. If the Server Response
contained a Session ID, then it must also include
that, with the exact same value, in the Echo Requests.
If a client receives a Server
Response message in response to an Echo Request (that is, a
Server Response message containing a sequence number), this means
there is an error and it should stop sending Echo Requests.
This could happen after server restart.
</t><t>
The client may allow the user to request server
information. If the user requests server information, the client
can send an Init message with no prefix options, but with an
Option Request Option, requesting the server to return a Server
Information option. The server will return server information if
supported, and it may also return a list of prefixes it supports.
It will however not return a group address. The client may also
try to obtain only a list of prefixes by sending an Init message
with no prefixes and not requesting any specific options.
</t><t>
Although not recommended, a client may pick a multicast group and
send Echo Request
messages without first going through the Init - Server Response
negotiation. If this is supported by the server and the server
is okay with the group used, the server can then send Echo Reply
messages as usual. If the server is not okay, it will send a
Server Response telling the client to stop.
</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Server Behaviour">
<t>We will consider how a typical server using the above protocol
would behave, first looking at how to respond to Init messages.
</t><t>
If the Init message contains prefix options, the server should
look at them in order and see if it can assign a multicast
address from the given prefix. The server would be configured
with, possibly have a default, a set of groups it can offer.
It may have a large pool and pick a group at random, or
possibly choosing a group based on hashing of the client's IP
address or identifier, or simply use a fixed group. A server could
possibly decide whether to include site scoped group ranges
based on the client's IP address. It is left to the server to
decide whether it should allow the same address to
be used simultaneously by multiple clients.
</t><t>
If the server finds
a suitable group address, it returns this in a group option in a
Server Response message. The server should additionally include a
Session ID. This may help the server if it is to keep some state,
for instance to make sure the client uses the group it got
assigned. A good Session ID would be a pseudo random byte string
that is hard to predict, see <xref target="RFC4086"/>.
If the server cannot find a suitable
group address, or if there were no prefixes in the Init message,
it may send a Server Response message containing prefix options
listing what prefixes may be available to the client. Finally,
if the Init message requests the Server Information option, the
server should include that.
</t><t>
When the server receives an Echo Request message, it must first
check that the group address and Session ID (if provided) are
valid. If the server is satisfied, it will send a unicast Echo
Reply message back to the client, and also a multicast Echo
Reply message to the group address. The Echo Reply messages
contain the exact options (but no Session ID) and in the same
order, as in the Echo Request, and after
that the server adds a TTL option and additional options if
needed. For example, it may add a timestamp
if requested by the client. If the server is not happy with the
Echo Request (such as bad group address or Session ID, request
is too large), it may send a Server Response
message asking the client to stop. This Server Response must
echo the sequence number from the Echo Request. This Server Response
may contain group prefixes from which a client can
try to request a group address.
The unicast and multicast Echo Reply messages have
identical UDP payload apart from possibly TTL and timestamp
option values.
</t><t>
Note that the server may receive Echo Request messages with no
prior Init message. This may happen when the server restarts
or if a client sends an Echo Request with no prior Init message.
The server may go ahead and respond if it is okay with the group
and Session ID (if included) used. If it is not okay, the server
sends back a Server Response.
</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Recommendations for Implementers" anchor="imprec">
<t>
The protocol as specified is fairly flexible and leaves a lot of
freedom for implementers. In this section we present some
recommendations.
</t>
<t>Server administrators should be able to configure one or
multiple group prefixes in a server implementation. When
deploying servers on the Internet and in other environments,
the server administrator should be able to restrict the server
to respond to only a few multicast groups which should not be
currently used by multicast applications. A server implementation
should also provide flexibility for an administrator to apply
various policies to provide one or multiple group prefixes to
specific clients, e.g., site scoped addresses for clients that
are inside the site.
</t><t>
As specified in <xref target="rate"/>, a server must by default
for a given client, respond to at most an average rate of
Default-Server-Rate-Limit Echo Request messages per
second. A leaky bucket algorithm is suggested, where the rate
can be higher for a few seconds, but the average rate should
by default be limited to Default-Server-Rate-Limit messages per
per client per second.
Server implementations should provide administrative
control of which client IP addresses to serve, and may also allow
certain clients to perform more rapid Echo Requests.
</t><t>
If a server uses different policies for different IP addresses,
it should require clients to send Init messages and return an
unpredictable Session ID to help mitigate spoofing. This is an
absolute requirement if exceeding the default rate limit.
See specification in <xref target="rate"/>.

		<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="seccons">
<t>There are some security issues to consider. One is that a host
may send an Echo Request with an IP source address of another host,
and make an arbitrary multicast ping server on the Internet send
packets to this other host. This behaviour is fairly harmless.
The worst case is if the host receiving the unicast Echo
Replies also happens to be joined to the multicast group used.
This is less of a problem for SSM where also the source address
of the server must match the address joined.
In this case, there would be an amplification effect where the host
receives twice as many replies as there are requests sent. See
below for how spoofing can be mitigated.
</t><t>
For ASM (Any-Source Multicast) a host could also make a multicast
ping server send multicast packets to a group that is used for
something else, possibly disturbing other uses of that group.
However, server implementations should allow administrators to restrict
which groups a server responds to. The administrator should then
try to configure a set of groups that are not used for other
purposes. Another concern is bandwidth. To limit the bandwidth used,
a server MUST by default limit the number of clients that can be served
at the same time, and a server MUST also by default perform per client
rate limiting.
</t><t>
In order to help mitigate spoofing, a server SHOULD require the
client to send an Init message, and return an unpredictable
Session ID in the response. The ID should be associated with the
IP address and have a limited lifetime. The server SHOULD then
only respond to Echo Request messages that have a valid Session ID
associated with the source IP address of the Echo Request. Note
however that a server is replying with a Server Response message
if the Session ID is invalid. This is used to tell the client that
something is wrong and that is should stop sending requests, and
start over if necessary. This means however, that someone may
spoof a client request, and have the server send a message back
to the client address. One solution here would be for the server
to have a very low rate limit for the Server Responses.
</t><t>
Note that the use of a Session ID only to some degree helps
mitigate spoofing. An attacker that is on the path between
a client and a server, may eavesdrop the traffic, learn a
valid Session ID, and generate Echo Requests using this ID.
The server will respond as long as the Session ID remains valid.
</t><t>
This protocol may be used to establish a covert channel between
a multicast ping client and other hosts listening to a multicast
group. A client can for instance send an Echo Request containing
an undefined option with arbitrary data. The server would echo
this back in an Echo Reply that may reach other hosts listening
to that group. One solution to this which should be considered
for future protocol versions, is to reply with a hash of the data,
rather than simply a copy of the same data.

Internet-Draft          IPv4 Multicast Guidelines          November 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) (www.iana.org) is
   charged with allocating parameter values for fields in protocols
   which have been designed, created or are maintained by the Internet
   Engineering Task Force (IETF).  RFC 2780 [RFC2780] provides the IANA
   guidance in the assignment of parameters for fields in newly
   developed protocols.  This memo expands on section 4.4.2 of RFC 2780
   and attempts to codify existing IANA practice used in the assignment
   IPv4 multicast addresses.

   This document is a revision of RFC 3171 [RFC3171], which it
   obsoletes.  It also obsoletes RFC 3138 [RFC3138] and updates
   [RFC2780].

   The terms "Specification Required", "Expert Review", "IESG Approval",
   "IETF Review", and "Standards Action", are used in this memo to refer
   to the processes described in [RFC5226].

   In general, due to the relatively small size of the IPv4 multicast
   address space, further assignment of IPv4 multicast address space is
   recommended only in limited circumstances.  Specifically, the IANA
   should only assign addresses in those cases where:
      - the dynamic selection Session Description Protocol/Session
      Announcement Protocol (SDP/SAP);
      - GLOP (not an acronym);
      - Source Specific Multicast (SSM); or
      - Administratively Scoped address spaces
   cannot be used.  The guidelines described below are reflected in
   [IANA-protocols].  Network operators should also be aware of the
   availability of IPv6 multicast addresses and consider using them
   where feasible.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   The word "allocation" designates a block of addresses managed by a
   registry for the purpose of making assignments and allocations.  The
   word "assignment" designates a block of addresses, or a single
   address, registered to an end-user for use on a specific network, or
   set of networks.

3.  Definition of Current Assignment Practice

   Unlike IPv4 unicast address assignment, where blocks of addresses are
   delegated to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), IPv4 multicast
   addresses are assigned directly by the IANA.  Current registration
   groups appear as follows [IANA]:


Address Range                 Size       Designation
-------------                 ----       -----------


224.0.0.0 - 224.0.0.255       (/24)      Local Network Control Block

224.0.1.0 - 224.0.1.255       (/24)      Internetwork Control Block

224.0.2.0 - 224.0.255.255     (65024)    AD-HOC Block I

224.1.0.0 - 224.1.255.255     (/16)      RESERVED

224.2.0.0 - 224.2.255.255     (/16)      SDP/SAP Block

224.3.0.0 - 224.4.255.255     (2 /16s)   AD-HOC Block II

224.5.0.0 - 224.255.255.255   (251 /16s) RESERVED

225.0.0.0 - 231.255.255.255   (7 /8s)    RESERVED

232.0.0.0 - 232.255.255.255   (/8)       Source Specific Multicast Block

233.0.0.0 - 233.251.255.255   (16515072) GLOP Block

233.252.0.0 - 233.255.255.255 (/14)      AD-HOC Block III

234.0.0.0 - 238.255.255.255   (5 /8s)    RESERVED

239.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255   (/8)       Administratively Scoped Block


   The IANA generally assigns addresses from the Local Network Control,
   Internetwork Control and AD-HOC blocks.  Assignment guidelines for
   each of these blocks, as well as for the Source Specific Multicast,
   GLOP and Administratively Scoped Blocks, are described below.


4.  Local Network Control Block (224.0.0/24)

   Addresses in the Local Network Control block are used for protocol

Internet-Draft          IPv4 Multicast Guidelines          November 2009


   control traffic that is not forwarded off link.  Examples of this
   type of use include OSPFIGP All Routers (224.0.0.5) [RFC2328].

4.1.  Assignment Guidelines

   Pursuant to section 4.4.2 of [RFC2780], assignments from the Local
   Network Control block follow an Expert Review, IESG Approval or
   Standards Action process.  See IANA [IANA] for the current set of
   assignments.


5.  Internetwork Control Block (224.0.1/24)

   Addresses in the Internetwork Control block are used for protocol
   control traffic that MAY be forwarded through the Internet.  Examples
   include 224.0.1.1 (NTP [RFC4330]) and 224.0.1.68 (mdhcpdiscover
   [RFC2730]).

5.1.  Assignment Guidelines

   Pursuant to section 4.4.2 of [RFC2780], assignments from the
   Internetwork Control block follow an Expert Review, IESG Approval or
   Standards Action process.  See IANA [IANA] for the current set of
   assignments.


6.  AD-HOC blocks (including 224.0.2.0 - 224.0.255.255, 224.3.0.0 -
    224.4.255.255 and 233.252.0.0 - 233.255.255.255)

   Addresses in the AD-HOC blocks were traditionally used for
   assignments for those applications that don't fit in either the Local
   or Internetwork Control blocks.  These addresses MAY be globally
   routed and are typically used by applications that require small
   blocks of addressing (e.g., less than a /24 ).  Future assignments of
   blocks of addresses that do not fit in the Local or Internetwork
   block will be made in the Ad-Hoc Block III.

6.1.  Assignment Guidelines

   In general, the IANA SHOULD NOT assign addressing in the AD-HOC
   Blocks.  However, the IANA MAY under special circumstances, assign
   addresses from these blocks.  Pursuant to section 4.4.2 of [RFC2780],
   assignments from the AD-HOC blocks follow an Expert Review, IESG
   Approval or Standards Action process.  See [IANA] for the current set
   of assignments.

Internet-Draft          IPv4 Multicast Guidelines          November 2009


7.  SDP/SAP Block (224.2/16)

   Addresses in the SDP/SAP block are used by applications that receive
   addresses through the Session Announcement Protocol [RFC2974] for use
   via applications like the session directory tool (such as SDR [SDR]).

7.1.  Assignment Guidelines

   Since addresses in the SDP/SAP block are chosen randomly from the
   range of addresses not already in use [RFC2974], no IANA assignment
   policy is required.  Note that while no additional IANA assignment is
   required, addresses in the SDP/SAP block are explicitly for use by
   SDP/SAP and MUST NOT be used for other purposes.


8.  Source Specific Multicast Block (232/8)

   SSM [RFC4607] is an extension of IP Multicast in which traffic is
   forwarded to receivers from only those multicast sources for which
   the receivers have explicitly expressed interest, and is primarily
   targeted at one-to-many (broadcast) applications.  Note that this
   block was initially assigned to the Versatile Message Transaction
   Protocol (VMTP) transient groups [IANA].

8.1.  Assignment Guidelines

   Because the SSM model essentially makes the entire multicast address
   space local to the host, no IANA assignment policy is required.
   Note, however, that while no additional IANA assignment is required,
   addresses in the SSM block are explicitly for use by SSM and MUST NOT
   be used for other purposes.


9.  GLOP Block (233/8)

   Addresses in the GLOP block are globally scoped statically assigned
   addresses.  The assignment is made, for a domain with 16 bit
   Autonomous System Number (ASN), by mapping a domain's autonomous
   system number, expressed in octets as X.Y, into the middle two octets
   of the GLOP block, yielding an assignment of 233.X.Y.0/24.  The
   mapping and assignment is defined in [RFC3180].  Domains with a 32
   bit ASN MAY apply for space in AD-HOC Block III, or consider using
   IPv6 multicast addresses.

9.1.  Assignment Guidelines

   Because addresses in the GLOP block are algorithmically pre-assigned,
   no IANA assignment policy is required.

Internet-Draft          IPv4 Multicast Guidelines          November 2009


9.2.  AD-HOC Block III

   [RFC3138] delegated to the RIRs the assignment of the GLOP sub-block
   (233.252.0.0 - 233.255.255.255) mapped by the private Auronomous
   System (AS) space (64512-65534) and the IANA reserved ASN 65535
   [RFC1930].  This space was known as Extended GLOP (EGLOP).  RFC 3138
   should not have asked the RIRs to develop policies for the EGLOP
   space because [RFC2860] reserves that to the IETF.  It is important
   to make this space available for use by network operators and it is
   therefore appropriate to obsolete RFC 3138 and classify this address
   range as available for AD-HOC assignment as per the guidelines in
   section 6.

   The first /24 in this range, 233.252.0.0/24, is assigned as "MCAST-
   TEST-NET" for use in documentation and example code. 233.252.0.0/24
   SHOULD be used in conjunction with the [RFC2606] domain names
   example.com or example.net in vendor and protocol documentation.
   Addresses within 233.252.0.0/24 MUST NOT appear on the public
   Internet.


10.  Administratively Scoped Address Block (239/8)

   Addresses in the Administratively Scoped Address block are for local
   use within a domain and are described in [RFC2365].

10.1.  Assignment Guidelines

   Since addresses in this block are local to a domain, no IANA
   assignment policy is required.

10.1.1.  Relative Offsets

   The relative offsets [RFC2365] are used to ensure that a service can
   be located independent of the extent of the enclosing scope (see
   [RFC3180] for details).  Since there are only 256 such offsets, the
   IANA should only assign a relative offset to a protocol that provides
   an infrastructure supporting service.  Examples of such services
   include the Session Announcement Protocol [RFC2974].  Pursuant to
   section 4.4.2 of [RFC2780], assignments of Relative Offsets follow an
   Expert Review, IESG Approval or Standards Action process.  See [IANA]
   for the current set of assignments.


11.  Application Form

   Requests for multicast address assignments can be submitted through
   the application form on the IANA web site at[IANA-registration].  It



Cotton, et al.            Expires May 21, 2010                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          IPv4 Multicast Guidelines          November 2009


   is important to submit sufficient detail to allow the IESG designated
   expert to review the application.  If the details given in the
   request are not clear, or further information is needed, the IESG
   designated expert may request additional information before assigning
   an address.

11.1.  Size of assignments of IPv4 Multicast Addresses

   Occasionally more than one multicast address is required.  In these
   cases multiple addresses are available in AD-HOC Block III.  Where
   there is a requirement for a very large number of addresses, the
   assignment will be staged.  The additional stages will only be made
   after the complete use of the initial assignment(s).

   A separate document describing the policy governing assignment of
   addresses in the AD-HOC blocks I, II and III will be developed and
   published.  The format, location and content has not yet been decided
   and so these will be documented in a future version of this document.


12.  Annual Review

   Given the dynamic nature of IPv4 multicast and its associated
   infrastructure, and the previously undocumented IPv4 multicast
   address assignment guidelines, the IANA should conduct an annual
   review of currently assigned addresses.

12.1.  Address Reclamation

   During the review described above, addresses that were mis-assigned
   should, where possible, be reclaimed or reassigned.

   The IANA should also review assignments in the AD-HOC, "DIS Transient
   Groups", and ST Multicast Groups [RFC1819] blocks and reclaim those
   addresses that are not in use on the global Internet (i.e, those
   applications which can use SSM, GLOP, or Administratively Scoped
   addressing, or are not globally routed).

12.2.  Positive renewal

   It is occasionally appropriate to make temporary assignments that can
   be renewed as necessary.  In cases where this happens the registrant
   needs to positively request an extension to the temporary assignment
   or the addresses assigned.  When the IANA has not received a request
   to renew the registration of a temporary assignment within 30 days of
   the expiry of the assignment it MUST be removed from the multicast
   registry.

Internet-Draft          IPv4 Multicast Guidelines          November 2009


   Addresses returned to the IANA when a temporary assignment ends MUST
   NOT be assigned to anyone other than the last registrant for at least
   one calendar year.


13.  Use of IANA Reserved Addresses

   Applications MUST NOT use addressing in the IANA reserved blocks.


14.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update its IPv4 multicast request and assignment
   procedures to reflect this document.


15.  Security Considerations

   The assignment guidelines described in this document do not alter the
   security properties of either the Any Source or Source Specific
   multicast service models.

        Email on the Internet can be forged in a number of ways.  In
        particular, existing protocols place no restriction on what a sending
        host can use as the "MAIL FROM" of a message or the domain given on
        the SMTP HELO/EHLO commands.  This document describes version 1 of
        the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) protocol, whereby ADministrative
        Management Domains (ADMDs) can explicitly authorize the hosts
        that are allowed to use its domain names, and a receiving host can
        check such authorization.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The current email infrastructure has the property that any host
        injecting mail into the system can use any DNS domain name it wants in
        each of the various identifiers specified by <xref target="RFC5321"/>
        and <xref target="RFC5322"/>.  Although this feature is desirable in
        some circumstances, it is a major obstacle to reducing Unsolicited Bulk
        Email (UBE, aka spam).  Furthermore, many domain owning ADMDs (as
        described in <xref target="RFC5598"/>) are understandably concerned
        about the ease with which other entities can make use of their domain
        names, often with malicious intent.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document defines a protocol by which ADMDs can authorize hosts to
        use their domain names in the "MAIL FROM" or "HELO"
        identities.  Compliant ADMDs publish Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
        records in the DNS specifying which hosts are permitted to use their names,
        and compliant mail receivers use the published SPF records to test the
        authorization of sending Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) using a given
        "HELO" or "MAIL FROM" identity during a mail
        transaction.
      </t>
      <t>
        An additional benefit to mail receivers is that after the use of an
        identity is verified, local policy decisions about the mail can be
        made based on the sender's domain, rather than the host's IP address.
        This is advantageous because reputation of domain names is likely to
        be more accurate than reputation of host IP addresses since domains
        are likely to be more stable over a longer period.  Furthermore,
        if a claimed identity fails verification, local policy can take
        stronger action against such email, such as rejecting it.

              This document is concerned with the portion of a mail message
              commonly called "envelope sender", "return path", "reverse path",
              "bounce address", "5321 FROM", "MAIL FROM", or RFC5321.MailFrom.
              Since these terms are either not well defined or often used
              casually, this document uses "MAIL FROM" for consistency.  This
              means the RFC5321.MailFrom as defined in <xref target="RFC5598"/>.
              Note that other terms that might superficially look like the
              common terms, such as 'reverse-path', are used only as they are
              specified in their defining documents.

              This document also makes use of the HELO/EHLO identity.  The
              "HELO" identity derives from either the SMTP HELO or EHLO
              command (see <xref target="RFC5321"/>).  Since HELO and EHLO can,
              in many cases, be used interchangeably, they are identified
              commonly as "HELO" in this document.  This means
              RFC5321.HELO/.EHLO as defined in <xref target="RFC5598"/>.  These
              commands supply the identity of the SMTP client (sending host) for
              the SMTP session.

      <section title="check_host()" anchor="check_host-def">
        <t>
          <xref target="function"/> introduces an algorithm to evaluate an SPF
          policy against an arriving email transaction.  In an early
          implementation, this algorithm was encoded in a function called
          check_host().  That name is used in this document as symbolic of the
          SPF evaluation algorithm, but of course implementers are not required
          to use this name.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Operational Overview">
      <section title="Publishing Authorization">
        <t>
          An SPF-compliant domain publishes valid SPF records as described in
          <xref target="records"/>.  These records authorize the use of the
          relevant domain names in the "HELO" and "MAIL FROM" identities by
          the MTAs specified therein.
        </t>
        <t>
          SPF results can be used to make both positive (source is authorized)
          and negative (source is not authorized) determinations.  If ADMDs
          choose to publish SPF records and want to support receivers making
          negative authorization determinations, it is necessary for them to
          publish records that end in "-all", or redirect to other records
          that do, otherwise, no definitive determination of authorization can
          be made.  Potential issues and mitigations associated with negative
          determinations are discussed in <xref target="implications"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          ADMDs that wish to declare that no hosts are authorized to use their
          DNS domain names in the HELO or MAIL FROM commands during SMTP
          sessions can publish SPF records that say so for domain names that
          are neither used in the domain part of email addresses nor expected
          to originate mail.
        </t>
        <t>
          When changing SPF records, care has to be taken to ensure that there
          is a transition period so that the old policy remains valid until
          all legitimate email can reasonably expect to have been checked.
          <xref target="RFC5321"/> Section 4.5.4.1 discusses how long a message
          might be in transit.  While offline checks are possible, the closer to
          the original transmission time checks are performed, the more likely
          they are to get an SPF result that matches the sending ADMD intent at
          the time the message was sent.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Checking Authorization" anchor="checkauth">
        <t>
          A mail receiver can perform a set of SPF checks for each mail
          message it receives.  An SPF check tests the authorization of a
          client host to emit mail with a given identity.  Typically, such
          checks are done by a receiving MTA, but can be performed elsewhere
          in the mail processing chain so long as the required information is
          available and reliable.  The "MAIL FROM" and "HELO" identities are
          checked as described in <xref target="mfrom-ident"/> and <xref
          target="helo-ident"/> respectively. 
        </t>
        <t>
          Without explicit approval of the publishing ADMD, checking other
          identities against SPF version 1 records is NOT RECOMMENDED because
          there are cases that are known to give incorrect results.  For
          example, almost all mailing lists rewrite the "MAIL FROM" identity
          (see <xref target="middle-lists"/>), but some do not change any
          other identities in the message.  Documents that define other
          identities will have to define the method for explicit approval.
        </t>
        <t>
          It is possible that mail receivers will use the SPF check as part
          of a larger set of tests on incoming mail.  The results of other
          tests might influence whether or not a particular SPF check is
          performed.  For example, finding the sending host's IP address on a
          local white list might cause all other tests to be skipped and all
          mail from that host to be accepted.
        </t>
        <t>
          When a mail receiver decides to perform an SPF check, it has to use a
          correctly-implemented check_host() function (<xref
          target="function"/>) evaluated with the correct parameters.
          Although the test as a whole is optional, once it has been decided
          to perform a test it has to be performed as specified so that the
          correct semantics are preserved between publisher and receiver.
        </t>
        <t>
          To make the test, the mail receiver MUST evaluate the check_host()
          function with the arguments described in <xref target="arguments"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Although invalid, malformed, or non-existent domains cause SPF
          checks to return "none" because no SPF record can be found, it has
          long been the policy of many MTAs to reject email from such
          domains, especially in the case of invalid "MAIL FROM". Rejecting
          email will prevent one method of circumventing of SPF records.
        </t>
        <t>
          Implementations have to take care to correctly extract the
          &lt;domain&gt; from the data given with the SMTP MAIL FROM command
          as many MTAs will still accept such things as source routes (see
          <xref target="RFC5321"/>, Appendix C), the %-hack (see <xref
          target="RFC1123"/>), and bang paths (see <xref target="RFC1983"/>).
          These archaic features have been maliciously used to bypass
          security systems.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="The &quot;HELO&quot; Identity" anchor="helo-ident">
        <t>
          It is RECOMMENDED that SPF verifiers not only check the "MAIL FROM"
          identity, but also separately check the "HELO" identity by
          applying the check_host() function (<xref target="function"/>) to the
          "HELO" identity as the &lt;sender&gt;.  Checking
          "HELO" promotes consistency of results and can reduce DNS
          resource usage.  If a conclusive determination about the message can
          be made based on a check of "HELO", then the use of DNS resources to
          process the typically more complex "MAIL FROM" can be avoided.
          Additionally, since SPF records published for "HELO" identities
          refer to a single host, when available, they are a very reliable
          source of host authorization status.  Checking "HELO" before "MAIL
          FROM" is the RECOMMENDED sequence if both are checked.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that requirements for the domain presented in the EHLO or HELO
          command are not always clear to the sending party, and SPF verifiers
          have to be prepared for the identity to be an IP address literal (see
          <xref target="RFC5321"/> section 4.1.3), or simply be malformed.
          This SPF check can only be performed when the "HELO" string is a
          valid, multi-label domain name.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="The &quot;MAIL FROM&quot; Identity" anchor="mfrom-ident">
        <t>
          SPF verifiers MUST check the "MAIL FROM" identity if a "HELO" check
          has either not been performed or has not reached a definitive policy
          result by applying the check_host() function to the "MAIL FROM"
          identity as the &lt;sender&gt;.
        </t>
        <t>
          <xref target="RFC5321"/> allows the reverse-path to be null (see
          Section 4.5.5 in <xref target="RFC5321"/>).  In this case, there is no
          explicit sender mailbox, and such a message can be assumed to be a
          notification message from the mail system itself.  When the
          reverse-path is null, this document defines the "MAIL FROM"
          identity to be the mailbox composed of the local-part "postmaster"
          and the "HELO" identity (which might or might not have been
          checked separately before).
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Location of Checks" anchor="op-location">
        <t>
          The authorization check SHOULD be performed during the processing of
          the SMTP transaction that receives the mail.  This reduces the
          complexity of determining the correct IP address to use as an input
          to check_host() and allows errors to be returned directly to the
          sending MTA by way of SMTP replies.  Appendix C of <xref
          target="RFC5451"/> provides a more thorough discussion of this
          topic.
        </t>
        <t>
          Performing the authorization check other than using the MAIL FROM
          and client address at the time of the MAIL command during the SMTP
          transaction can cause problems, such as the following: (1) It might be
          difficult to accurately extract the required information from
          potentially deceptive headers; (2) legitimate email might fail because
          the sender's policy had since changed.
        </t>
        <t>
          Generating non-delivery notifications to forged identities that have
          failed the authorization check often constitutes backscatter, i.e.,
          inactionable, nuisance rejection notices.  Operators are strongly
          advised to avoid such practices. Section 2 of <xref

    <section title="SPF Records" anchor="records">
      <t>
        An SPF record is a DNS record that declares which hosts are, and are
        not, authorized to use a domain name for the "HELO" and "MAIL FROM"
        identities. Loosely, the record partitions hosts into permitted and
        not-permitted sets (though some hosts might fall into neither category).
      </t>
      <t>
        The SPF record is expressed as a single string of text found in the
        RDATA of a single DNS TXT resource record; multiple SPF records are
        not permitted for the same owner name.  The record format and the
        process for selecting records is described below in <xref
        target="function"/>.  An example record is the following:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list>
          <t>v=spf1 +mx a:colo.example.com/28 -all</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        This record has a version of "spf1" and three directives: "+mx",
        "a:colo.example.com/28" (the + is implied), and "-all".
      </t>
        <t>
          Each SPF record is placed in the DNS tree at the owner name it
          pertains to, not a subdomain under it, such as is done with SRV
          records <xref target="RFC2782"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          The example in this section might be published via these
          lines in a domain zone file:
        </t>
        <figure>
          <artwork>
   example.com.          TXT "v=spf1 +mx a:colo.example.com/28 -all"
   smtp-out.example.com. TXT "v=spf1 a -all"
          </artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          Since TXT records have multiple uses, beware of other TXT records
          published there for other purposes.  They might cause problems with
          size limits (see <xref target="rsize"/>) and care has to be taken to
          ensure only SPF records are used for SPF processing.
        </t>
        <t>
          ADMDs publishing SPF records ought to keep the amount of DNS
          information needed to evaluate a record to a minimum.  <xref
          target="eval-limits"/> and <xref target="sending-resources"/>
          provide some suggestions about "include" mechanisms and chained
          "redirect" modifiers.

            SPF records MUST be published as a DNS TXT (type 16) Resource Record

            record is encoded as <xref target="US-ASCII"/>.  Use of alternative
            DNS RR types was supported in SPF's experimental phase, but has been

        <section title="Multiple Strings in a Single DNS record">
          <t>
            As defined in <xref target="RFC1035"/> sections 3.3 and 3.3.14, a
            single text DNS record can be composed of more than one string. If a
            published record contains multiple character-strings, then the
            record MUST be treated as if those strings are concatenated together
            without adding spaces. For example:
          </t>
          <t>
            <list style="empty">
              <t>IN TXT "v=spf1 .... first" "second string..."</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>is equivalent to:</t>
          <t>
            <list style="empty">
              <t>IN TXT "v=spf1 .... firstsecond string..."</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            TXT records containing multiple strings are useful in
            constructing records that would exceed the 255-octet maximum
            length of a character-string within a single TXT record.

        <section title="Record Size" anchor="rsize">
          <t>
            The published SPF record for a given domain name SHOULD remain
            small enough that the results of a query for it will fit within
            512 octets.  This UDP limit is defined in <xref target="RFC1035"/>
            section 2.3.4, although it was raised by <xref target="RFC2671"/>.
            Staying below 512 octets ought to prevent older DNS
            implementations from failing over to TCP,and will work with UDP in
            the absence of EDNS0 <xref target="RFC6891"/> support.  Since the
            answer size is dependent on many things outside the scope of this
            document, it is only possible to give this guideline: If the
            combined length of the DNS name and the text of all the records of
            a given type is under 450 octets, then DNS answers ought to fit in
            UDP packets.  Records that are too long to fit in a single UDP
            packet could be silently ignored by SPF verifiers due to firewall
            and other issues that interfere with the operation of DNS over TCP
            or using ENDS0.
          </t>
          <t>
            Note that when computing the sizes for replies to queries of the TXT
            format, one has to take into account any other TXT records published
            at the domain name.  Similarly, the sizes for replies to all queries
            related to SPF have to be evaluated to fit in a single 512 octet
            UDP packet.

        <section title="Wildcard Records">
          <t>
            Use of wildcard records for publishing is discouraged and care
            has to be taken if they are used. If a zone includes
            wildcard MX records, it might want to publish wildcard
            declarations, subject to the same requirements and problems. In
            particular, the declaration MUST be repeated for any host that
            has any RR records at all, and for subdomains thereof. Consider the
            example in <xref target="RFC1034"/>, Section 4.3.3.  Based on that,
            we can do the following:

        semantically equivalent to this description.
      </t>
      <t>
        The check_host() function fetches SPF records, parses them, and
        evaluates them to determine whether a particular host is or is not
        permitted to send mail with a given identity. Receiving ADMDs that
        perform this check MUST correctly evaluate the check_host() function
        as described here.

      <t>
        Implementations MAY use a different algorithm than the canonical
        algorithm defined here, so long as the results are the same in all
        cases.

          EHLO/HELO domain is used, with its associated problems (see <xref

            not count against this limit.  If this number is exceeded during a
            check, a "permerror" MUST be returned.  The "exp" modifier does not
            count against this limit because the DNS lookup to fetch the
            explanation string occurs after the SPF record evaluation has been
            completed.
          </t>
          <t>
            When evaluating the "mx" mechanism, the number of "MX" resource
            records queried is included in the overall limit of 10 mechanisms/
            modifiers that cause DNS lookups described above.  The evaluation of each
            "MX" record MUST NOT result in querying more than 10 address
            records, either "A" or "AAAA" resource records.  If this limit is
            exceeded, the "mx" mechanism MUST produce a "permerror" result.
          </t>
          <t>
            When evaluating the "ptr" mechanism or the %{p} macro, the number of
            "PTR" resource records queried is included in the overall limit of
            10 mechanisms/modifiers that cause DNS lookups described above.
            The evaluation of each "PTR" record MUST NOT result in querying more
            than 10 address records, either "A" or "AAAA" resource records.  If
            this limit is exceeded, all records other than the first 10 MUST be
            ignored.
          </t>
          <t>
            The reason for the disparity is that the set of and contents of the
            MX record are under control of the publishing ADMD, while the set of
            and contents of PTR records are under control of the owner of the IP
            address actually making the connection.
          </t>
          <t>
            These limits are per mechanism or macro in the record, and are in
            addition to the lookup limits specified above.
          </t>
          <t>
            MTAs or other processors SHOULD impose a limit on the maximum
            amount of elapsed time to evaluate check_host(). Such a limit
            SHOULD allow at least 20 seconds. If such a limit is exceeded, the
            result of authorization SHOULD be "temperror".
          </t>
          <t>
            As described at the end of <xref target="security-processing"/>,
            there may be cases where it is useful to limit the number of "terms"
            for which DNS queries return either a positive answer (RCODE 0)
            with an answer count of 0, or a no such record (RCODE 3) answer.
            These are sometimes collectively referred to as "void lookups".  SPF
            implementations SHOULD limit "void lookups" to two.  An
            implementation MAY choose to make such a limit configurable.  In
            this case, a default of two is RECOMMENDED.

          If none of the mechanisms match and there is no "redirect"
          modifier, then the check_host() returns a result of "neutral", just
          as if "?all" were specified as the last directive.  If there is a
          "redirect" modifier, check_host() proceeds as defined in <xref

          It is better to use either a "redirect" modifier or an "all"

      <section title="Domain Specification" anchor="domain-spec">
        <t>
          Several of these mechanisms and modifiers have a domain-spec section.
          The domain-spec string is subject to macro expansion (see <xref
          target="macros"/>). The resulting string is the common presentation
          form of a fully-qualified DNS name: a series of labels separated by
          periods. This domain is called the &lt;target-name&gt; in the rest of
          this document.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note: The result of the macro expansion is not subject to any
          further escaping. Hence, this facility cannot produce all
          characters that are legal in a DNS label (e.g., the control
          characters).  However, this facility is powerful enough to express
          legal host names and common utility labels (such as "_spf") that
          are used in DNS.
        </t>
        <t>
          For several mechanisms, the domain-spec is optional.  If it is not
          provided, the &lt;domain&gt; from the check_host() arguments (see
          <xref target="arguments"/>) is used as the &lt;target-name&gt;.
          "domain" and domain-spec are syntactically identical after macro
          expansion.  "domain" is an input value for check_host() while
          domain-spec is computed by check_host().
        </t>
        <t>
          The result of evaluating check_host() with a syntactically invalid
          domain is undefined.

        This section defines two types of mechanisms: basic language framework
        mechanisms and designated sender mechanisms.

      <t>
        Basic mechanisms contribute to the language framework. They do not
        specify a particular type of authorization scheme.

      </figure>
      <t>
        Designated sender mechanisms are used to identify a set of
        &lt;ip&gt; addresses as being permitted or not permitted to use the
        &lt;domain&gt; for sending mail.

      <t>
        The following conventions apply to all mechanisms that perform a
        comparison between &lt;ip&gt; and an IP address at any point: 
      </t>
      <t>
        If no CIDR prefix length is given in the directive, then &lt;ip&gt; and
        the IP address are compared for equality.  (Here, CIDR is Classless
        Inter-Domain Routing, described in <xref target="RFC4632"/>.)
      </t>
      <t>
        If a CIDR prefix length is specified, then only the specified number of
        high-order bits of &lt;ip&gt; and the IP address are compared for
        equality. 
      </t>
      <t>
        When any mechanism fetches host addresses to compare with &lt;ip&gt;,
        when &lt;ip&gt; is an IPv4, "A" records are fetched; when &lt;ip&gt; is an
        IPv6 address, "AAAA" records are fetched.  SPF implementations on IPv6
        servers need to handle both "AAAA" and "A" records, for clients on IPv4
        mapped IPv6 addresses <xref target="RFC4291"/>.  IPv4 &lt;ip&gt;
        addresses are only listed in an SPF record using the "ip4" mechanism.
      </t>
      <t>
        Several mechanisms rely on information fetched from the DNS.  For these
        DNS queries, except where noted, if the DNS server returns an error
        (RCODE other than 0 or 3) or the query times out, the mechanism
        stops and the topmost check_host() returns "temperror".  If the server
        returns "domain does not exist" (RCODE 3), then evaluation of the
        mechanism continues as if the server returned no error (RCODE 0) and
        zero answer records.

          The "all" mechanism is a test that always matches. It is used as
          the rightmost mechanism in a record to provide an explicit default.

          For example:

          <!-- <?rfc compact="yes"?> -->
        </t>
        <t>
          Mechanisms after "all" will never be tested.  Mechanisms listed after
          "all" MUST be ignored. Any "redirect" modifier (<xref
          target="mod-redirect"/>) MUST be ignored when there is an "all"
          mechanism in the record.

                    check_host() is evaluated with the resulting string as the

                    remain the same as in the current evaluation of
                    check_host().
                  </t>
                  <t>
                    The recursive evaluation returns either match, not match,
                    or an error.  If it matches, then the appropriate result for
                    the include: mechanism is used (e.g. include or +include
                    produces a "pass" result and -include produces "fail").
                  </t>
                  <t>
                    If there is no match, the parent check_host() resumes
                    processing as per the table below, with the previous value
                    of &lt;domain&gt; restored.

              </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          In hindsight, the name "include" was poorly chosen.  Only the
          evaluated result of the referenced SPF record is used, rather than
          literally including the mechanisms of the referenced record in
          the first.  For example, evaluating a "-all" directive in the
          referenced record does not terminate the overall processing and
          does not necessarily result in an overall "fail".  (Better names
          for this mechanism would have been "if-match", "on-match", etc.)
        </t>
        <t>
          The "include" mechanism makes it possible for one domain to
          designate multiple administratively-independent domains.  For
          example, a vanity domain "example.net" might send mail using the
          servers of administratively-independent domains example.com and
          example.org.
        </t>
        <t>Example.net could say</t>
        <t>
          <list style="empty">
            <t>IN TXT "v=spf1 include:example.com include:example.org -all"</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          This would direct check_host() to, in effect, check the records of
          example.com and example.org for a "pass" result. Only if the host
          were not permitted for either of those domains would the result be
          "fail".
        </t>
        <t>
          Whether this mechanism matches, does not match, or returns an
          exception depends on the result of the recursive evaluation of
          check_host():
        </t>
        <texttable>
          <ttcol>A recursive check_host() result of:</ttcol>
          <ttcol>Causes the "include" mechanism to:</ttcol>

        </texttable>
        <t>
          The "include" mechanism is intended for crossing administrative
          boundaries.  For example, if example.com and example.org were managed
          by the same entity, and if the permitted set of hosts for both domains
          was "mx:example.com", it would be possible for example.org to specify
          "include:example.com", but it would be preferable to specify
          "redirect=example.com" or even "mx:example.com".
        </t>
        <t>
          With the "include" mechanism an administratively external set of hosts
          can be authorized, but determination of sender policy is still a
          function of the original domain's SPF record (as determined by the
          "all" mechanism in that record).  The redirect modifier is more
          suitable for consolidating both authorizations and policy into a
          common set to be shared within an ADMD.  Redirect is much more like a
          common code element to be shared among records in a single ADMD.  It
          is possible to control both authorized hosts and policy for an
          arbitrary number of domains from a single record.

          .arpa name servers. If used, proper PTR records have to be in place
          for the domain's hosts and the "ptr" mechanism SHOULD be one of the
          last mechanisms checked.  After many years of SPF deployment
          experience, it has been concluded it is unnecessary and more
          reliable alternatives should be used instead.  It is, however, still
          in use as part of the SPF protocol, so compliant check_host()
          implementations MUST support it.

          This mechanism is used to construct an arbitrary domain name that
          is used for a DNS A record query. It allows for complicated schemes

          The domain-spec is expanded as per <xref target="macros"/>. The
          resulting domain name is used for a DNS A RR lookup (even when the
          connection type is IPv6). If any A record is returned, this mechanism
          matches.
        </t>
        <t>
          Domains can use this mechanism to specify arbitrarily complex
          queries. For example, suppose example.com publishes the record:

          The &lt;target-name&gt; might expand to
          "1.2.0.192.someuser._spf.example.com". This makes fine-grained

        Modifiers are name/value pairs that provide additional information.
        Modifiers always have an "=" separating the name and the value.
      </t>
      <t>
        The modifiers defined in this document ("redirect" and "exp") SHOULD
        appear at the end of the record, after all mechanisms, though
        syntactically they can appear anywhere in the record.  Ordering of
        these two modifiers does not matter.  These two modifiers MUST NOT
        appear in a record more than once each.  If they do, then check_host()
        exits with a result of "permerror".
      </t>
      <t>
        Unrecognized modifiers MUST be ignored no matter where in a record,
        or how often.  This allows implementations of this document to
        gracefully handle records with modifiers that are defined in other
        specifications.
      </t>
      <section title="redirect: Redirected Query" anchor="mod-redirect">
        <t>
          The redirect modifier is intended for consolidating both
          authorizations and policy into a common set to be shared within a
          single ADMD.  It is possible to control both authorized hosts and
          policy for an arbitrary number of domains from a single record.          
        </t>
        <figure>
          <artwork type="abnf"><![CDATA[

        </figure>
        <t>
          If all mechanisms fail to match, and a "redirect" modifier is
          present, then processing proceeds as follows:
        </t>
        <t>
          The domain-spec portion of the redirect section is expanded as per
          the macro rules in <xref target="macros"/>. Then check_host() is
          evaluated with the resulting string as the &lt;domain&gt;. The
          &lt;ip&gt; and &lt;sender&gt; arguments remain the same as in the
          current evaluation of check_host().
        </t>
        <t>
          The result of this new evaluation of check_host() is then
          considered the result of the current evaluation with the exception
          that if no SPF record is found, or if the &lt;target-name&gt; is
          malformed, the result is a "permerror" rather than "none".
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that the newly-queried domain can itself specify redirect
          processing. 
        </t>
        <t>
          This facility is intended for use by organizations that wish to
          apply the same record to multiple domains. For example: 
        </t>
        <figure>
          <artwork>
  la.example.com. TXT "v=spf1 redirect=_spf.example.com"
  ny.example.com. TXT "v=spf1 redirect=_spf.example.com"
  sf.example.com. TXT "v=spf1 redirect=_spf.example.com"
_spf.example.com. TXT "v=spf1 mx:example.com -all"
          </artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          In this example, mail from any of the three domains is described by
          the same record. This can be an administrative advantage.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note: In general, the domain "A" cannot reliably use a redirect to
          another domain "B" not under the same administrative control. Since
          the &lt;sender&gt; stays the same, there is no guarantee that the
          record at domain "B" will correctly work for mailboxes in domain
          "A", especially if domain "B" uses mechanisms involving local-parts.
          An "include" directive will generally be more appropriate.
        </t>
        <t>
          For clarity, any "redirect" modifier SHOULD appear as the very last
          term in a record.

        <t>
          If check_host() results in a "fail" due to a mechanism match (such
          as "-all"), and the "exp" modifier is present, then the explanation
          string returned is computed as described below. If no "exp"
          modifier is present, then either a default explanation string or an
          empty explanation string MUST be returned to the calling application.
        </t>
        <t>
          The domain-spec is macro expanded (see <xref target="macros"/>) and
          becomes the &lt;target-name&gt;. The DNS TXT RRset for the
          &lt;target-name&gt; is fetched.
        </t>
        <t>
          If there are any DNS processing errors (any RCODE other than 0), or
          if no records are returned, or if more than one record is returned,
          or if there are syntax errors in the explanation string, then
          proceed as if no "exp" modifier was given.
        </t>
        <t>
          The fetched TXT record's strings are concatenated with no spaces,
          and then treated as an explain-string, which is macro-expanded.
          This final result is the explanation string.  Implementations MAY
          limit the length of the resulting explanation string to allow for
          other protocol constraints and/or reasonable processing limits.
          Since the explanation string is intended for an SMTP response and
          <xref target="RFC5321"/> Section 2.4 says that responses are in
          <xref target="US-ASCII"/>, the explanation string MUST be limited
          to <xref target="US-ASCII"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Software evaluating check_host() can use this string to communicate
          information from the publishing domain in the form of a short
          message or URL.  Software SHOULD make it clear that the explanation
          string comes from a third party. For example, it can prepend the
          macro string "%{o} explains: " to the explanation, such as shown in
          <xref target="handling-result-fail"/>.

          If transformers or delimiters are provided, the replacement value
          for a macro letter is split into parts separated by one or more of
	  the specified delimiter characters. After performing any
          reversal operation and/or removal of left-hand parts, the parts are
          rejoined using "." and not the original splitting characters.
        </t>
        <t>
          By default, strings are split on "." (dots). Note that no special
          treatment is given to leading, trailing, or consecutive delimiters in
          input strings, and so the list of parts might contain empty strings.
          Some older implementations of SPF prohibit trailing dots in domain
          names, so trailing dots SHOULD NOT be published, although they MUST
          be accepted by implementations conforming to this document.  Macros
          can specify delimiter characters that are used
          instead of ".".

        <t>
          The "r" transformer indicates a reversal operation: if the client
          IP address were 192.0.2.1, the macro %{i} would expand to
          "192.0.2.1" and the macro %{ir} would expand to "1.2.0.192".
        </t>
        <t>
          The DIGIT transformer indicates the number of right-hand parts to
          use, after optional reversal. If a DIGIT is specified, the value
          MUST be nonzero. If no DIGITs are specified, or if the value
          specifies more parts than are available, all the available parts
          are used. If the DIGIT was 5, and only 3 parts were available, the
          macro interpreter would pretend the DIGIT was 3. Implementations
          MUST support at least a value of 127, as that is the maximum number
          of labels in a domain name (less the zero-length label at the end).
        </t>
        <t>
          The "s" macro expands to the &lt;sender&gt; argument. It is an
          email address with a local-part, an "@" character, and a domain.
          The "l" macro expands to just the local-part. The "o" macro expands
          to just the domain part. Note that these values remain the same
          during recursive and chained evaluations due to "include" and/or
          "redirect".  Note also that if the original &lt;sender&gt; had no
          local-part, the local-part was set to "postmaster" in initial
          processing (see <xref target="initial"/>).
        </t>
        <t>
          For IPv4 addresses, both the "i" and "c" macros expand to the

        <t>
          For IPv6 addresses, the "i" macro expands to a dot-format address;
          it is intended for use in %{ir}. The "c" macro can expand to any of
          the hexadecimal colon-format addresses specified in <xref
          target="RFC4291"/>, Section 2.2. It is intended for humans to read.
        </t>
        <t>
          The "p" macro expands to the validated domain name of &lt;ip&gt;.
          The procedure for finding the validated domain name is defined in
          <xref target="mech-ptr"/>.  If the &lt;domain&gt; is present in the
          list of validated domains, it SHOULD be used.  Otherwise, if a
          subdomain of the &lt;domain&gt; is present, it SHOULD be used.
          Otherwise, any name from the list can be used.  If there are no
          validated domain names or if a DNS error occurs, the string
          "unknown" is used.
        </t>
        <t>
          This macro SHOULD NOT be published (see <xref target="mech-ptr"/> for
          the discussion).
        </t>
        <t>
          The "h" macro expands to the parameter that was provided to the
 	  SMTP server via the HELO or EHLO SMTP verb.  For sessions where that
	  verb was provided more than once, the most recent instance is
	  used.
	</t>
        <t>
          The "r" macro expands to the name of the receiving MTA. This SHOULD
          be a fully qualified domain name, but if one does not exist (as
          when the checking is done by a MUA) or if policy restrictions
          dictate otherwise, the word "unknown" SHOULD be substituted. The
          domain name can be different from the name found in the MX record
          that the client MTA used to locate the receiving MTA.
        </t>
        <t>
          The "t" macro expands to the decimal representation of the
          approximate number of seconds since the Epoch (Midnight, January 1,
          1970, UTC) at the time of the evaluation.  This is the same value as
          is returned by the POSIX time() function in most standards-compliant
          libraries.
        </t>
        <t>
          When the result of macro expansion is used in a domain name query,
          if the expanded domain name exceeds 253 characters (the maximum
          length of a domain name in this format), the left side is truncated
          to fit, by removing successive domain labels (and their following
          dots) until the total length does not exceed 253 characters.
        </t>
        <t>
          Uppercase macros expand exactly as their lowercase equivalents,
          and are then URL escaped.  URL escaping MUST be performed for
          characters not in the "unreserved" set, which is defined in <xref
          target="RFC3986"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Care has to be taken by the sending ADMD so that macro expansion
          for legitimate email does not exceed the 63-character limit on DNS
          labels.  The local-part of email addresses, in particular, can have
          more than 63 characters between dots.
        </t>
        <t>
          To minimize DNS lookup resource requirements, it is better if
          sending ADMDs avoid using the "s", "l", "o", or "h" macros
          in conjunction with any mechanism directive. Although these macros
          are powerful and allow per-user records to be published, they
          severely limit the ability of implementations to cache results of
          check_host() and they reduce the effectiveness of DNS caches.
        </t>
        <t>
          If no directive processed during the evaluation of check_host()
          contains an "s", "l", "o", or "h" macro, then the results of the
          evaluation can be cached on the basis of &lt;domain&gt; and &lt;ip&gt;
          alone for as long as the DNS record involved with the shortest TTL
          has not expired.

    <section title="Result Handling" anchor="handling">
        <t>
         This section provides guidance for operators in response to the  
         various possible outputs of check_host() on a message.  Definitions
         of SPF results are presented in <xref target='op-result'/>; this
         section provides more detail on each for use in developing local
         policy for message handling.    
       </t>
       <t>
         Every operating environment is different.  There are some receivers for
         whom strict adherence to SPF is appropriate, and definitive treatment
         of messages that are evaluated to be explicitly unauthorized ("fail"  
         and sometimes "softfail") is the norm.  There are others for which the
         "false negative" cases are more of a concern.  This concern is
         typically handled by merely recording the result in the header and
         allowing the message to pass on for additional processing.  There are
         still others where SPF is one of several inputs to the message
         handling decision.  As such, there is no comprehensive normative
         requirement for message handling in response to any particular result.
         This section is provided to present a complete picture of the likely
         cause of each result and, where available, the experience gained
         during experimental deployment.    
       </t>
       <t>
         There are essentially two classes of handling choices:   
          <list style="symbols">
              <t>
                 Handling within the SMTP session that attempted to deliver the   
                 message, such as by returning a permanent SMTP error
                 (rejection) or temporary SMTP error ("try again later");
              </t>
              <t>
                 Permitting the message to pass (a successful SMTP reply code)
                 and adding an additional header field that indicates the result  
                 returned by check_host() and other salient details; this is  
                 discussed in more detail in <xref target="results-headers"/>.
              </t>
          </list>
       </t>
       <section title="None" anchor="handling-result-none">
          <t>
            With a "none" result, the SPF verifier has no information at all 
            about the authorization or lack thereof of the client to use the 
            checked identity or identities.  The check_host() function completed
            without errors but was not able to reach any conclusion.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Neutral" anchor="handling-result-neutral">
          <t>
            A "neutral" result indicates that although a policy for the
            identity was discovered, there is no definite assertion (positive
            or negative) about the client.  
         </t>
         <t>
            A "neutral" result MUST be treated exactly like the "none" result;
            the distinction exists only for informational purposes.  Treating
            "neutral" more harshly than "none" would discourage ADMDs
            from testing the use of SPF records (see <xref
            target="sending-impl"/>).
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Pass"  anchor="handling-result-pass">
          <t>
            A "pass" result means that the client is authorized to inject
            mail with the given identity.  The domain can now, in the sense of
            reputation, be considered responsible for sending the message.
            Further policy checks can now proceed with confidence in the
            legitimate use of the identity.  This is further discussed in <xref
            target="receiver-policy-pass"/>.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Fail" anchor="handling-result-fail">
          <t>
            A "fail" result is an explicit statement that the client is not
            authorized to use the domain in the given identity.  Disposition of
            SPF fail messages is a matter of local policy. See <xref
            target="receiver-policy-fail"/> for considerations on developing
	    local policy.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the checking software chooses to reject the mail during the
            SMTP transaction, then it SHOULD use an SMTP reply code of 550
            (see <xref target="RFC5321"/>) and, if supported, the 5.7.1
            enhanced status code (see <xref target="RFC3463"/>, Section 3.8),
            in addition to an appropriate reply text.  The check_host()
            function will return either a default explanation string or one
            from the domain that published the SPF records (see <xref
            target="mod-exp"/>).  If the information does not originate with
            the checking software, it is good to make it clear that the text
            is provided by the sender's domain.  For example:
          </t>
          <figure>
            <artwork>
    550-5.7.1 SPF MAIL FROM check failed: 
    550-5.7.1 The domain example.com explains:
    550 5.7.1 Please see http://www.example.com/mailpolicy.html
            </artwork>
          </figure>
          <t>
            If the checking software chooses not to reject the mail during the
            SMTP transaction, then it SHOULD add a Received-SPF or
            Authentication-Results header field (see <xref
            target="results-headers"/>) to communicate this result to downstream
            message processors.  While this is true for all SPF results, it is
            of particular importance for "fail" results since the message is
            explicitly not authorized by the ADMD.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Softfail" anchor="handling-result-softfail">
          <t>
            A "softfail" result ought to be treated as somewhere between "fail"
            and "neutral"/"none".  The ADMD believes the host is not
            authorized but is not willing to make a strong policy statement.
            Receiving software SHOULD NOT reject the message based solely on
            this result, but MAY subject the message to closer scrutiny than
            normal.
          </t>
          <t>
            The ADMD wants to discourage the use of this host and
            thus desires limited feedback when a "softfail" result occurs.
            For example, the recipient's Mail User Agent (MUA) could
            highlight the "softfail" status, or the receiving MTA could give
            the sender a message using greylisting, <xref target="RFC6647"/>,
            with a note the first time the message is received, but accept it
            on a later attempt based on receiver policy.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Temperror" anchor="handling-result-temperror">
          <t>
            A "temperror" result means the SPF verifier encountered a transient
            (generally DNS) error while performing the check.  Checking
	     software can choose to accept or temporarily reject the message.
	     If the message is rejected during the SMTP transaction for this
	     reason, the software SHOULD use an SMTP reply code of 451 and, if
             supported, the 4.4.3 enhanced status code (see <xref
             target="RFC3463"/>, Section 3.5).  These errors can be
             caused by problems in either the sender's or receiver's DNS
 	     software.  See <xref target="receiver-policy-temperror"/> for
	     considerations on developing local policy.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Permerror" anchor="handling-result-permerror">
          <t>
            A "permerror" result means the domain's published records could not
            be correctly interpreted.  This signals an error condition that
            definitely requires operator intervention to be resolved.  If the
            message is rejected during the SMTP transaction for this reason, the
            software SHOULD use an SMTP reply code of 550 and, if supported, the
            5.5.2 enhanced status code (see <xref target="RFC3463"/>, Section
            3.6).  Be aware that if the ADMD uses macros (<xref
            target="macros"/>), it is possible that this result is due to the
            checked identities having an unexpected format.  It is also
            possible that this result is generated by certain SPF verifiers
            due to the input arguments having an unexpected format; see <xref
            target="domain-spec"/>.  See <xref
            target="receiver-policy-permerror"/> for considerations on
            developing local policy.
          </t>
        </section>
      </section>
    <section title="Recording the Result" anchor="results-headers">
        <t>
          To provide downstream agents, such as MUAs, with the information they
          might need in terms of evaluating or representing the apparent safety
          of the message content, it is RECOMMENDED that SMTP receivers record
          the result of SPF processing in the message header. For operators that
          choose to record SPF results in the header of the message for
          processing by internal filters or MUAs, two methods are presented.
          <xref target="received-spf"/> defines the Received-SPF field, which is
          the results field originally defined for SPF use.  <xref
          target="authres"/> discusses Authentication-Results  <xref
          target="RFC5451"/> which was specified more recently and is designed
          for use by SPF and other authentication methods.
        </t>
        <t>
          Both are in common use, and hence both are included here.  However, it
          is important to note that they were designed to serve slightly
          different purposes.  Received-SPF is intended to include enough
          information to enable reconstruction of the SPF evaluation of
          the message, while Authentication-Results is designed only to relay
          the result itself and related output details of likely use to end
          users (e.g., what property of the message was actually authenticated
          and what it contained), leaving reconstructive work to the purview
          of system logs and the Received field contents.  Also, Received-SPF
          relies on compliance of agents within the receiving ADMD to adhere
          to the header field ordering rules of <xref target='RFC5321'/> and
          <xref target='RFC5322'/>, while Authentication-Results includes some
          provisions to protect against non-compliant implementations.
        </t>
        <t>
          An operator could choose to use both to serve different downstream
          agents.  In such cases, care needs to be taken to ensure both fields
          are conveying the same details, or unexpected results can occur.
        </t>
      <section title="The Received-SPF Header Field" anchor="received-spf">
      <t>
        The Received-SPF header field is a trace field (see <xref
        target="RFC5322"/> Section 3.6.7) and SHOULD be prepended to the
        existing header, above the Received: field that is generated by the
        SMTP receiver.  It MUST appear above all other Received-SPF fields in
        the message.  The header field has the following format:

            It is also required to carefully weigh the cost and the
            maintainability of licit solutions.
          </t>
          <t>For example, consider a domain set up as follows:</t>

            There might be administrative considerations: using "a" over

            a DNS query per receiver. Using "mx" over "a" allows the set of
            mail hosts to be changed easily.  Unless such changes are common,
            it is better to use the less resource intensive mechanisms like
            "ip4" and "ip6" over "a" or "a" over "mx".

          <t>
            In some specific cases, standard advice on record content is
            appropriate.  Publishing SPF records for domains that send no mail
            is a well established best practice.  The record for a domain that
            sends no mail is:
            <figure>
              <artwork>
   www.example.com.   IN TXT  "v=spf1 -all"
              </artwork>
            </figure>
            Publishing SPF records for individual hosts is also best practice.
            The hostname is generally the identity used in the 5321.HELO/.EHLO
            command.  In the case of messages with a null 5321.MailFrom, this is
            used as the domain for 5321.MailFrom SPF checks, in addition to
            being used in 5321.HELO/.EHLO based SPF checks.  The standard SPF
            record for an individual host that is involved in mail processing
            is:
            <figure>
              <artwork>
   relay.example.com.   IN TXT  "v=spf1 a -all"

            </figure>

          <t>
            Validating correct deployment is difficult.  <xref target="RFC6652"/>

          <t>
            As explained in <xref target="mfrom-def"/>,  <xref

            typical of some Delivery Status Notification  <xref

            only entity available for performing an SPF check is the
            "HELO" identity defined in <xref target="helo-def"/>.
            SPF functionality is enhanced by administrators ensuring this
            identity is set correctly and has an appropriate SPF record. It is
            normal to have the HELO identity set to the hostname instead of
            the domain.  Zone file generation for significant numbers of hosts
            can be consolidated using the redirect modifier and scripted for
            initial deployment.  Specific deployment advice is given above in

          SPF results can be used in combination with other methods to determine
          the final local disposition (either positive or negative) of a

        </t>
        <t>
          An attempt to have one organization (sender) direct the email   
          handling policies of another (receiver) is inherently challenging and    
          often controversial.  As stated elsewhere in this document, there is 
          no comprehensive normative requirement for specific handling of a
          message based on SPF results.  The information presented in <xref
          target="handling"/> and in <xref target="local-policy"/> is offered
          for receiver consideration when forming local handling policies.
        </t>
        <t>
          The primary considerations are that SPF might return "pass" for mail 
          that is ultimately harmful (e.g., spammers that arrange for SPF to   
          pass using disposable domain names, or virus or spam outbreaks from    
          within trusted sources), and might also return "fail" for mail that  
          is ultimately legitimate (e.g., legitimate mail that has traversed a 
          mail alias).  It is important take both of these cases under 
          consideration when establishing local handling policy.

      <section title="Mediators" anchor="middle-lists">
        <t>
          Mediators are a type of User actor <xref target="RFC5598"/>.  That is,
          a mediator takes 'delivery' of a message and posts a 'submission' of a
          new message.  The mediator can make the newly-posted message be as
          similar or as different from the original message as they wish.
          Examples include mailing lists (see <xref target="RFC5598"/> Section
          5.3) and ReSenders (<xref target="RFC5598"/> Section 5.2).  This is
          discussed in <xref target="RFC5321"/>, Section 3.9.  For the operation
          of SPF, the essential concern is the email address in the
          5321.MailFrom command for the new message.
        </t>
        <t>
          Because SPF evaluation is based on the IP address of the "last"
          sending SMTP server, the address of the mediator will be used, rather
          than the address of the SMTP server that sent the message to the
          mediator.  Some mediators retain the email address from the original
          message, while some use a new address.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the address is the same as for the original message, and the
          original message had an associated SPF record, then the SPF
          evaluation will fail unless mitigations such as those described in

          <vspace/>
          <!-- FIXME: prevent automatic line break in "Denial-of-Service" -->
          Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.  The processing limits outlined

          as the following:

            <t>
              A malicious party could create an SPF record with many
              references to a victim's domain and send many emails to
              different SPF verifiers; those SPF verifiers would then create a
              DoS attack.  In effect, the SPF verifiers are being used to
              amplify the attacker's bandwidth by using fewer octets in the
              SMTP session than are used by the DNS queries.  Using SPF
              verifiers also allows the attacker to hide the true source of
              the attack.  This potential attack is based on large volumes of
              mail being transmitted.
            </t>
            <t>
              Whereas implementations of check_host() are supposed to limit
              the number of DNS lookups, malicious domains could publish
              records that exceed these limits in an attempt to waste
              computation effort at their targets when they send them mail.
              Malicious domains could also design SPF records that cause
              particular implementations to use excessive memory or CPU
              usage, or to trigger bugs.  If a receiver is configured to
              accept mail with an SPF result of "temperror", such an attack
              might result in mail that would otherwise have been rejected due
              to an SPF "fail" result being accepted.  This potential attack
              is based on specially crafted SPF records being used to
              exhaust DNS resources of the victim.
            </t>
            <t>
              Malicious parties could send a large volume of mail purporting
              to come from the intended target to a wide variety of
              legitimate mail hosts.  These legitimate machines would then
              present a DNS load on the target as they fetched the relevant
              records.
            </t>
            <t>
              Malicious parties could, in theory, use SPF records as a vehicle
              for DNS lookup amplification for a denial-of-service-attack.  In
              this scenario, the attacker publishes an SPF record in its own DNS
              that uses "a" and "mx" mechanisms directed toward the intended
              victim, e.g. "a:example.com a:foo.example.com a:bar.example.com
              ..." and then distributes mail with a MAIL FROM value including
              its own domain in large volume to a wide variety of destinations.
              Any such destination operating an SPF verifier will begin querying
              all of the names associated with the "a" mechanisms in that
              record.  The names used in the record needn't exist for the attack
              to be effective.  Operational experience since publication of
              <xref target="RFC4408"/> suggests that mitigation of this class of
              attack can be accomplished with minimal impact on the deployed
              base by having the verifier abort processing and return
              "permerror" (<xref target="op-result-permerror"/>) once more than
              two "void lookups" have been encountered (defined in <xref

        <t>
          Of these, the case of a third party referenced in the SPF record is
          the easiest for a DoS attack to effectively exploit. As a result,
          limits that might seem reasonable for an individual mail server can
          still allow an unreasonable amount of bandwidth amplification.
          Therefore, the processing limits need to be quite low.

          Do not construe the "MAIL FROM" and "HELO" identity authorizations to

          malicious sender to inject a message using his own domain in the
          identities used by SPF, to have that domain's SPF record authorize the
          sending host, and yet the message can easily list other identities in

          authorized MTAs, not whole email addresses to sets of authorized
          users.  Although the "l" macro (<xref target="macros"/>) provides a
          limited way to define individual sets of authorized MTAs for
          specific email addresses, it is generally impossible to verify,
          through SPF, the use of specific email addresses by individual
          users of the same MTA.
        </t>
        <t>
          It is up to mail services and their MTAs to directly prevent<vspace/>
          cross-user forgery: based on SMTP AUTH (<xref target="RFC4954"/>),
          users have to be restricted to using only those email addresses
          that are actually under their control (see <xref
          target="RFC6409"/>, Section 6.1).  Another means to verify the
          identity of individual users is message cryptography such as PGP
          (<xref target="RFC4880"/>) or S/MIME (<xref target="RFC5751"/>).
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Untrusted Information Sources">
        <t>
          An SPF compliant receiver gathers information from the SMTP commands
          it receives and from the published DNS records of the sending
          domain holder, (e.g., "HELO" domain name, the "MAIL FROM" address
          from the envelope, and SPF DNS records published by the domain
          holder).  These parameters are not validated in the SMTP process.
        </t>
        <t>
          All of these pieces of information are generated by actors outside
          of the authority of the receiver, and thus are not guaranteed to be
          accurate or legitimate.
        </t>
        <section title="Recorded Results">
        <t>
          This information, passed to the receiver in the Received-SPF: or
          Authentication-Results: trace fields, can be returned to the client
          MTA as an SMTP rejection message.  If such an SMTP rejection message
          is generated, the information from the trace fields has to be checked
          for such problems as invalid characters and excessively long lines.
        </t>
        </section>
        <section title="External Explanations">
        <t>
          When the authorization check fails, an explanation string could be
          included in the reject response.  Both the sender and the rejecting
          receiver need to be aware that the explanation was determined by
          the publisher of the SPF record checked and, in general, not the
          receiver.  The explanation can contain malicious URLs, or it might be
          offensive or misleading.
        </t>
        <t>
          Explanations returned to sender domains due to "exp" modifiers
          (<xref target="mod-exp"/>) were generated by the sender policy
          published by the domain holders themselves.  As long as messages are
          only returned with non-delivery notification (<xref
          target="RFC3464"/>) to domains publishing the explanation strings from
          their own DNS SPF records, the only affected parties are the original
          publishers of the domain's SPF records.
        </t>
        <t>
          In practice, such non-delivery notifications can be misdirected,
          such as when an MTA accepts an email and only later generates the
          notification to a forged address, or when an email forwarder does
          not direct the bounce back to the original sender.
        </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Macro Expansion">
        <t>
          Macros (<xref target="macros"/>) allow senders to inject arbitrary
          text (any non-null <xref target="US-ASCII"/> character) into receiver
          DNS queries.  It is necessary to be prepared for hostile or unexpected
          content.
        </t>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section title="Privacy Exposure">
        <t>
          Checking SPF records causes DNS queries to be sent to the domain
          owner.  These DNS queries, especially if they are caused by the
          "exists" mechanism, can contain information about who is sending
          email and likely to which MTA the email is being sent.  This can
          introduce some privacy concerns, which are more or less of an
          issue depending on local laws and the relationship between the
          ADMD and the person sending the email.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Delivering Mail Producing a 'Fail' Result">
        <t>
          Operators that choose to deliver mail for which SPF produces a "fail"    
          result need to understand that they are admitting content that is    
          explicitly not authorized by the purported sender.  While there are  
          known failure modes that can be considered "false negatives", the    
          distinct choice to admit those messages increases end-user exposure  
          to likely harm.  This is especially true for domains belonging to    
          known good actors that are typically well-behaved; unauthorized mail 
          from those sources might well be subjected to much higher skepticism 
          and content analysis.    
        </t>
        <t>
          SPF does not, however, include the capacity for identifying good 
          actors from bad ones, nor does it handle the concept of known actors 
          versus unknown ones.  Those notions are out of scope for this    
          specification.

      <section title="The SPF DNS Record Type">
        <t>
          Per <xref target="RFC4408"/>, the IANA assigned the Resource Record
          Type and Qtype from the DNS Parameters Registry for the SPF RR type
          with code 99.   The format of this type is identical to the TXT RR
          <xref target="RFC1035"/>.  The character content of the record is
          encoded as <xref target="US-ASCII"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Studies have shown that RRTYPE 99 has not seen any substantial use,
          and in fact its existence and mechanism defined in [RFC4408] has led
          to some interoperability issues.  Accordingly, its use is now
          obsolete, and new implementations are not to use it.
        </t>
        <t>
          IANA is requested to update the Resource Record (RR) TYPEs registry
          to indicate that this document is the reference document for that
          RRTYPE.

          Say that your sender policy requires both that the IP address is
          within a certain range and that the reverse DNS for the IP matches.
          This can be done several ways, including the following:
        </t>
        <figure>
          <artwork>
example.com.           SPF  ( "v=spf1 "

ip4._spf.example.com.  SPF  "v=spf1 -ip4:192.0.2.0/24 +all"

          There are three places that techniques can be used to ameliorate

          <section title="Originating ADMDs" anchor="forwarding-solutions-orig">

              The beginning, when email is first sent:
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>
                  "Neutral" results could be given for IP addresses that might
                  be forwarders, instead of "fail" results based on a list of
                  known reliable forwarders.  For example:
                  <list style="empty">
                    <t>"v=spf1 mx ?exists:%{ir}.whitlist.example.org -all"</t>
                  </list>
                  This would cause a lookup on an DNS white list (DNSWL) and
                  cause a result of "fail" only for email not either coming
                  from the domain's mx host(s) (SPF pass) or white listed
                  sources (SPF neutral).  This, in effect, outsources an
                  element of sender policy to the maintainer of the whitelist.
                </t>
                <t>
                  The "MAIL FROM" identity could have additional information
                  in the local-part that cryptographically identifies the mail
                  as coming from an authorized source.  In this case, such an
                  SPF record could be used:
                  <list style="empty">
                    <t>"v=spf1 mx exists:%{l}._spf_verify.%{d} -all"</t>
                  </list>
                  Then, a specialized DNS server can be set up to serve the
                  _spf_verify subdomain that validates the local-part.
                  Although this requires an extra DNS lookup, this happens
                  only when the email would otherwise be rejected as not
                  coming from a known good source.
                  <vspace/>
                  Note that due to the 63-character limit for domain labels,
                  this approach only works reliably if the local-part
                  signature scheme is guaranteed either to only produce
                  local-parts with a maximum of 63 characters or to gracefully
                  handle truncated local-parts.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Similarly, a specialized DNS server could be set up that
                  will rate-limit the email coming from unexpected IP
                  addresses.
                  <list style="empty">
                    <t>"v=spf1 mx exists:%{ir}._spf_rate.%{d} -all"</t>

                  Mediators can solve the problem by rewriting the "MAIL FROM"
                  to be in their own domain.  This means mail rejected from the
                  external mailbox will have to be forwarded back to the
                  original sender by the forwarding service.  Various schemes to
                  do this exist though they vary widely in complexity and

    <section title="Mail Services" anchor="mail-services">
        <t>
          MSPs (Mail Service Providers - <xref target="RFC5598"/> Section 2.3)
          that offer mail services to third-party domains, such as sending of
          bulk mail, might want to adjust their configurations in light of the
          authorization check described in this document.  If the domain part of
          the "MAIL FROM" identity used for such email uses the domain of
          one of the MSPs domain, then the provider needs only to ensure that its
          sending host is authorized by its own SPF record, if any.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the "MAIL FROM" identity does not use the MSP's domain, then
          extra care has to be taken.  The SPF record format has several options
          for the third-party domain to authorize the service provider's MTAs to
          send mail on its behalf.  For MSPs, such as ISPs, that have a wide
          variety of customers using the same MTA, steps are required to mitigate
          the risk of cross-customer forgery (see <xref
          target="cross-user-forgery"/>).
        </t>
    </section>
    <section title="MTA Relays" anchor="mta-relays">
        <t>
          Relays are described in <xref target="RFC5598"/> Section 2.2.2.  The
          authorization check generally precludes the use of arbitrary
          MTA relays between sender and receiver of an email message.
        </t>
        <t>
          Within an organization, MTA relays can be effectively deployed.
          However, for purposes of this document, such relays are effectively
          transparent.  The SPF authorization check is a check between border
          MTAs of different ADMDs.
        </t>
        <t>
          For mail senders, this means that published SPF records have to
          authorize any MTAs that actually send across the Internet.
          Usually, these are just the border MTAs as internal MTAs simply
          forward mail to these MTAs for relaying.
        </t>
        <t>
          The receiving ADMD will generally want to perform the authorization
          check at the boundary MTAs, including all secondary MXs.  Internal
          MTAs (including MTAs that might serve both as boundary MTAs and
          internal relays from secondary MXs when they are processing the
          relayed mail stream) then do not perform the authorization test.  To
          perform the authorization test other than at the boundary, the host
          that first transferred the message to the receiving ADMD have to be
          determined, which can be difficult to extract from the message header
          because (a) header fields can be forged or malformed, and (b) there's
          no standard way to encode that information such that it can be
          reliably extracted.  Testing other than at the boundary is likely to
          produce unreliable results.  This is described further in Appendix C
          of <xref target="RFC5451"/>.

    <section title="Local Policy Considerations" anchor="local-policy">
        <t>
          SPF results can be used in combination with other methods to determine
          the final local disposition (either positive or negative of a message.
          It can also be considered dispositive on its own.
        </t>
        <section title="Policy For SPF Pass" anchor="receiver-policy-pass">
        <t>
          SPF pass results can be used in combination with "white lists" of
          known "good" domains to bypass some or all additional pre-delivery
          email checks.  Exactly which checks and how to determine appropriate
          white list entries has to be based on local conditions and
          requirements.
        </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Policy For SPF Fail" anchor="receiver-policy-fail">
        <t>
          SPF fail results can be used to reject messages during the SMTP
          transaction based on either "MAIL FROM" or "HELO"
          identity results.  This reduces resource requirements for various
          content filtering methods and conserves bandwidth since rejection can
          be done before the SMTP content is transferred.  It also gives
          immediate feedback to the sender who might then be able to resolve the
          issue.  Due to some of the issues described above in this section
          (<xref target="implications"/>), SPF based rejection does present some
          risk of rejecting legitimate email when rejecting based on
          "MAIL FROM" results.
        </t>
        <t>
          SPF fail results can alternately be used as one input into a larger
          set of evaluations which might, based on a combination with other
          evaluation techniques, result in the email being marked negatively in
          some way (this might be via delivery to a special spam folder,
          modifying subject lines, or other locally determined means).
          Developing the details of such an approach have to be based on local
          conditions and requirements.  Using SPF results in this way does not
          have the advantages of resource conservation and immediate feedback to
          the sender associated with SMTP rejection, but could produce fewer
          undesirable rejections in a well designed system.  Such an approach
          might result in email that was not authorized by the sending ADMD
          being unknowingly delivered to end users.
        </t>
        <t>
          Either general approach can be used as they both leave a clear
          disposition of emails.  They are either delivered in some manner or
          the sender is notified of the failure.  Other dispositions such as
          "dropping" or deleting email after acceptance are inappropriate
          because they leave uncertainty and reduce the overall reliability
          and utility of email across the Internet.

        <section title="Policy For SPF Permerror" anchor="receiver-policy-permerror">
        <t>
          The "permerror" result (see <xref target="op-result-permerror"/>)
          indicates the SPF processing module at the receiver determined that
          the retrieved SPF policy record could not be interpreted.  This
          gives no true indication about the authorized use of the data found
          in the envelope.
        </t>
        <t>
          As with all results, implementers have a choice to make regarding what
          to do with a message that yields this result.  SMTP allows only a few
          basic options.
        </t>
        <t>
          Rejection of the message is an option, in that it is the one thing a
          receiver can do to draw attention to the difficulty encountered while
          protecting itself from messages that do not have a definite SPF result
          of some kind.  However, if the SPF implementation is defective and
          returns spurious "permerror" results, only the sender is actively
          notified of the defect (in the form of rejected mail), and not the
          receiver making use of SPF.
        </t>
        <t>
          The less intrusive handling choice is to deliver the message, perhaps
          with some kind of annotation of the difficulty encountered and/or
          logging of a similar nature.  However, this will not be desirable to
          operators that wish to implement SPF checking as strictly as possible,
          nor is this sort of passive problem reporting typically effective.
        </t>
        <t>
          There is of course the option placing this choice in the hands of the
          operator rather than the implementer since this kind of choice is
          often a matter of local policy rather than a condition with a
          universal solution, but this adds one more piece of complexity to an
          already non-trivial environment.
        </t>
        <t>
          Both implementers and operators need to be cautious of all choices and
          outcomes when handling SPF results.

        <section title="Policy For SPF Temperror" anchor="receiver-policy-temperror">
        <t>
          The "temperror" result (see <xref target="op-result-temperror"/>)
          indicates the SPF processing module at the receiver could not
          retrieve and SPF policy record due to a (probably) transient
          condition.  This gives no true indication about the authorized use
          of the data found in the envelope.

          Deferring the message is an option, in that it is the one thing a

          of some kind.  However, if the SPF implementation is defective and
          returns spurious "temperror" results, only the sender is actively
          notified of the defect (in the form of mail rejected after it times
          out of the sending queue), and not the receiver making use of SPF.
        </t>
        <t>
          Because of long queue lifetimes, it is possible that mail will be
          repeatedly deferred for several days and so any awareness by the
          sender of a problem could be quite delayed.  If "temperrors"
          persist for multiple delivery attempts, it might be preferable to
          treat the error as permanent and reduce the amount of time the
          message is in transit.

    <section title="Protocol Status">
        <t>
          NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: To be removed prior to publication.
        </t>
        <t>
          SPF has been in development since the summer of 2003 and has seen
          deployment beyond the developers beginning in December 2003.  The
          design of SPF slowly evolved until the spring of 2004 and has since
          stabilized. There have been quite a number of forms of SPF, some
          written up as documents, some submitted as Internet Drafts, and
          many discussed and debated in development forums.  The protocol was
          originally defined in <xref target="RFC4408"/>, which this document
          replaces.
        </t>
        <t>
          <xref target="RFC4408"/> was designed to clearly document the protocol
          defined by earlier draft specifications of SPF as used in existing
          implementations.  This updated specification is intended to clarify
          identified ambiguities in <xref target="RFC4408"/>, resolve technical
          issues identified in post-RFC 4408 deployment experience, and document
          widely deployed extensions to SPF that have been developed since
          <xref target="RFC4408"/> was published.
        </t>
      <t>
        This document updates and replaces RFC 4408 that was part of a group of
        simultaneously published Experimental RFCs (RFC 4405, RFC 4406, RFC 4407,
        and RFC 4408) in 2006.  At that time the IESG requested the community
        observe the success or failure of the two approaches documented in these
        RFCs during the two years following publication, in order that a
        community consensus could be reached in the future.
      </t>
      <t>
        SPF is widely deployed by large and small email providers alike.  There
        are multiple, interoperable implementations.
      </t>
      <t>
        For SPF (as documented in RFC 4408) a careful effort was made to collect
        and document lessons learned and errata during the two year period.  The
        errata list has been stable (no new submissions) and only minor protocol
        lessons learned were identified.  Resolution of the IESG's experiment
        is documented in  <xref target="RFC6686"/>.

       Using GSS-API Mechanisms in SASL: The GS2 Mechanism Family
                         draft-ietf-sasl-gs2-20

Abstract

   This document describes how to use a Generic Security Service
   Application Program Interface (GSS-API) mechanism in the the Simple
   Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework.  This is done by
   defining a new SASL mechanism family, called GS2.  This mechanism
   family offers a number of improvements over the previous "SASL/
   GSSAPI" mechanism: it is more general, uses fewer messages for the
   authentication phase in some cases, and supports negotiable use of
   channel binding.  Only GSS-API mechanisms that support channel
   binding are supported.

Internet-Draft                 SASL GS2-*                   January 2010


1.  Introduction

   Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
   [RFC2743] is a framework that provides security services to
   applications using a variety of authentication mechanisms.  Simple
   Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) [RFC4422] is a framework to
   provide authentication and security layers for connection based
   protocols, also using a variety of mechanisms.  This document
   describes how to use a GSS-API mechanism as though it were a SASL
   mechanism.  This facility is called GS2 -- a moniker that indicates
   that this is the second GSS-API->SASL mechanism bridge.  The original
   GSS-API->SASL mechanism bridge was specified by [RFC2222], now
   [RFC4752]; we shall sometimes refer to the original bridge as GS1 in
   this document.

   All GSS-API mechanisms are implicitly registered for use within SASL
   by this specification.  The SASL mechanisms defined in this document
   are known as the GS2 family of mechanisms.

   The GS1 bridge failed to gain wide deployment for any GSS-API
   mechanism other than "The Kerberos V5 GSS-API mechanism" [RFC1964]
   [RFC4121], and has a number of problems that led us to desire a new
   bridge.  Specifically: a) GS1 was not round-trip optimized, b) GS1
   did not support channel binding [RFC5056].  These problems and the
   opportunity to create the next SASL password-based mechanism, Salted
   Challenge Response (SCRAM) SASL and GSS-API Mechanism
   [I-D.ietf-sasl-scram], as a GSS-API mechanism used by SASL
   applications via GS2, provide the motivation for GS2.

   In particular, the current consensus of the SASL community appears to
   be that SASL "security layers" (i.e., confidentiality and integrity
   protection of application data after authentication) are too complex
   and redundant because SASL applications tend to have an option to run
   over a Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] channel.  Use of SASL
   security layers is best replaced with channel binding to a TLS
   channel.

   GS2 is designed to be as simple as possible.  It adds to GSS-API
   security context token exchanges only the bare minimum to support
   SASL semantics and negotiation of use of channel binding.
   Specifically, GS2 adds a small header (a few bytes plus the length of
   the client requested SASL authorization identity) to the initial GSS-
   API context token and to the application channel binding data.  GS2
   uses SASL mechanism negotiation to implement channel binding
   negotiation.  All GS2 plaintext is protected via the use of GSS-API
   channel binding.  Additionally, to simplify the implementation of GS2
   mechanisms for implementors who will not implement a GSS-API
   framework, we compress the initial security context token header

   required by [RFC2743] (see section 3.1).


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The document uses many terms and function names defined in [RFC2743]
   as updated by [RFC5554].


3.  Mechanism name

   There are two SASL mechanism names for any GSS-API mechanism used
   through this facility.  One denotes that the server supports channel
   binding.  The other denotes that it does not.

   The SASL mechanism name for a GSS-API mechanism is that which is
   provided by that mechanism when it was specified, if one was
   specified.  This name denotes that the server does not support
   channel binding.  Add the suffix "-PLUS" and the resulting name
   denotes that the server does support channel binding.  SASL
   implementations can use the GSS_Inquire_SASLname_for_mech call (see
   below) to query for the SASL mechanism name of a GSS-API mechanism.

   If the GSS_Inquire_SASLname_for_mech interface is not used, the GS2
   implementation needs some other mechanism to map mechanism OIDs to
   SASL names internally.  In this case, the implementation can only
   support the mechanisms for which it knows the SASL name.  If the
   GSS_Inquire_SASLname_for_mech call fails, and the GS2 implementation
   cannot map the OID to a SASL mechanism name using some other means,
   it cannot use the particular GSS-API mechanism since it does not know
   its SASL mechanism name.

3.1.  Generating SASL mechanism names from GSS-API OIDs

   For GSS-API mechanisms whose SASL names are not defined together with
   the GSS-API mechanism or in this document, the SASL mechanism name is
   concatenation of the string "GS2-" and the Base32 encoding [RFC4648]
   (with an upper case alphabet) of the first 55 bits of the binary
   SHA-1 hash [FIPS.180-1.1995] string computed over the ASN.1 DER
   encoding [CCITT.X690.2002], including the tag and length octets, of
   the GSS-API mechanism's Object Identifier.  The Base32 rules on
   padding characters and characters outside of the Base32 alphabet are
   not relevant to this use of Base32.  If any padding or non-alphabet
   characters are encountered, the name is not a GS2 family mechanism

   name.  This name denotes that the server does not support channel
   binding.  Add the suffix "-PLUS" and the resulting name denotes that
   the server does support channel binding.

   A GS2 mechanism that has a non-OID-derived SASL mechanism name is
   said to have a "user friendly SASL mechanism name".

3.2.  Computing mechanism names manually

   The hash-derived GS2 SASL mechanism name may be computed manually.
   This is useful when the set of supported GSS-API mechanisms is known
   in advance.  This eliminates the need to implement Base32, SHA-1 and
   DER in the SASL mechanism.  The computed mechanism name can be used
   directly in the implementation, and the implementation need not be
   concerned if the mechanism is part of a mechanism family.

3.3.  Examples

   The OID for the SPKM-1 mechanism [RFC2025] is 1.3.6.1.5.5.1.1.  The
   ASN.1 DER encoding of the OID, including the tag and length, is (in
   hex) 06 07 2b 06 01 05 05 01 01.  The SHA-1 hash of the ASN.1 DER
   encoding is (in hex) 1c f8 f4 2b 5a 9f 80 fa e9 f8 31 22 6d 5d 9d 56
   27 86 61 ad.  Convert the first 7 octets to binary, drop the last
   bit, and re-group them in groups of 5, and convert them back to
   decimal, which results in these computations:

   hex:
   1c f8 f4 2b 5a 9f 80

   binary:
   00011100 11111000 11110100 00101011 01011010
   10011111 1000000

   binary in groups of 5:
   00011 10011 11100 01111 01000 01010 11010 11010
   10011 11110 00000

   decimal of each group:
   3 19 28 15 8 10 26 26 19 30 0

   base32 encoding:
   D T 4 P I K 2 2 T 6 A

   The last step translates each decimal value using table 3 in Base32
   [RFC4648].  Thus the SASL mechanism name for the SPKM-1 GSSAPI
   mechanism is "GS2-DT4PIK22T6A".

   The OID for the Kerberos V5 GSS-API mechanism [RFC1964] is

   1.2.840.113554.1.2.2 and its DER encoding is (in hex) 06 09 2A 86 48
   86 F7 12 01 02 02.  The SHA-1 hash is 82 d2 73 25 76 6b d6 c8 45 aa
   93 25 51 6a fc ff 04 b0 43 60.  Convert the 7 octets to binary, drop
   the last bit, and re-group them in groups of 5, and convert them back
   to decimal, which results in these computations:

   hex:
   82 d2 73 25 76 6b d6

   binary:
   10000010 11010010 01110011 00100101 01110110
   01101011 1101011

   binary in groups of 5:
   10000 01011 01001 00111 00110 01001 01011 10110
   01101 01111 01011

   decimal of each group:
   16 11 9 7 6 9 11 22 13 15 11

   base32 encoding:
   Q L J H G J L W N P L

   The last step translates each decimal value using table 3 in Base32
   [RFC4648].  Thus the SASL mechanism name for the Kerberos V5 GSSAPI
   mechanism would be "GS2-QLJHGJLWNPL" and (because this mechanism
   supports channel binding) "GS2-QLJHGJLWNPL-PLUS".  Instead, the next
   section assigns the Kerberos V5 mechanism a non-hash-derived
   mechanism name.

3.4.  Grandfathered mechanism names

   Some older GSS-API mechanisms were not specified with a SASL GS2
   mechanism name.  Using a shorter name can be useful nonetheless.  We
   specify the names "GS2-KRB5" and "GS2-KRB5-PLUS" for the Kerberos V5
   mechanism, to be used as if the original specification documented it.
   See Section 15.


4.  SASL Authentication Exchange Message Format

   During the SASL authentication exchange for GS2, a number of messages
   following the following format is sent between the client and server.
   On success, this number is the same as the number of context tokens
   that the GSS-API mechanism would normally require in order to
   establish a security context.  On failures, the exchange can be
   terminated early by any party.

Internet-Draft                 SASL GS2-*                   January 2010


   When using a GS2 mechanism the SASL client is always a GSS-API
   initiator and the SASL server is always a GSS-API acceptor.  The
   client calls GSS_Init_sec_context and the server calls
   GSS_Accept_sec_context.

   All the SASL authentication messages exchanged are exactly the same
   as the security context tokens of the GSS-API mechanism, except for
   the initial security context token.

   The client and server MAY send GSS-API error tokens (tokens output by
   GSS_Init_sec_context() or GSS_Accept_sec_context() when the major
   status code is other than GSS_S_COMPLETE or GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED).
   As this indicates an error condition, after sending the token, the
   sending side should fail the authentication.

   The initial security context token is modified as follows:
   o  The initial context token header (see section 3.1 of [RFC2743])
      MUST be removed if present.  If the header is not present, the
      client MUST send a "gs2-nonstd-flag" flag (see below).  On the
      server side this header MUST be recomputed and restored prior to
      passing the token to GSS_Accept_sec_context, except when the "gs2-
      nonstd-flag" is sent.
   o  A GS2 header MUST be prefixed to the resulting initial context
      token.  This header has the form "gs2-header" given below in ABNF
      [RFC5234].

   The figure below describes the permissible attributes, their use, and
   the format of their values.  All attribute names are single US-ASCII
   letters and are case-sensitive.

                        ;; The GS2 header is gs2-header.

   When the "gs2-nonstd-flag" flag is present, the client did not find/
   remove a token header ([RFC2743] section 3.1) from the initial token
   returned by GSS_Init_sec_context.  This signals to the server that it
   MUST NOT re-add the data that is normally removed by the client.

   The "gs2-cb-flag" signals the channel binding mode.  One of "p", "n",
   or "y" is used.  A "p" means the client supports and used a channel
   binding, and the name of the channel binding type is indicated.  A
   "n" means that the client does not support channel binding.  A "y"
   means the client supports channel binding, but believes the server
   does not support it, so it did not use a channel binding.  See the
   next section for more details.

   The "gs2-authzid" holds the SASL authorization identity.  It is
   encoded using UTF-8 [RFC3629] with three exceptions:
   o  The NUL character is forbidden as required by section 3.4.1 of
      [RFC4422].
   o  The server MUST replace any "," (comma) in the string with "=2C".
   o  The server MUST replace any "=" (equals) in the string with "=3D".
   Upon receipt of this value the server verifies its correctness
   according to the used SASL protocol profile.  Failed verification

   results in a failed authentication exchange.


5.  Channel Bindings

   GS2 supports channel binding to external secure channels, such as
   TLS.  Clients and servers may or may not support channel binding,
   therefore the use of channel binding is negotiable.  GS2 does not
   provide security layers, however, therefore it is imperative that GS2
   provide integrity protection for the negotiation of channel binding.

   Use of channel binding is negotiated as follows:
   o  Servers SHOULD advertise both non-PLUS and the PLUS-variant of
      each GS2 mechanism name.  If the server cannot support channel
      binding, it MAY advertise only the non-PLUS variant.  If the
      server would never succeed authentication of the non-PLUS variant
      due to policy reasons, it MAY advertise only the PLUS-variant.
   o  If the client negotiates mechanisms then clients MUST select the
      PLUS-variant if offered by the server.  Otherwise (the client does
      not negotiate mechanisms), if the client has no prior knowledge
      about mechanisms supported by the server and wasn't explicitly
      configured to use a particular variant of the GS2 mechanism, then
      it MUST select only non-PLUS version of the GS2 mechanism.
   o  If the client does not support channel binding then it MUST use a
      "n" gs2-cb-flag.
   o  If the client supports channel binding and the server does not
      appear to (i.e., the client did not see the -PLUS name) then the
      client MUST either fail authentication or it MUST chose the non-
      PLUS mechanism name and use a "y" gs2-cb-flag.
   o  If the client supports channel binding and the server appears to
      support it (i.e., the client see the -PLUS name), or if the client
      wishes to use channel binding but the client does not negotiate
      mechanisms, then the client MUST use a "p" gs2-cb-flag to indicate
      the channel binding type it is using.
   o  The client generate the chan_bindings input parameter for
      GSS_Init_sec_context as described below.
   o  Upon receipt of the initial authentication message the server
      checks the gs2-cb-flag in the GS2 header and constructs a
      chan_bindings parameter for GSS_Accept_sec_context as described
      below.  If the client channel binding flag was "y" and the server
      did advertise support for channel bindings then the server MUST
      fail authentication.  If the client channel binding flag was "p"
      and the server does not support the indicated channel binding type
      then the server MUST fail authentication.

   For more discussions of channel bindings, and the syntax of the
   channel binding data for various security protocols, see [RFC5056].

5.1.  Content of GSS-CHANNEL-BINDINGS structure

   The calls to GSS_Init_sec_context and GSS_Accept_sec_context take a
   chan_bindings parameter.  The value is a GSS-CHANNEL-BINDINGS
   structure [RFC5554].

   The initiator-address-type and acceptor-address-type fields of the
   GSS-CHANNEL-BINDINGS structure MUST be set to 0.  The initiator-
   address and acceptor-address fields MUST be the empty string.

   The application-data field MUST be set to the gs2-header concatenated
   with, when a gs2-cb-flag of "p" is used, the application's channel
   binding data.

5.2.  Default Channel Binding

   A default channel binding type agreement process for all SASL
   application protocols that do not provide their own channel binding
   type agreement is provided as follows.

   'tls-unique' is the default channel binding type for any application
   that doesn't specify one.

   Servers MUST implement the "tls-unique" [tls-unique]
   [I-D.altman-tls-channel-bindings] channel binding type, if they

   implement any channel binding.  Clients SHOULD implement the "tls-
   unique" channel binding type, if they implement any channel binding.
   Clients and servers SHOULD choose the highest-layer/innermost end-to-
   end TLS channel as the channel to bind to.

   Servers MUST choose the channel binding type indicated by the client,
   or fail authentication if they don't support it.

         S: Send reply context token as is
         ...

   GSS-API authentication is always initiated by the client.  The SASL
   framework allows either the client and server to initiate
   authentication.  In GS2 the server will send an initial empty
   challenge (zero byte string) if it has not yet received a token from
   the client.  See section 3 of [RFC4422].


7.  Authentication Conditions

   Authentication MUST NOT succeed if any one of the following



Josefsson & Williams      Expires July 13, 2010                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                 SASL GS2-*                   January 2010


   conditions are true:

   o  GSS_Init/Accept_sec_context return anything other than
      GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED or GSS_S_COMPLETE.
   o  If the client's initial GS2 header does not match the ABNF.
   o  In particular, if the initial character of the client message is
      anything except "F", "p", "n", or "y".
   o  If the client's GS2 channel binding flag was "y" and the server
      supports channel bindings.
   o  If the client's GS2 channel binding flag was "p" and the server
      does not support the indicated channel binding.
   o  If the client requires use of channel binding and the server did
      not advertise support for channel binding.
   o  Authorization of client principal (i.e., src_name in
      GSS_Accept_sec_context) to requested authzid failed.
   o  If the client is not authorized to the requested authzid or an
      authzid could not be derived from the client's initiator principal
      name.


8.  GSS-API Parameters

   GS2 does not use any GSS-API per-message tokens.  Therefore the per-
   message token ret_flags from GSS_Init_sec_context() and
   GSS_Accept_sec_context() are irrelevant; implementations SHOULD NOT
   set the per-message req_flags.

   The mutual_req_flag MUST be set.  If channel binding is used then the
   client MUST check that the corresponding ret_flag is set when the
   context is fully establish, else authentication MUST fail.

   Use or non-use of deleg_req_flag and anon_req_flag is an
   implementation-specific detail.  SASL and GS2 implementors are
   encouraged to provide programming interfaces by which clients may
   choose to delegate credentials and by which servers may receive them.
   SASL and GS2 implementors are encouraged to provide programming
   interfaces which provide a good mapping of GSS-API naming options.


9.  Naming

   There's no requirement that any particular GSS-API name-types be
   used.  However, typically SASL servers will have host-based acceptor
   principal names (see [RFC2743] section 4.1) and clients will
   typically have username initiator principal names (see [RFC2743]
   section 4.2).  When a host-based acceptor principal name is used
   ("service@hostname"), "service" is the service name specified in the
   protocol's profile, and "hostname" is the fully qualified host name

10.  GSS_Inquire_SASLname_for_mech call

   We specify a new GSS-API utility function to allow SASL
   implementations to more efficiently identify the GSS-API mechanism
   that a particular SASL mechanism name refers to.

      Inputs:

      o desired_mech OBJECT IDENTIFIER

      Outputs:

      o sasl_mech_name UTF-8 STRING -- SASL name for this
        mechanism; caller must release with
        GSS_Release_buffer()

      o mech_name UTF-8 STRING -- name of this mechanism, possibly
        localized; caller must release with GSS_Release_buffer()

      o mech_description UTF-8 STRING -- possibly localized
        description of this mechanism; caller must release with
        GSS_Release_buffer()

      Return major_status codes:

      o  GSS_S_COMPLETE indicates successful completion, and that
         output parameters holds correct information.

      o  GSS_S_BAD_MECH indicates that a desired_mech was unsupported
         by the GSS-API implementation.

      The GSS_Inquire_SASLname_for_mech call is used to get the SASL
      mechanism name for a GSS-API mechanism.  It also returns a name
      and description of the mechanism in user friendly form.

      The output variable sasl_mech_name will hold the IANA registered
      mechanism name for the GSS-API mechanism, or if none is
      registered, a mechanism name computed from the OID as described
      in section 3.1 of this document.

12.  Security Layers

   GS2 does not support SASL security layers.  Applications that need
   integrity or confidentiality protection can use either channel
   binding to a secure external channel or another SASL mechanism that
   does provide security layers.


13.  Interoperability with the SASL GSSAPI mechanism

   The Kerberos V5 GSS-API [RFC1964] mechanism is currently used in SASL
   under the name GSSAPI, see GSSAPI mechanism [RFC4752].  The Kerberos
   V5 mechanism may also be used with the GS2 family.  This causes an
   interoperability problem, which is discussed and resolved below.

13.1.  The interoperability problem

   The SASL "GSSAPI" mechanism is not wire-compatible with the Kerberos
   V GSS-API mechanism used as a SASL GS2 mechanism.




Josefsson & Williams      Expires July 13, 2010                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft                 SASL GS2-*                   January 2010


   If a client (or server) only support Kerberos V5 under the "GSSAPI"
   name and the server (or client) only support Kerberos V5 under the
   GS2 family, the mechanism negotiation will fail.

13.2.  Resolving the problem

   If the Kerberos V5 mechanism is supported under GS2 in a server, the
   server SHOULD also support Kerberos V5 through the "GSSAPI"
   mechanism, to avoid interoperability problems with older clients.

   Reasons for violating this recommendation may include security
   considerations regarding the absent features in the GS2 mechanism.
   The SASL "GSSAPI" mechanism lacks support for channel bindings, which
   means that using an external secure channel may not be sufficient
   protection against active attackers (see [RFC5056], [mitm]).

13.3.  Additional Recommendations

   If the application requires SASL security layers then it MUST use the
   SASL "GSSAPI" mechanism [RFC4752] instead of "GS2-KRB5" or "GS2-KRB5-
   PLUS".

   If the application can use channel binding to an external channel
   then it is RECOMMENDED that it select Kerberos V5 through the GS2
   mechanism rather than the "GSSAPI" mechanism.


14.  GSS-API Mechanisms that negotiate other mechanisms

   A GSS-API mechanism that negotiates other mechanisms will interact
   badly with the SASL mechanism negotiation.  There are two problems.
   The first is an interoperability problem and the second is a security
   concern.  The problems are described and resolved below.

14.1.  The interoperability problem

   If a client implements GSS-API mechanism X, potentially negotiated
   through a GSS-API mechanism Y, and the server also implements GSS-API
   mechanism X negotiated through a GSS-API mechanism Z, the
   authentication negotiation will fail.

14.2.  Security problem

   If a client's policy is to first prefer GSSAPI mechanism X, then non-
   GSSAPI mechanism Y, then GSSAPI mechanism Z, and if a server supports
   mechanisms Y and Z but not X, then if the client attempts to
   negotiate mechanism X by using a GSS-API mechanism that negotiates
   other mechanisms (such as SPNEGO [RFC4178]), it may end up using

   mechanism Z when it ideally should have used mechanism Y. For this
   reason, the use of GSS-API mechanisms that negotiate other mechanisms
   is disallowed under GS2.

14.3.  Resolving the problems

   GSS-API mechanisms that negotiate other mechanisms MUST NOT be used
   with the GS2 SASL mechanism.  Specifically SPNEGO [RFC4178] MUST NOT
   be used as a GS2 mechanism.  To make this easier for SASL
   implementations we assign a symbolic SASL mechanism name to the
   SPNEGO GSS-API mechanism: "SPNEGO".  SASL client implementations MUST
   NOT choose the SPNEGO mechanism under any circumstances.

   The GSS_C_MA_MECH_NEGO attribute of GSS_Inquire_attrs_for_mech
   [RFC5587] can be used to identify such mechanisms.


15.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is advised to register a SASL mechanism family as per
   [RFC4422] using the following information.

     Subject: Registration of SASL mechanism family GS2-*
     SASL mechanism prefix: GS2-
     Security considerations: RFC [THIS-DOC]
     Published specification: RFC [THIS-DOC]
     Person & email address to contact for further information:
       Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>
     Intended usage: COMMON
     Owner/Change controller: iesg@ietf.org
     Note: Compare with the GSSAPI and GSS-SPNEGO mechanisms.

   The IANA is advised that SASL mechanism names starting with "GS2-"
   are reserved for SASL mechanisms which conform to this document.  The
   IANA is directed to place a statement to that effect in the sasl-
   mechanisms registry.

   The IANA is further advised that GS2 SASL mechanism names MUST NOT
   end in "-PLUS" except as a version of another mechanism name simply
   suffixed with "-PLUS".

   The SASL names for the Kerberos V5 GSS-API mechanism [RFC4121]
   [RFC1964] used via GS2 SHALL be "GS2-KRB5" and "GS2-KRB5-PLUS".

   The SASL names for the SPNEGO GSS-API mechanism used via GS2 SHALL be
   "SPNEGO" and "SPNEGO-PLUS".  As described in Section 14 the SASL
   "SPNEGO" and "SPNEGO-PLUS" MUST NOT be used.  These names are
   provided as a convenience for SASL library implementors.

16.  Security Considerations

   Security issues are also discussed throughout this memo.

   The security provided by a GS2 mechanism depends on the security of
   the GSS-API mechanism.  The GS2 mechanism family depends on channel
   binding support, so GSS-API mechanisms that do not support channel
   binding cannot be successfully used as SASL mechanisms via the GS2
   bridge.

   Because GS2 does not support security layers it is strongly
   RECOMMENDED that channel binding to a secure external channel be
   used.  Successful channel binding eliminates the possibility of man-
   in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, provided that the external channel and
   its channel binding data are secure and provided that the GSS-API
   mechanism used is secure.  Authentication failure because of channel
   binding failure may indicate that an MITM attack was attempted, but
   note that a real MITM attacker would likely attempt to close the
   connection to the client or simulate network partition , thus MITM
   attack detection is heuristic.

   Use of channel binding will also protect the SASL mechanism
   negotiation -- if there is no MITM then the external secure channel
   will have protected the SASL mechanism negotiation.

   The channel binding data MAY be sent (but the actual GSS-API
   mechanism used) without confidentiality protection and knowledge of
   it is assumed to provide no advantage to an MITM (who can, in any
   case, compute the channel binding data independently).  If the
   external channel does not provide confidentiality protection and the
   GSS-API mechanism does not provide confidentiality protection for the
   channel binding data, then passive attackers (eavesdroppers) can
   recover the channel binding data.  See [RFC5056].

   When constructing the input_name_string for GSS_Import_name with the
   GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE name type, the client SHOULD NOT
   canonicalize the server's fully qualified domain name using an
   insecure or untrusted directory service, such as the Domain Name
   System [RFC1034] without DNSSEC [RFC4033].

   SHA-1 is used to derive SASL mechanism names, but no traditional
   cryptographic properties are required -- the required property is
   that the truncated output for distinct inputs are different for
   practical input values.  GS2 does not use any other cryptographic
   algorithm.  Therefor GS2 is "algorithm agile", or, as agile as the
   GSS-API mechanisms that are available for use in SASL applications

   GS2 does not protect against downgrade attacks of channel binding
   types.  The complexities of negotiation a channel binding type, and
   handling down-grade attacks in that negotiation, was intentionally
   left out of scope for this document.

   The security considerations of SASL [RFC4422], the GSS-API [RFC2743],
   channel binding [RFC5056], any external channels (such as TLS,
   [RFC5246], channel binding types (see the IANA channel binding type
   registry), and GSS-API mechanisms (such as the Kerberos V5 mechanism
   [RFC4121] [RFC1964]), also apply.


17.  Acknowledgements

   The history of GS2 can be traced to the "GSSAPI" mechanism originally
   specified by RFC2222.  This document was derived from
   draft-ietf-sasl-gssapi-02 which was prepared by Alexey Melnikov with
   significant contributions from John G. Myers, although the majority
   of this document has been rewritten by the current authors.

   Contributions of many members of the SASL mailing list are gratefully
   acknowledged.  In particular, ideas and feedback from Pasi Eronen,
   Sam Hartman, Jeffrey Hutzelman, Alexey Melnikov, and Tom Yu improved
   the document and the protocol.  Other suggestions to the documents
   were made by Spencer Dawkins, Ralph Droms, Adrian Farrel, Robert
   Sparks, and Glen Zorn.

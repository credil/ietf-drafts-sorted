      <t>This memo describes a detailed framework for composing and
      aggregating metrics (both in time and in space) originally defined by
      the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) RFC 2330 and developed by the IETF.
      This new framework memo describes the generic composition and
      aggregation mechanisms. The memo provides a basis for additional
      documents that implement the framework to define detailed compositions
      and aggregations of metrics which are useful in practice.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The IPPM framework <xref target="RFC2330"></xref> describes two forms
      of metric composition, spatial and temporal. The text also suggests that
      the concepts of the analytical framework (or A-frame) would help to
      develop useful relationships to derive the composed metrics from real
      metrics. The effectiveness of composed metrics is dependent on their
      usefulness in analysis and applicability to practical measurement
      circumstances.</t>

      <t>This memo expands on the notion of composition, and provides a
      detailed framework for several classes of metrics that were described in
      the original IPPM framework. The classes include temporal aggregation,
      spatial aggregation, and spatial composition.</t>

      <section title="Motivation">
        <t>Network operators have deployed measurement systems to serve many
        purposes, including performance monitoring, maintenance support,
        network engineering, and reporting performance to customers. The
        collection of elementary measurements alone is not enough to
        understand a network's behaviour. In general, measurements need to be
        post-processed to present the most relevant information for each
        purpose. The first step is often a process of "composition" of single
        measurements or measurement sets into other forms. Composition and
        aggregation present several more post-processing opportunities to the
        network operator, and we describe the key motivations below.</t>

        <section title="Reducing Measurement Overhead">
          <t>A network's measurement possibilities scale upward with the
          square of the number of nodes. But each measurement implies
          overhead, in terms of the storage for the results, the traffic on
          the network (assuming active methods), and the operation and
          administration of the measurement system itself. In a large network,
          it is impossible to perform measurements from each node to all
          others.</t>

          <t>An individual network operator should be able to organize their
          measurement paths along the lines of physical topology, or routing
          areas/Autonomous Systems, and thus minimize dependencies and overlap
          between different measurement paths. This way, the sheer number of
          measurements can be reduced, as long as the operator has a set of
          methods to estimate performance between any particular pair of nodes
          when needed.</t>

          <t>Composition and aggregation play a key role when the path of
          interest spans multiple networks, and where each operator conducts
          their own measurements. Here, the complete path performance may be
          estimated from measurements on the component parts.</t>

          <t>Operators that take advantage of the composition and aggregation
          methods recognize that the estimates may exhibit some additional
          error beyond that inherent in the measurements themselves, and so
          they are making a trade-off to achieve reasonable measurement system
          overhead.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Measurement Re-use">
          <t>There are many different measurement users, each bringing
          specific requirements for the reporting timescale. Network managers
          and maintenance forces prefer to see results presented very rapidly,
          to detect problems quickly or see if their action has corrected a
          problem. On the other hand, network capacity planners and even
          network users sometimes prefer a long-term view of performance, for
          example to check trends. How can one set of measurements serve both
          needs?</t>

          <t>The answer lies in temporal aggregation, where the short-term
          measurements needed by the operations community are combined to
          estimate a longer-term result for others. Also, problems with the
          measurement system itself may be isolated to one or more of the
          short-term measurements, rather than possibly invalidating an entire
          long-term measurement if the problem was undetected.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Data Reduction and Consolidation">
          <t>Another motivation is data reduction. Assume there is a network
          in which delay measurements are performed among a subset of its
          nodes. A network manager might ask whether there is a problem with
          the network delay in general. It would be desirable to obtain a
          single value that gives an indication of the overall network delay.
          Spatial aggregation methods would address this need, and can produce
          the desired "single figure of merit" asked for, one that may also be
          useful in trend analysis.</t>

          <t>The overall value would be calculated from the elementary delay
          measurements, but it not obvious how: for example, it may not to be
          reasonable to average all delay measurements, as some paths (e.g.
          having a higher bandwidth or more important customers) might be
          considered more critical than others.</t>

          <t>Metric composition can help to provide, from raw measurement
          data, some tangible, well-understood and agreed upon information
          about the service guarantees provided by a network. Such information
          can be used in the Service Level Agreement/Service Level
          Specification (SLA/SLS) contracts between a service provider and its
          customers.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Implications on Measurement Design and Reporting">
          <t>If a network measurement system operator anticipates needing to
          produce overall metrics by composition, then it is prudent to keep
          that requirement in mind when considering the measurement design and
          sampling plan. Also, certain summary statistics are more conducive
          to composition than others, and this figures prominently in the
          design of measurements and when reporting the results.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Purpose and Scope">
      <t>The purpose of this memo is provide a common framework for the
      various classes of metrics that are composed from primary metrics. The
      scope is limited to the definitions of metrics that are composed from
      primary metrics using a deterministic function. Key information about
      each composed metric, such as the assumptions under which the
      relationship holds and possible sources of error/circumstances where the
      composition may fail, are included.</t>

      <t>At this time, the scope of effort is limited to composed metrics for
      packet loss, delay, and delay variation, as defined in <xref
      target="RFC2679"></xref>, <xref target="RFC2680"></xref>, <xref
      target="RFC2681"></xref>, <xref target="RFC3393"></xref>, <xref
      target="RFC5481"></xref>, and the comparable metrics in <xref
      target="Y.1540"></xref> . Composition of packet reordering metrics <xref
      target="RFC4737"></xref> and duplication metrics <xref
      target="RFC5560"></xref> are considered research topics at the time this
      memo was prepared, and beyond its scope.</t>

      <t>This memo will retain the terminology of the IPPM Framework <xref
      target="RFC2330"></xref>as much as possible, but will extend the
      terminology when necessary. It is assumed that the reader is familiar
      with the concepts introduced in <xref target="RFC2330"></xref>, as they
      will not be repeated here.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This section defines the terminology applicable to the processes of
      Metric Composition and Aggregation.</t>

      <section title="Measurement Point">
        <t>The logical or physical location where packet observations are
        made. The term Measurement Point is synonymous with the term
        "observation position" used in <xref target="RFC2330"></xref> when
        describing the notion of wire time. A measurement point may be at the
        boundary between a host and an adjacent link (physical), or it may be
        within a host (logical) that performs measurements where the
        difference between host time and wire time is understood.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Complete Path">
        <t>The complete path is the actual path that a packet would follow as
        it travels from the packet&rsquo;s Source to its Destination. A
        Complete path may span the administrative boundaries of one or more
        networks.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Complete Path Metric">
        <t>The complete path metric is the Source to Destination metric that a
        composed metric attempts to estimate. A complete path metric
        represents the ground-truth for a composed metric.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Complete Time Interval">
        <t>The complete time interval is comprised of two or more contiguous
        sub-intervals, and is the interval whose performance will be estimated
        through temporal aggregation.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Composed Metric">
        <t>A composed metric is an estimate of an actual metric describing the
        performance of a path over some time interval. A composed metric is
        derived from other metrics by applying a deterministic process or
        function (e.g., a composition function). The process may use metrics
        that are identical to the metric being composed, or metrics that are
        dissimilar, or some combination of both types.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Composition Function">
        <t>A composition function is a deterministic process applied to
        individual metrics to derive another metric (such as a Composed
        metric).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Ground Truth">
        <t>As applied here, the notion of ground truth is defined as the
        actual performance of a network path over some time interval. The
        ground truth is a metric on the (unavailable) packet transfer
        information for the desired path and time interval that a composed
        metric seeks to estimate.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Interval">
        <t>A span of time.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Sub-interval">
        <t>A Sub-interval is a time interval that is included in another
        interval.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Sub-path">
        <t>A Sub-path is a portion of the complete path where at least the
        Sub-path Source and Destination hosts are constituents of the complete
        path. We say that such a sub-path is &ldquo;involved&rdquo; in the
        complete path.</t>

        <t>Since sub-paths terminate on hosts, it is important to describe how
        sub-paths are considered to be joined. In practice, the Source and
        Destination hosts may perform the function of measurement points.</t>

        <t>If the Destination and Source hosts of two adjoining paths are
        co-located and the link between them would contribute negligible
        performance, then these hosts can be considered equivalent (even if
        there is no physical link between them, this is a practical
        concession).</t>

        <t>If the Destination and Source hosts of two adjoining paths have a
        link between them that contributes to the complete path performance,
        then the link and hosts constitutes another sub-path that is involved
        in the complete path, and should be characterized and included in the
        composed metric.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Sub-path Metrics">
        <t>A sub-path path metric is an element of the process to derive a
        Composite metric, quantifying some aspect of the performance a
        particular sub-path from its Source to Destination.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Description of Metric Types ">
      <t>This section defines the various classes of Composition. There are
      two classes more accurately described as aggregation over time and
      space, and the third involves concatenation in space.</t>

      <section title="Temporal Aggregation Description">
        <t>Aggregation in time is defined as the composition of metrics with
        the same type and scope obtained in different time instants or time
        windows. For example, starting from a time series of the measurements
        of maximum and minimum One-Way Delay on a certain network path
        obtained over 5-minute intervals, we obtain a time series measurement
        with a coarser resolution (60 minutes) by taking the maximum of 12
        consecutive 5-minute maxima and the minimum of 12 consecutive 5-minute
        minima.</t>

        <t>The main reason for doing time aggregation is to reduce the amount
        of data that has to be stored, and make the visualization/spotting of
        regular cycles and/or growing or decreasing trends easier. Another
        useful application is to detect anomalies or abnormal changes in the
        network characteristics.</t>

        <t>In RFC 2330, the term "temporal composition" is introduced and
        differs from temporal aggregation in that it refers to methodologies
        to predict future metrics on the basis of past observations (of the
        same metrics), exploiting the time correlation that certain metrics
        can exhibit. We do not consider this type of composition here.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Spatial Aggregation Description">
        <t>Aggregation in space is defined as the combination of metrics of
        the same type and different scope, in order to estimate the overall
        performance of a larger network. This combination may involve weighing
        the contributions of the input metrics.</t>

        <t>Suppose we want to compose the average One-Way-Delay (OWD)
        experienced by flows traversing all the Origin-Destination (OD) pairs
        of a network (where the inputs are already metric "statistics"). Since
        we wish to include the effect of the traffic matrix on the result, it
        makes sense to weight each metric according to the traffic carried on
        the corresponding OD pair:</t>

        <t>OWD_sum=f1*OWD_1+f2*OWD_2+...+fn*OWD_n</t>

        <t>where fi=load_OD_i/total_load.</t>

        <t>A simple average OWD across all network OD pairs would not use the
        traffic weighting.</t>

        <t>Another example metric that is "aggregated in space", is the
        maximum edge-to-edge delay across a single network. Assume that a
        Service Provider wants to advertise the maximum delay that transit
        traffic will experience while passing through his/her network. There
        can be multiple edge-to-edge paths across a network, and the Service
        Provider chooses either to publish a list of delays (each
        corresponding to a specific edge-to-edge path), or publish a single
        maximum value. The latter approach simplifies the publication of
        measurement information, and may be sufficient for some purposes.
        Similar operations can be provided to other metrics, e.g. "maximum
        edge-to-edge packet loss", etc.</t>

        <t>We suggest that space aggregation is generally useful to obtain a
        summary view of the behaviour of large network portions, or in general
        of coarser aggregates. The metric collection time instant, i.e. the
        metric collection time window of measured metrics is not considered in
        space aggregation. We assume that either it is consistent for all the
        composed metrics, e.g. compose a set of average delays all referred to
        the same time window, or the time window of each composed metric does
        not affect aggregated metric.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Spatial Composition Description">
        <t>Concatenation in space is defined as the composition of metrics of
        same type and (ideally) different spatial scope, so that the resulting
        metric is representative of what the metric would be if obtained with
        a direct measurement over the sequence of the several spatial scopes.
        An example is the sum of OWDs of different edge-to-edge network's
        delays, where the intermediate edge points are close to each other or
        happen to be the same. In this way, we can for example estimate OWD_AC
        starting from the knowledge of OWD_AB and OWD_BC. Note that there may
        be small gaps in measurement coverage, likewise there may be small
        overlaps (e.g., the link where test equipment connects to the
        network).</t>

        <t>One key difference from examples of aggregation in space is that
        all sub-paths contribute equally to the composed metric, independent
        of the traffic load present.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Help Metrics">
        <t>In practice there is often the need to compute a new metric using
        one or more metrics with the same spatial and time scope. For example,
        the metric rtt_sample_variance may be computed from two different
        metrics: the help metrics rtt_square_sum and the rtt_sum. The process
        of using help metrics is a simple calculation and not an aggregation
        or a concatenation, and will not be investigated further in this
        memo.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Higher Order Composition">
        <t>Composed metrics might themselves be subject to further steps of
        composition or aggregation. An example would be the delay of a maximal
        path obtained through the spatial composition of several composed
        delays for each Complete Path in the maximal path (obtained through
        spatial composition). All requirements for first order composition
        metrics apply to higher order composition.</t>

        <t>An example using temporal aggregation: twelve 5-minute metrics are
        aggregated to estimate the performance over an hour. The second step
        of aggregation would take 24 hourly metrics and estimate the
        performance over a day.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements for Composed Metrics">
      <t>The definitions for all composed metrics MUST include sections to
      treat the following topics.</t>

      <t>The description of each metric will clearly state: <list
          style="numbers">
          <t>the definition (and statistic, where appropriate);</t>

          <t>the composition or aggregation relationship;</t>

          <t>the specific conjecture on which the relationship is based and
          assumptions of the statistical model of the process being measured,
          if any (see <xref target="RFC2330"></xref> section 12);</t>

          <t>a justification of practical utility or usefulness for analysis
          using the A-frame concepts;</t>

          <t>one or more examples of how the conjecture could be incorrect and
          lead to inaccuracy;</t>

          <t>the information to be reported.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>For each metric, the applicable circumstances will be defined, in
      terms of whether the composition or aggregation: <list style="symbols">
          <t>Requires homogeneity of measurement methodologies, or can allow a
          degree of flexibility (e.g., active or passive methods produce the
          "same" metric). Also, the applicable sending streams will be
          specified, such as Poisson, Periodic, or both.</t>

          <t>Needs information or access that will only be available within an
          operator's network, or is applicable to Inter-network
          composition.</t>

          <t>Requires precisely synchronized measurement time intervals in all
          component metrics, or loosely synchronized, or no timing
          requirements.</t>

          <t>Requires assumption of component metric independence w.r.t. the
          metric being defined/composed, or other assumptions.</t>

          <t>Has known sources of inaccuracy/error, and identifies the
          sources.</t>
        </list></t>

        <t>The Composed Metric is an estimate of an actual metric collected
        over the complete Source to Destination path. We say that the Complete
        Path Metric represents the "Ground Truth" for the Composed Metric. In
        other words, Composed Metrics seek to minimize error w.r.t. the
        Complete Path Metric.</t>

        <t>Further, we observe that a Spatial Metric <xref
        target="RFC5644"></xref> collected for packets traveling over the same
        set of sub-paths provide a basis for the Ground Truth of the
        individual Sub-Path metrics. We note that mathematical operations may
        be necessary to isolate the performance of each sub-path.</t>

        <t>Next, we consider multiparty metrics as defined in <xref
        target="RFC5644"></xref>, and their spatial composition. Measurements
        to each of the Receivers produce an element of the one-to-group
        metric. These elements can be composed from sub-path metrics and the
        composed metrics can be combined to create a composed one-to-group
        metric. Figure 2 illustrates this process.</t>

        <t>Here, Sub-path Metrics M1, M2, and M3 are combined using a
        relationship to compose the metric applicable to the Src-Rcvr1 path.
        Similarly, M1, M4, and M5 are used to compose the Src-Rcvr2 metric and
        M1, M4, and M6 compose the Src-Rcvr3 metric.</t>

        <t>The Composed One-to-Group Metric would list the Src-Rcvr metrics
        for each Receiver in the Group:</t>

        <t>(Composed-Rcvr1, Composed-Rcvr2, Composed-Rcvr3)</t>

        <t>The "Ground Truth" for this composed metric is of course an actual
        One-to-Group metric, where a single source packet has been measured
        after traversing the Complete Paths to the various receivers.</t>

        <section title="Ground Truth for Temporal Aggregation">
          <t>Temporal Aggregation involves measurements made over
          sub-intervals of the complete time interval between the same Source
          and Destination. Therefore, the "Ground Truth" is the metric
          measured over the desired interval.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Ground Truth for Spatial Aggregation">
          <t>Spatial Aggregation combines many measurements using a weighting
          function to provide the same emphasis as though the measurements
          were based on actual traffic, with inherent weights. Therefore, the
          "Ground Truth" is the metric measured on the actual traffic instead
          of the active streams that sample the performance.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Deviation from the Ground Truth">
        <t>A metric composition can deviate from the ground truth for several
        reasons. Two main aspects are:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The propagation of the inaccuracies of the underlying
            measurements when composing the metric. As part of the composition
            function, errors of measurements might propagate. Where possible,
            this analysis should be made and included with the description of
            each metric.</t>

            <t>A difference in scope. When concatenating many active
            measurement results (from two or more sub-paths) to obtain the
            complete path metric, the actual measured path will not be
            identical to the complete path. It is in general difficult to
            quantify this deviation with exactness, but a metric definition
            might identify guidelines for keeping the deviation as small as
            possible.</t>
          </list> The description of the metric composition MUST include an
        section identifying the deviation from the ground truth.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Incomplete Information">
        <t>In practice, when measurements cannot be initiated on a sub-path or
        during a particular measurement interval (and perhaps the measurement
        system gives up during the test interval), then there will not be a
        value for the sub-path reported, and the result SHOULD be recorded as
        "undefined".</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Time Varying Metrics">
        <t>The measured values of many metrics depend on time-variant factors,
        such as the level of network traffic on the source to destination
        path. Traffic levels often exhibit diurnal (or daily) variation, but a
        24 hour measurement interval would obscure it. Temporal Aggregation of
        hourly results to estimate the daily metric would have the same
        effect, and so the same cautions are warranted.</t>

        <t>Some metrics are predominantly* time-invariant, such as the actual
        minimum one-way delay of fixed path, and therefore temporal
        aggregation does not obscure the results as long as the path is
        stable. However, paths do vary, and sometimes on less predictable time
        intervals than traffic variations. (* Note - It is recognized that
        propagation delay on transmission facilities may have diurnal,
        seasonal, and even longer-term variations.)</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
      live networks are relevant here as well. See <xref

      <t>The exchange of sub-path measurements among network providers may be
      a source of concern, and the information should be sufficiently
      anonymized to avoid revealing unnecessary operational details (e.g., the
      network addresses of measurement devices). However, the schema for
      measurement exchange is beyond the scope of this memo, and likely to be
      covered by bilateral agreements for some time to come.</t>

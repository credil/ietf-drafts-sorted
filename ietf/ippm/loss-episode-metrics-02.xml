      <t>This memo describes a framework for composing and aggregating metrics
      (both in time and in space) defined by RFC 2330 and developed by the
      IPPM working group. The framework describes the generic composition and
      aggregation mechanisms. It provides a basis for additional documents
      that implement this framework for detailed, and practically useful,
      compositions and aggregations of metrics.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The IPPM framework <xref target="RFC2330"></xref> describes two forms
      of metric composition, spatial and temporal. Also, the text suggests
      that the concepts of the analytical framework (or A-frame) would help to
      develop useful relationships to derive the composed metrics from real
      metrics. The effectiveness of composed metrics is dependent on their
      usefulness in analysis and applicability to practical measurement
      circumstances.</t>

      <t>This memo expands on the notion of composition, and provides a
      detailed framework for several classes of metrics that were mentioned in
      the original IPPM framework. The classes include temporal aggregation,
      spatial aggregation, and spatial composition.</t>

      <section title="Motivation">
        <t>Network operators have deployed measurement systems to serve many
        purposes, including performance monitoring, maintenance support,
        network engineering, and customer reporting. The collection of
        elementary measurements alone is not enough to understand a network's
        behaviour. In general, measurements need to be post-processed to
        present the most relevant information for each purpose. The first step
        is often a process of "composition" of single measurements or
        measurement sets into other forms. Composition and aggregation present
        several more post-processing opportunities to the network operator,
        and we describe the key motivations below.</t>

        <section title="Reducing Measurement Overhead">
          <t>A network's measurement possibilities scale upward with the
          square of the number of nodes. But each measurement implies
          overhead, in terms of the storage for the results, the traffic on
          the network (assuming active methods), and the OA&amp;M for the
          measurement system itself. In a large network, it is impossible to
          perform measurements from each node to all others.</t>

          <t>An individual network operator should be able to organize their
          measurement paths along the lines of physical topology, or routing
          areas/Autonomous Systems, and thus minimize dependencies and overlap
          between different measurement paths. This way, the sheer number of
          measurements can be reduced, as long as the operator has a set of
          methods to estimate performance between any particular nodes when
          needed.</t>

          <t>Composition and aggregation play a key role when the path of
          interest spans multiple networks, and where each operator conducts
          their own measurements. Here, the complete path performance may be
          estimated from measurements on the component parts.</t>

          <t>Operators that take advantage of the composition and aggregation
          methods recognize that the estimates may exhibit some additional
          error beyond that inherent in the measurements themselves, and so
          they are making a trade-off to achieve reasonable measurement system
          overhead.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Measurement Re-use">
          <t>There are many different measurement users, each bringing
          specific requirements for the reporting timescale. Network managers
          and maintenance forces prefer to see results presented very rapidly,
          to detect problems quickly or see if their action has corrected a
          problem. On the other hand, network capacity planners and even
          network users sometimes prefer a long-term view of performance, for
          example to check trends. How can one set of measurements serve both
          needs?</t>

          <t>The answer lies in temporal aggregation, where the short-term
          measurements needed by the operations community are combined to
          estimate a longer-term result for others. Also, problems with the
          measurement system itself may be isolated to one or more of the
          short-term measurements, rather than possibly invalidating an entire
          long-term measurement if the problem was undetected.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Data Reduction and Consolidation">
          <t>Another motivation is data reduction. Assume there is a network
          domain in which delay measurements are performed among a subset of
          its nodes. A network manager might ask whether there is a problem
          with the network delay in general. It would be desirable to obtain a
          single value that gives an indication of the overall network delay.
          Spatial aggregation methods would address this need, and can produce
          the desired "single figure of merit" asked for, one that may also be
          useful in trend analysis.</t>

          <t>The overall value would be calculated from the elementary delay
          measurements, but it not obvious how: for example, it may not to be
          reasonable to average all delay measurements, as some paths (e.g.
          having a higher bandwidth or more important customers) might be
          considered more critical than others.</t>

          <t>Metric composition can help to provide, from raw measurement
          data, some tangible, well-understood and agreed upon information
          about the service guarantees provided by a network. Such information
          can be used in the Service Level Agreement/Service Level
          Specification (SLA/SLS) contracts between a service provider and its
          customers.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Implications on Measurement Design and Reporting">
          <t>If a network operator can anticipate needing to aggregate or
          compose overall metrics in the future, it is more efficient to start
          by considering the tenants of these methods in the measurement
          design/sampling plan, and reporting the results. The Summary
          Statistics of certain metrics are more conducive to composition than
          others. This figures prominently in the design of measurements and
          the results reports.</t>

    <section title="Purpose and Scope">
      <t>The purpose of this memo is provide a common framework for the
      various classes of metrics based on composition of primary metrics. The
      scope is limited to the definitions of metrics that are composed from
      primary metrics using a deterministic function. Key information about
      each metric, such as its assumptions under which the relationship holds,
      and possible sources of error/circumstances where the composition may
      fail, are included.</t>

      <t>At this time, the scope of effort is limited to the metrics for
      packet loss, delay, and delay variation. Composition of packet
      reordering metrics is considered a research topic, and beyond the scope
      at the time this memo was prepared.</t>

      <t>This memo will retain the terminology of the IPPM Framework <xref
      target="RFC2330"></xref>as much as possible, but will extend the
      terminology when necessary. It is assumed that the reader is familiar
      with the concepts introduced in <xref target="RFC2330"></xref>, as they
      will not be repeated here.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This section defines the terminology applicable to the processes of
      Metric Composition and Aggregation.</t>

      <section title="Measurement Point">
        <t>The logical or physical location where packet observations are
        made. The term Measurement Point is synonymous with the term
        "observation position" used in <xref target="RFC2330"></xref> when
        describing the notion of wire time. A measurement point may be at the
        boundary between a host and an adjacent link (physical), or it may be
        within a host (logical) that performs measurements where the
        difference between host time and wire time is understood.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Complete path">
        <t>The complete path is the true path that a packet would follow as it
        traverses from the packet&rsquo;s Source to its Destination.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Complete path metric">
        <t>The complete path metric is the Source to Destination metric that a
        composed metric is estimating. A complete path metric represents the
        ground-truth for a composed metric.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Composed Metric">
        <t>A composed metric is derived from other metrics principally by
        applying a composition function.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Composition Function">
        <t>A composition function is a deterministic process applied to
        Sub-path metrics to derive another metric (such as a Composed
        metric).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Ground Truth">
        <t>As applied here, the notion of ground truth is defined as the
        actual performance of a network entity over some time interval. The
        ground truth is the (unavailable) measurement that a composed metric
        seeks to estimate.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Sub-interval">
        <t>A Sub-interval is a time interval that is included in another
        interval.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Sub-path">
        <t>A Sub-path is a portion of the complete path where at least the
        Sub-path Source and Destination hosts are constituents of the complete
        path. We say that this sub-path is &ldquo;involved&rdquo; in the
        complete path.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Sub-path metrics">
        <t>A sub-path path metric is an element of the process to derive a
        Composite metric, quantifying some aspect of the performance a
        particular sub-path from its Source to Destination.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Description of Metric Types ">
      <t>This section defines the various classes of Composition. There are
      two classes more accurately referred to as aggregation over time and
      space, and the third is simply composition in space.</t>

      <section title="Temporal Aggregation Description">
        <t>Aggregation in time is defined as the composition of metrics with
        the same type and scope obtained in different time instants or time
        windows. For example, starting from a time series of One-Way Delay
        measurements on a certain network path obtained in 5-minute periods
        and averaging groups of 12 consecutive values, we obtain a time series
        measurement with a coarser resolution (60 minutes). The main reason
        for doing time aggregation is to reduce the amount of data that has to
        be stored, and make the visualization/spotting of regular cycles
        and/or growing or decreasing trends easier. Another useful application
        is to detect anomalies or abnormal changes in the network
        characteristics.</t>

        <t>In RFC 2330, the term "temporal composition" is introduced and
        differs from temporal aggregation in that it refers to methodologies
        to predict future metrics on the basis of past observations,
        exploiting the time correlation that certain metrics can exhibit. We
        do not consider this type of composition here.</t>

        <t>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Comment: Why no forecasting? This
        was apparently a limit on the Geant2 project, but may not apply
        here.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Spatial Aggregation Description">
        <t>Aggregation in space is defined as the combination of metrics of
        the same type and different scope, in order to estimate the overall
        performance of a larger domain. This combination may involve weighing
        the contributions of the input metrics.</t>

        <t>Suppose we want to compose the average One-Way-Delay (OWD)
        experienced by flows traversing all the Origin-Destination (OD) pairs
        of a network domain (where the inputs are already metric
        "statistics"). Since we wish to include the effect of the traffic
        matrix on the result, it makes sense to weight each metric according
        to the traffic carried on the corresponding OD pair:</t>

        <t>OWD_sum=f1*OWD_1+f2*OWD_2+...+fn*OWD_n</t>

        <t>where fi=load_OD_i/total_load.</t>

        <t>A simple average OWD across all network OD pairs would not use the
        traffic weighting.</t>

        <t>Another example metric that is "aggregated in space", is the
        maximum edge-to-edge delay across a single domain. Assume that a
        Service Provider wants to advertise the maximum delay that transit
        traffic will experience while passing through his/her domain. There
        can be multiple edge-to-edge paths across a domain, and the Service
        Provider chooses either to publish a list of delays (each
        corresponding to a specific edge-to-edge path), or publish a single
        maximum value. The latter approach simplifies the publication of
        measurement information, and may be sufficient for some purposes.
        Similar operations can be provided to other metrics, e.g. "maximum
        edge-to-edge packet loss", etc.</t>

        <t>We suggest that space aggregation is generally useful to obtain a
        summary view of the behaviour of large network portions, or in general
        of coarser aggregates. The metric collection time instant, i.e. the
        metric collection time window of measured metrics is not considered in
        space aggregation. We assume that either it is consistent for all the
        composed metrics, e.g. compose a set of average delays all referred to
        the same time window, or the time window of each composed metric does
        not affect aggregated metric.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Spatial Composition Description">
        <t>Concatenation in space is defined as the composition of metrics of
        same type and (ideally) different spatial scope, so that the resulting
        metric is representative of what the metric would be if obtained with
        a direct measurement over the sequence of the several spatial scopes.
        An example is the sum of OWDs of different edge-to-edge domain's
        delays, where the intermediate edge points are close to each other or
        happen to be the same. In this way, we can for example estimate OWD_AC
        starting from the knowledge of OWD_AB and OWD_BC. Note that there may
        be small gaps in measurement coverage, likewise there may be small
        overlaps (e.g., the link where test equipment connects to the
        network).</t>

        <t>One key difference from examples of aggregation in space is that
        all sub-paths contribute equally to the composed metric, independent
        of the traffic load present.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Help Metrics">
        <t>Finally, note that in practice there is often the need of
        extracting a new metric making some computation over one or more
        metrics with the same spatial and time scope. For example, the
        composed metric rtt_sample_variance may be composed from two different
        metrics: the help metric rtt_square_sum and the statistical metric
        rtt_sum. This operation is however more a simple calculation and not
        an aggregation or a concatenation, and we'll not investigate it
        further in this memo.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Higher Order Composition">
        <t>Composed metrics might themselves be subject to further steps of
        composition or aggregation. An example would be a the delay of a
        maximal domain obtained through the spatial composition of several
        composed end-to-end delays (obtained through spatial composition). All
        requirements for first order composition metrics apply to higher order
        composition.</t>

        <t>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Comment Response: are more examples needed
        here?</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements for Composed Metrics">
      <t>The definitions for all composed metrics MUST include sections to
      treat the following topics.</t>

      <t>The description of each metric will clearly state: <list
          style="numbers">
          <t>the definition (and statistic, where appropriate);</t>

          <t>the composition or aggregation relationship;</t>

          <t>the specific conjecture on which the relationship is based;</t>

          <t>a justification of practical utility or usefulness for analysis
          using the A-frame concepts;</t>

          <t>one or more examples of how the conjecture could be incorrect and
          lead to inaccuracy;</t>

          <t>the information to be reported.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Each metric will require a relationship to determine the aggregated
      or composed metric. The relationships may involve conjecture, and
      [RFC2330] lists four points that the metric definitions should
      include:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>the specific conjecture applied to the metric,</t>

          <t>a justification of the practical utility of the composition, in
          terms of making accurate measurements of the metric on the path,</t>

          <t>a justification of the usefulness of the aggregation or
          composition in terms of making analysis of the path using A-frame
          concepts more effective, and</t>

          <t>an analysis of how the conjecture could be incorrect.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>For each metric, the applicable circumstances are defined, in terms
      of whether the composition or aggregation: <list style="symbols">
          <t>Requires homogeneity of measurement methodologies, or can allow a
          degree of flexibility (e.g., active or passive methods produce the
          "same" metric). Also, the applicable sending streams will be
          specified, such as Poisson, Periodic, or both.</t>

          <t>Needs information or access that will only be available within an
          operator's domain, or is applicable to Inter-domain composition.</t>

          <t>Requires precisely synchronized measurement time intervals in all
          component metrics, or loosely synchronized, or no timing
          requirements.</t>

          <t>Requires assumption of component metric independence w.r.t. the
          metric being defined/composed, or other assumptions.</t>

          <t>Has known sources of inaccuracy/error, and identifies the
          sources.</t>

        <t>The Composed Metric is an estimate of an actual metric collected
        over the complete Source to Destination path. We say that the Complete
        Path Metric represents the "Ground Truth" for the Composed Metric. In
        other words, Composed Metrics seek to minimize error w.r.t. the
        Complete Path Metric.</t>

        <t>Further, we observe that a Spatial Metric <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ippm-multimetrics">I-D.ietf-ippm-multimetrics</xref>collected
        for packets traveling over the same set of sub-paths provide a basis
        for the Ground Truth of the individual Sub-Path metrics. We note that
        mathematical operations may be necessary to isolate the performance of
        each sub-path.</t>

        <t>Next, we consider multiparty metrics as defined in
        [I-D.ietf-ippm-multimetrics], and their spatial composition.
        Measurements to each of the Receivers produce an element of the
        one-to-group metric. These elements can be composed from sub-path
        metrics and the composed metrics can be combined to create a composed
        one-to-group metric. Figure 2 illustrates this process.</t>

        <t>Here, Sub-path Metrics M1, M2, and M3 are combined using a
        relationship to compose the metric applicable to the Src-Rcvr1 path.
        Similarly, M1, M4, and M5 are used to compose the Src-Rcvr2 metric and
        M1, M4, and M6 compose the Src-Rcvr3 metric.</t>

        <t>The Composed One-to-Group Metric would list the Src-Rcvr metrics
        for each Receiver in the Group:</t>

        <t>(Composed-Rcvr1, Composed-Rcvr2, Composed-Rcvr3)</t>

        <t>The "Ground Truth" for this composed metric is of course an actual
        One-to-Group metric, where a single source packet has been measured
        after traversing the Complete Paths to the various receivers.</t>

        <section title="Ground Truth for Temporal Aggregation">
          <t>Temporal Aggregation involves measurements made over
          sub-intervals of the desired test interval between the same Source
          and Destination. Therefore, the "Ground Truth" is the metric
          measured over the desired interval.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Ground Truth for Spatial Aggregation">
          <t>Spatial Aggregation combines many measurements using a weighting
          function to provide the same emphasis as though the measurements
          were based on actual traffic, with inherent weights. Therefore, the
          "Ground Truth" is the metric measured on the actual traffic instead
          of the active streams that sample the performance.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Deviation from the Ground Truth">
        <t>A metric composition can deviate from the ground truth for several
        reasons. Two main aspects are:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The propagation of the inaccuracies of the underlying
            measurements when composing the metric. As part of the composition
            function, errors of measurements might propagate. Where possible,
            this analysis should be made and included with the description of
            each metric.</t>

            <t>A difference in scope. When concatenating hop-by-hop active
            measurement results to obtain the end-to-end metric, the actual
            measured path will not be identical to the end-to-end path. It is
            in general difficult to quantify this deviation, but a metric
            definition might identify guidelines for keeping the deviation as
            small as possible.</t>
          </list> The description of the metric composition MUST include an
        section identifying the deviation from the ground truth.</t>

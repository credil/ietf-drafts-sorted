      and options when seeking info that serves their needs. The memo then

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>When designing measurements of IP networks and presenting the
      results, knowledge of the audience is a key consideration. To present a
      useful and relevant portrait of network conditions, one must answer the
      following question:</t>

      <t>"How will the results be used?"</t>

      <t>There are two main audience categories:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Network Characterization - describes conditions in an IP network
          for quality assurance, troubleshooting, modeling, Service Level
          Agreements (SLA), etc. The point-of-view looks inward, toward the
          network, and the consumer intends their actions there.</t>

          <t>Application Performance Estimation - describes the network
          conditions in a way that facilitates determining affects on user
          applications, and ultimately the users themselves. This
          point-of-view looks outward, toward the user(s), accepting the
          network as-is. This consumer intends to estimate a network-dependent
          aspect of performance, or design some aspect of an application's
          accommodation of the network. (These are *not* application metrics,
          they are defined at the IP layer.)</t>
        </list>This memo considers how these different points-of-view affect
      both the measurement design (parameters and options of the metrics) and
      statistics reported when serving their needs.</t>

      <t>The IPPM framework <xref target="RFC2330"></xref> and other RFCs
      describing IPPM metrics provide a background for this memo.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Purpose and Scope">
      <t>The purpose of this memo is to clearly delineate two points-of-view
      (POV) for using measurements, and describe their effects on the test
      design, including the selection of metric parameters and reporting the
      results.</t>

      <t>The current scope of this memo primarily covers the design and
      reporting of the loss and delay metrics <xref target="RFC2680"></xref>
      <xref target="RFC2679"></xref>. It will also discuss the delay variation
      <xref target="RFC3393"></xref> and reordering metrics <xref
      target="RFC4737"></xref> where applicable.</t>

      <t>With capacity metrics growing in relevance to the industry, the memo
      also covers POV and reporting considerations for metrics resulting from
      the Bulk Transfer Capacity Framework <xref target="RFC3148"></xref> and
      Network Capacity Definitions <xref target="RFC5136"></xref>. These memos
      effectively describe two different categories of metrics, <xref
      target="RFC3148"></xref> with congestion flow-control and the notion of
      unique data bits delivered, and <xref target="RFC5136"></xref> using a
      definition of raw capacity without the restrictions of data uniqueness
      or congestion-awareness. It might seem at first glance that each of
      these metrics has an obvious audience (Raw = Network Characterization,
      Restricted = Application Performance), but reality is more complex and
      consistent with the overall topic of capacity measurement and reporting.
      For example, TCP is usually used in Restricted capacity measurement
      methods, while UDP appears in Raw capacity measurement. The Raw and
      Restricted capacity metrics will be treated in separate sections,
      although they share one common reporting issue: representing variability
      in capacity metric results.</t>

      <t>Sampling, or the design of the active packet stream that is the basis
      for the measurements, is also discussed.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Reporting Results">
      <t>This section gives an overview of recommendations, followed by
      additional considerations for reporting results in the "long-term".</t>

      <section title="Overview of Metric Statistics">
        <t>This section gives an overview of reporting recommendations for the
        loss, delay, and delay variation metrics based on the discussion and
        conclusions of the preceding sections.</t>

        <t>The minimal report on measurements MUST include both Loss and Delay
        Metrics.</t>

        <t>For Packet Loss, the loss ratio defined in <xref
        target="RFC2680"></xref> is a sufficient starting point, especially
        the guidance for setting the loss threshold waiting time. We have
        calculated a waiting time above that should be sufficient to
        differentiate between packets that are truly lost or have long finite
        delays under general measurement circumstances, 51 seconds. Knowledge
        of specific conditions can help to reduce this threshold, but 51
        seconds is considered to be manageable in practice.</t>

        <t>We note that a loss ratio calculated according to <xref
        target="Y.1540"></xref> would exclude errored packets form the
        numerator. In practice, the difference between these two loss metrics
        is small if any, depending on whether the last link prior to the
        destination contributes errored packets.</t>

        <t>For Packet Delay, we recommend providing both the mean delay and
        the median delay with lost packets designated undefined (as permitted
        by <xref target="RFC2679"></xref>). Both statistics are based on a
        conditional distribution, and the condition is packet arrival prior to
        a waiting time dT, where dT has been set to take maximum packet
        lifetimes into account, as discussed above. Using a long dT helps to
        ensure that delay distributions are not truncated.</t>

        <t>For Packet Delay Variation (PDV), the minimum delay of the
        conditional distribution should be used as the reference delay for
        computing PDV according to <xref target="Y.1540"></xref> or <xref
        target="RFC3393"></xref>. A useful value to report is a pseudo range
        of delay variation based on calculating the difference between a high
        percentile of delay and the minimum delay. For example, the 99.9%-ile
        minus the minimum will give a value that can be compared with
        objectives in <xref target="Y.1541"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Long-Term Reporting Considerations">
        <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-reporting"></xref> describes methods to
        conduct measurements and report the results on a near-immediate time
        scale (10 seconds, which we consider to be "short-term").</t>

        <t>Measurement intervals and reporting intervals need not be the same
        length. Sometimes, the user is only concerned with the performance
        levels achieved over a relatively long interval of time (e.g, days,
        weeks, or months, as opposed to 10 seconds). However, there can be
        risks involved with running a measurement continuously over a long
        period without recording intermediate results:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Temporary power failure may cause loss of all the results to
            date.</t>

            <t>Measurement system timing synchronization signals may
            experience a temporary outage, causing sub-sets of measurements to
            be in error or invalid.</t>

            <t>Maintenance may be necessary on the measurement system, or its
            connectivity to the network under test.</t>
          </list>For these and other reasons, such as <list style="symbols">
            <t>the constraint to collect measurements on intervals similar to
            user session length, or</t>

            <t>the dual-use of measurements in monitoring activities where
            results are needed on a period of a few minutes,</t>
          </list>there is value in conducting measurements on intervals that
        are much shorter than the reporting interval.</t>

        <t>There are several approaches for aggregating a series of
        measurement results over time in order to make a statement about the
        longer reporting interval. One approach requires the storage of all
        metric singletons collected throughout the reporting interval, even
        though the measurement interval stops and starts many times.</t>

        <t>Another approach is described in <xref target="RFC5835"></xref> as
        "temporal aggregation". This approach would estimate the results for
        the reporting interval based on many individual measurement interval
        statistics (results) alone. The result would ideally appear in the
        same form as though a continuous measurement was conducted. A memo to
        address the details of temporal aggregation is yet to be prepared.</t>

        <t>Yet another approach requires a numerical objective for the metric,
        and the results of each measurement interval are compared with the
        objective. Every measurement interval where the results meet the
        objective contribute to the fraction of time with performance as
        specified. When the reporting interval contains many measurement
        intervals it is possible to present the results as "metric A was less
        than or equal to objective X during Y% of time.</t>

        <t>NOTE that numerical thresholds are not set in IETF performance work
        and are explicitly excluded from the IPPM charter.</t>

        <t>In all measurement, it is important to avoid unintended
        synchronization with network events. This topic is treated in <xref
        target="RFC2330"></xref> for Poisson-distributed inter-packet time
        streams, and <xref target="RFC3432"></xref> for Periodic streams. Both
        avoid synchronization through use of random start times.</t>

        <t>There are network conditions where it is simply more useful to
        report the connectivity status of the Source-Destination path, and to
        distinguish time intervals where connectivity can be demonstrated from
        other time intervals (where connectivity does not appear to exist).
        <xref target="RFC2678"></xref> specifies a number of one-way and two
        connectivity metrics of increasing complexity. In this memo, we
        RECOMMEND that long term reporting of loss, delay, and other metrics
        be limited to time intervals where connectivity can be demonstrated,
        and other intervals be summarized as percent of time where
        connectivity does not appear to exist. We note that this same approach
        has been adopted in ITU-T Recommendation <xref target="Y.1540"></xref>
        where performance parameters are only valid during periods of service
        "availability" (evaluated according to a function based on packet
        loss, and sustained periods of loss ratio greater than a threshold are
        declared "unavailable").</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Effect of POV on the Loss Metric">
      <t>This section describes the ways in which the Loss metric can be tuned
      to reflect the preferences of the two audience categories, or different
      POV. The waiting time to declare a packet lost, or loss threshold is one
      area where there would appear to be a difference, but the ability to
      post-process the results may resolve it.</t>

      <section title="Loss Threshold">
        <t><xref target="RFC2680">RFC 2680</xref> defines the concept of a
        waiting time for packets to arrive, beyond which they are declared
        lost. The text of the RFC declines to recommend a value, instead
        saying that "good engineering, including an understanding of packet
        lifetimes, will be needed in practice." Later, in the methodology,
        they give reasons for waiting "a reasonable period of time", and
        leaving the definition of "reasonable" intentionally vague.</t>

        <section title="Network Characterization">
          <t>Practical measurement experience has shown that unusual network
          circumstances can cause long delays. One such circumstance is when
          routing loops form during IGP re-convergence following a failure or
          drastic link cost change. Packets will loop between two routers
          until new routes are installed, or until the IPv4 Time-to-Live (TTL)
          field (or the IPv6 Hop Limit) decrements to zero. Very long delays
          on the order of several seconds have been measured <xref
          target="Casner"></xref> <xref target="Cia03"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Therefore, network characterization activities prefer a long
          waiting time in order to distinguish these events from other causes
          of loss (such as packet discard at a full queue, or tail drop). This
          way, the metric design helps to distinguish more reliably between
          packets that might yet arrive, and those that are no longer
          traversing the network.</t>

          <t>It is possible to calculate a worst-case waiting time, assuming
          that a routing loop is the cause. We model the path between Source
          and Destination as a series of delays in links (t) and queues (q),
          as these two are the dominant contributors to delay. The normal path
          delay across n hops without encountering a loop, D, is<figure
              anchor="eqD" title="Normal Path Delay">
              <preamble></preamble>

              <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[           n

              <postamble></postamble>
            </figure></t>

          <t>and the time spent in the loop with L hops, is</t>

          <t><figure anchor="eqR" title="Delay due to Rotations in a Loop">
              <preamble></preamble>

              <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[      i + L-1

            </figure></t>

          <t>and where C is the number of times a packet circles the loop.</t>

          <t>If we take the delays of all links and queues as 100ms each, the
          TTL=255, the number of hops n=5 and the hops in the loop L=4,
          then</t>

          <t>D = 1.1 sec and R ~= 50 sec, and D + R ~= 51.1 seconds</t>

          <t>We note that the link delays of 100ms would span most continents,
          and a constant queue length of 100ms is also very generous. When a
          loop occurs, it is almost certain to be resolved in 10 seconds or
          less. The value calculated above is an upper limit for almost any
          realistic circumstance.</t>

          <t>A waiting time threshold parameter, dT, set consistent with this
          calculation would not truncate the delay distribution (possibly
          causing a change in its mathematical properties), because the
          packets that might arrive have been given sufficient time to
          traverse the network.</t>

          <t>It is worth noting that packets that are stored and deliberately
          forwarded at a much later time constitute a replay attack on the
          measurement system, and are beyond the scope of normal performance
          reporting.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Application Performance">
          <t>Fortunately, application performance estimation activities are
          not adversely affected by the estimated worst-case transfer time.
          Although the designer's tendency might be to set the Loss Threshold
          at a value equivalent to a particular application's threshold, this
          specific threshold can be applied when post-processing the
          measurements. A shorter waiting time can be enforced by locating
          packets with delays longer than the application's threshold, and
          re-designating such packets as lost. Thus, the measurement system
          can use a single loss threshold and support both application and
          network performance POVs simultaneously.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Errored Packet Designation">
        <t>RFC 2680 designates packets that arrive containing errors as lost
        packets. Many packets that are corrupted by bit errors are discarded
        within the network and do not reach their intended destination.</t>

        <t>This is consistent with applications that would check the payload
        integrity at higher layers, and discard the packet. However, some
        applications prefer to deal with errored payloads on their own, and
        even a corrupted payload is better than no packet at all.</t>

        <t>To address this possibility, and to make network characterization
        more complete, it is recommended to distinguish between packets that
        do not arrive (lost) and errored packets that arrive (conditionally
        lost).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Causes of Lost Packets">
        <t>Although many measurement systems use a waiting time to determine
        if a packet is lost or not, most of the waiting is in vain. The
        packets are no-longer traversing the network, and have not reached
        their destination.</t>

        <t>There are many causes of packet loss, including:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Queue drop, or discard</t>

            <t>Corruption of the IP header, or other essential header info</t>

            <t>TTL expiration (or use of a TTL value that is too small)</t>

            <t>Link or router failure</t>
          </list>After waiting sufficient time, packet loss can probably be
        attributed to one of these causes.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Summary for Loss">
        <t>Given that measurement post-processing is possible (even encouraged
        in the definitions of IPPM metrics), measurements of loss can easily
        serve both points of view:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Use a long waiting time to serve network characterization and
            revise results for specific application delay thresholds as
            needed.</t>

            <t>Distinguish between errored packets and lost packets when
            possible to aid network characterization, and combine the results
            for application performance if appropriate.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Effect of POV on the Delay Metric">
      <t>This section describes the ways in which the Delay metric can be
      tuned to reflect the preferences of the two consumer categories, or
      different POV.</t>

      <section title="Treatment of Lost Packets">
        <t>The Delay Metric <xref target="RFC2679"></xref> specifies the
        treatment of packets that do not successfully traverse the network:
        their delay is undefined.</t>

        <t>" &gt;&gt;The *Type-P-One-way-Delay* from Src to Dst at T is
        undefined (informally, infinite)&lt;&lt; means that Src sent the first
        bit of a Type-P packet to Dst at wire-time T and that Dst did not
        receive that packet."</t>

        <t>It is an accepted, but informal practice to assign infinite delay
        to lost packets. We next look at how these two different treatments
        align with the needs of measurement consumers who wish to characterize
        networks or estimate application performance. Also, we look at the way
        that lost packets have been treated in other metrics: delay variation
        and reordering.</t>

        <section title="Application Performance">
          <t>Applications need to perform different functions, dependent on
          whether or not each packet arrives within some finite tolerance. In
          other words, a receivers' packet processing takes one of two

              processes that remove headers, restore smooth delivery timing
              (as in a de-jitter buffer), restore sending order, check for
              errors in payloads, and many other operations.</t>

              <t>Packets that do not arrive when expected spawn other

              correction to replace the missing packet.</t>
            </list>So, it is important to maintain a distinction between
          packets that actually arrive, and those that do not. Therefore, it
          is preferable to leave the delay of lost packets undefined, and to
          characterize the delay distribution as a conditional distribution
          (conditioned on arrival).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Network Characterization">
          <t>In this discussion, we assume that both loss and delay metrics
          will be reported for network characterization (at least).</t>

          <t>Assume packets that do not arrive are reported as Lost, usually
          as a fraction of all sent packets. If these lost packets are
          assigned undefined delay, then network's inability to deliver them
          (in a timely way) is captured only in the loss metric when we report
          statistics on the Delay distribution conditioned on the event of
          packet arrival (within the Loss waiting time threshold). We can say
          that the Delay and Loss metrics are Orthogonal, in that they convey
          non-overlapping information about the network under test.</t>

          <t>However, if we assign infinite delay to all lost packets,
          then:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>The delay metric results are influenced both by packets that
              arrive and those that do not.</t>

              <t>The delay singleton and the loss singleton do not appear to
              be orthogonal (Delay is finite when Loss=0, Delay is infinite
              when Loss=1).</t>

              <t>The network is penalized in both the loss and delay metrics,
              effectively double-counting the lost packets.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>As further evidence of overlap, consider the Cumulative
          Distribution Function (CDF) of Delay when the value positive
          infinity is assigned to all lost packets. <xref target="CDF"></xref>

          <t>We note that a Delay CDF that is conditioned on packet arrival
          would not exhibit this apparent overlap with loss.</t>

          <t>Although infinity is a familiar mathematical concept, it is
          somewhat disconcerting to see any time-related metric reported as
          infinity, in the opinion of the authors. Questions are bound to
          arise, and tend to detract from the goal of informing the consumer
          with a performance report.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Delay Variation">
          <t><xref target="RFC3393"></xref> excludes lost packets from
          samples, effectively assigning an undefined delay to packets that do
          not arrive in a reasonable time. Section 4.1 describes this
          specification and its rationale (ipdv = inter-packet delay variation
          in the quote below).</t>

          <t>"The treatment of lost packets as having "infinite" or
          "undefined" delay complicates the derivation of statistics for ipdv.
          Specifically, when packets in the measurement sequence are lost,
          simple statistics such as sample mean cannot be computed. One
          possible approach to handling this problem is to reduce the event
          space by conditioning. That is, we consider conditional statistics;
          namely we estimate the mean ipdv (or other derivative statistic)
          conditioned on the event that selected packet pairs arrive at the
          destination (within the given timeout). While this itself is not
          without problems (what happens, for example, when every other packet
          is lost), it offers a way to make some (valid) statements about
          ipdv, at the same time avoiding events with undefined outcomes."</t>

          <t>We note that the argument above applies to all forms of packet
          delay variation that can be constructed using the "selection
          function" concept of <xref target="RFC3393"></xref>. In recent work
          the two main forms of delay variation metrics have been compared and
          the results are summarized in <xref target="RFC5481"></xref>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Reordering">
          <t><xref target="RFC4737"></xref>defines metrics that are based on
          evaluation of packet arrival order, and include a waiting time to
          declare a packet lost (to exclude them from further processing).</t>

          <t>If packets are assigned a delay value, then the reordering metric
          would declare any packets with infinite delay to be reordered,
          because their sequence numbers will surely be less than the "Next
          Expected" threshold when (or if) they arrive. But this practice
          would fail to maintain orthogonality between the reordering metric
          and the loss metric. Confusion can be avoided by designating the
          delay of non-arriving packets as undefined, and reserving delay
          values only for packets that arrive within a sufficiently long
          waiting time.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Preferred Statistics">
        <t>Today in network characterization, the sample mean is one statistic
        that is almost ubiquitously reported. It is easily computed and
        understood by virtually everyone in this audience category. Also, the
        sample is usually filtered on packet arrival, so that the mean is
        based a conditional distribution.</t>

        <t>The median is another statistic that summarizes a distribution,
        having somewhat different properties from the sample mean. The median
        is stable in distributions with a few outliers or without them.
        However, the median's stability prevents it from indicating when a
        large fraction of the distribution changes value. 50% or more values
        would need to change for the median to capture the change.</t>

        <t>Both the median and sample mean have difficulty with bimodal
        distributions. The median will reside in only one of the modes, and
        the mean may not lie in either mode range. For this and other reasons,
        additional statistics such as the minimum, maximum, and 95%-ile have
        value when summarizing a distribution.</t>

        <t>When both the sample mean and median are available, a comparison
        will sometimes be informative, because these two statistics are equal
        only when the delay distribution is perfectly symmetrical.</t>

        <t>Also, these statistics are generally useful from the Application
        Performance POV, so there is a common set that should satisfy
        audiences.</t>

        <t>Plots of the delay distribution may also be useful when
        single-value statistics indicate that new conditions are present. An
        empirically-derived probability distribution function will usually
        describe multiple modes more efficiently than any other form of
        result. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Summary for Delay">
        <t>From the perspectives of:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>application/receiver analysis, where subsequent processing
            depends on whether the packet arrives or times-out,</t>

            <t>straightforward network characterization without
            double-counting defects, and</t>

            <t>consistency with Delay variation and Reordering metric
            definitions,</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>the most efficient practice is to distinguish between truly lost
        and delayed packets with a sufficiently long waiting time, and to
        designate the delay of non-arriving packets as undefined.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Effect of POV on Raw Capacity Metrics">
      <t>This section describes the ways that raw capacity metrics can be
      tuned to reflect the preferences of the two audiences, or different
      Points-of-View (POV). Raw capacity refers to the metrics defined in
      <xref target="RFC5136"></xref> which do not include restrictions such as
      data uniqueness or flow-control response to congestion.</t>

      <t>In summary, the metrics considered are IP-layer Capacity, Utilization
      (or used capacity), and Available Capacity, for individual links and
      complete paths. These three metrics form a triad: knowing one metric
      constrains the other two (within their allowed range), and knowing two
      determines the third. The link metrics have another key aspect in
      common: they are single-measurement-point metrics at the egress of a
      link. The path Capacity and Available Capacity are derived by examining
      the set of single-point link measurements and taking the minimum
      value.</t>

      <section title="Type-P Parameter">
        <t>The concept of "packets of type-P" is defined in <xref
        target="RFC2330"></xref>. The type-P categorization has critical
        relevance in all forms of capacity measurement and reporting. The
        ability to categorize packets based on header fields for assignment to
        different queues and scheduling mechanisms is now common place. When
        un-used resources are shared across queues, the conditions in all
        packet categories will affect capacity and related measurements. This
        is one source of variability in the results that all audiences would
        prefer to see reported in a useful and easily understood way.</t>

        <t>Type-P in OWAMP and TWAMP is essentially confined to the Diffserv
        Codepoint [ref]. DSCP is the most common qualifier for type-P.</t>

        <t>Each audience will have a set of type-P qualifications and value
        combinations that are of interest. Measurements and reports SHOULD
        have the flexibility to per-type and aggregate performance.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="a priori Factors">
        <t>The audience for Network Characterization may have detailed
        information about each link that comprises a complete path (due to
        ownership, for example), or some of the links in the path but not
        others, or none of the links.</t>

        <t>There are cases where the measurement audience only has information
        on one of the links (the local access link), and wishes to measure one
        or more of the raw capacity metrics. This scenario is quite common,
        and has spawned a substantial number of experimental measurement
        methods [ref to CAIDA survey page, etc.]. Many of these methods
        respect that their users want a result fairly quickly and in a
        one-trial. Thus, the measurement interval is kept short (a few seconds
        to a minute).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IP-layer Capacity">
        <t>For links, this metric's theoretical maximum value can be
        determined from the physical layer bit rate and the bit rate reduction
        due to the layers between the physical layer and IP. When measured,
        this metric takes additional factors into account, such as the ability
        of the sending device to process and forward traffic under various
        conditions. For example, the arrival of routing updates may spawn high
        priority processes that reduce the sending rate temporarily. Thus, the
        measured capacity of a link will be variable, and the maximum capacity
        observed applies to a specific time, time interval, and other relevant
        circumstances.</t>

        <t>For paths composed of a series of links, it is easy to see how the
        sources of variability for the results grow with each link in the
        path. Results variability will be discussed in more detail below.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IP-layer Utilization">
        <t>The ideal metric definition of Link Utilization <xref
        target="RFC5136"></xref> is based on the actual usage (bits
        successfully received during a time interval) and the Maximum Capacity
        for the same interval.</t>

        <t>In practice, Link Utilization can be calculated by counting the
        IP-layer (or other layer) octets received over a time interval and
        dividing by the theoretical maximum of octets that could have been
        delivered in the same interval. A commonly used time interval is 5
        minutes, and this interval has been sufficient to support network
        operations and design for some time. 5 minutes is somewhat long
        compared with the expected download time for web pages, but short with
        respect to large file transfers and TV program viewing. It is fair to
        say that considerable variability is concealed by reporting a single
        (average) Utilization value for each 5 minute interval. Some
        performance management systems have begun to make 1 minute averages
        available.</t>

        <t>There is also a limit on the smallest useful measurement interval.
        Intervals on the order of the serialization time for a single Maximum
        Transmission Unit (MTU) packet will observe on/off behavior and report
        100% or 0%. The smallest interval needs to be some multiple of MTU
        serialization time for averaging to be effective.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IP-layer Available Capacity">
        <t>The Available Capacity of a link can be calculated using the
        Capacity and Utilization metrics.</t>

        <t>When Available capacity of a link or path is estimated through some
        measurement technique, the following parameters SHOULD be
        reported:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Name and reference to the exact method of measurement</t>

            <t>IP packet length, octets (including IP header)</t>

            <t>Maximum Capacity that can be assessed in the measurement
            configuration</t>

            <t>The time a duration of the measurement</t>

            <t>All other parameters specific to the measurement method</t>
          </list>Many methods of Available capacity measurement have a maximum
        capacity that they can measure, and this maximum may be less than the
        actual Available capacity of the link or path. Therefore, it is
        important to know the capacity value beyond which there will be no
        measured improvement.</t>

        <t>The Application Design audience may have a target capacity value
        and simply wish to assess whether there is sufficient Available
        Capacity. This case simplifies measurement of link and path capacity
        to some degree, as long as the measurable maximum exceeds the target
        capacity.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Variability in Utilization and Avail. Capacity">
        <t>As with most metrics and measurements, assessing the consistency or
        variability in the results gives a the user an intuitive feel for the
        degree (or confidence) that any one value is representative of other
        results, or the underlying distribution from which these singleton
        measurements have come.</t>

        <t>Two questions are raised here for further discussion:</t>

        <t>What ways can Utilization be measured and summarized to describe
        the potential variability in a useful way?</t>

        <t>How can the variability in Available Capacity estimates be
        reported, so that the confidence in the results is also conveyed?</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Test Streams and Sample Size">
      <t>This section discusses two key aspects of measurement that are
      sometimes omitted from the report: the description of the test stream on
      which the measurements are based, and the sample size.</t>

      <section title="Test Stream Characteristics">
        <t>Network Characterization has traditionally used Poisson-distributed
        inter-packet spacing, as this provides an unbiased sample. The average
        inter-packet spacing may be selected to allow observation of specific
        network phenomena. Other test streams are designed to sample some
        property of the network, such as the presence of congestion, link
        bandwidth, or packet reordering.</t>

        <t>If measuring a network in order to make inferences about
        applications or receiver performance, then there are usually
        efficiencies derived from a test stream that has similar
        characteristics to the sender. In some cases, it is essential to
        synthesize the sender stream, as with Bulk Transfer Capacity
        estimates. In other cases, it may be sufficient to sample with a
        "known bias", e.g., a Periodic stream to estimate real-time
        application performance.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Sample Size">
        <t>Sample size is directly related to the accuracy of the results, and
        plays a critical role in the report. Even if only the sample size (in
        terms of number of packets) is given for each value or summary
        statistic, it imparts a notion of the confidence in the result.</t>

        <t>In practice, the sample size will be selected taking both
        statistical and practical factors into account. Among these factors
        are:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>The estimated variability of the quantity being measured</t>

            <t>The desired confidence in the result (although this may be
            dependent on assumption of the underlying distribution of the
            measured quantity).</t>

            <t>The effects of active measurement traffic on user traffic</t>

            <t>etc.</t>
          </list>A sample size may sometimes be referred to as "large". This
        is a relative, and qualitative term. It is preferable to describe what
        one is attempting to achieve with their sample. For example, stating
        an implication may be helpful: this sample is large enough such that a
        single outlying value at ten times the "typical" sample mean (the mean
        without the outlying value) would influence the mean by no more than
        X.</t>

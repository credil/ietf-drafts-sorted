    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a new generic session set up attribute to make
      it possible to negotiate different image attributes such as image size.
      A possible use case is to make it possible for a low-end hand-held
      terminal to display video without the need to rescale the image,
      something that may consume large amounts of memory and processing power.
      The draft also helps to maintain an optimal bitrate for video as only
      the image size that is desired by the receiver is transmitted.</t>

    <section anchor="sec-intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document proposes a new SDP attribute to make it possible to
      negotiate different image attributes such as image size. The term image
      size is defined here as it may differ from the physical screen size of
      for instance a hand-held terminal. As an example it may be beneficial to
      display a video image on a part of the physical screen and leave space
      on the screen for other features such as menus and other info.</t>

      <t>There are a number of benefits with a possibility to negotiate the
      image size:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Less image distortion: Rescaling of images introduces additional
          distortion, something that can be avoided (at least on the receiver
          side) if the image size can be negotiated.</t>

          <t>Reduced receiver complexity: Image rescaling can be quite
          computation intensive. For low end devices this can be a
          problem.</t>

          <t>Optimal quality for the given bitrate: The sender does not need
          to encode an entire CIF (352x288) image if only an image size of
          288x256 is displayed on the receiver screen. This alternatively
          gives a saving in bitrate.</t>

          <t>Memory requirement: The receiver device will know the size of the
          image and can then allocate memory accordingly.</t>

          <t>Optimal aspect ratio: The indication of the supported image sizes
          and aspect ratio allows the receiver to select the most appropriate
          combination based on its rescaling capabilities and the desired
          rendering. For example, if a sender proposes three resolutions in
          its SDP offer, 100x200, 200x100 and 100x100 with sar=1.0 (1:1) etc.
          then the receiver can select the option that fits the receiver
          screen best.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In cases where rescaling is not implemented (for example, rescaling
      is not mandatory to implement in H.264 <xref target="H.264"></xref>),
      the indication of the image attributes may still provide an optimal use
      of bandwidth because the attribute will anyway give the encoder a better
      indication about what image size is preferred and will thus help to
      avoid wasting bandwidth by encoding with an unnecessarily large
      resolution.</t>

      <t>For implementers that are considering rescaling issues, it is worth
      to notice that there are several benefits to do it on the sender
      side:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Rescaling on the sender/encoder side is likely to be easier to do
          as the camera related software/hardware already contains the
          necessary functionality for zooming/cropping/trimming/sharpening the
          video signal. Moreover, rescaling is generally done in RGB or YUV
          domain and should not depend on the codecs used.</t>

          <t>The encoder may be able to encode in a number of formats but may
          not know which format to choose as, without the image attribute, it
          does not know the receiver's performance or preference.</t>

          <t>The quality drop due to digital domain rescaling using
          interpolation is likely to be lower if it is done before the video
          encoding rather than after the decoding especially when low bitrate
          video coding is used.</t>

          <t>If low-complexity rescaling operations such as simple cropping
          must be performed, the benefit with having this functionality on the
          sender side is that it is then possible to present a miniature "what
          you send" image on the display to help the user to target the camera
          correctly.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Several of the existing standards (<xref target="H.263"></xref>,
      <xref target="H.264"></xref> and <xref target="MPEG-4"></xref>) have
      support for different resolutions at different framerates. The purpose
      of this document is to provide for a generic mechanism and is targeted
      mainly at the negotiation of the image size but to make it more general
      the attribute is named 'imageattr'.</t>

      <t>This document is limited to point-to-point unicast communication
      scenarios. The attribute may be used in centralized conferencing
      scenarios as well but due to the abundance of configuration options it
      may then be difficult to come up with a configuration that fits all
      parties.</t>

      <section title="Requirements">
        <t>The design of the image attribute is based on the following
        requirements which are listed only for informational purposes:<list
            style="hanging">
            <t hangText="REQ-1:">Support the indication of one or more set(s)
            of image attributes that the SDP endpoint wish to receive or send.

            receive.</t>

            <t hangText="REQ-3:">Interoperate with codec specific parameters
            such as sprop-parameter-sets in <xref target="H.264"></xref> or

                instance for different video codec alternatives. This however
                requires that the payload type numbers differ. Note that the
                attribute is associated to the codec(s), for instance an SDP
                offer may specify payload type number 101 while the answer may
                specify 102, this may make it troublesome to specify a payload
                type number with the 'imageattr' attribute. See <xref

                specifies the sample aspect ratio associated to the given

                where dx and dy is the physical size of the pixels. Square
                pixels gives a sar=1.0. The parameter sar MAY be expressed as

                are the same (or close), the relation between the x and y
                pixel resolution and the physical size of the image is
                straightforward. If however sar differs from the sample aspect
                ratio of the receiver display this must be taken into
                consideration when the x and y pixel resolution alternatives
                are sorted out. See <xref target="SEC-EX-4"></xref> for an

          require the attribute to be absent in the answer. The reasons for
          this are: <list style="symbols">
              <t>The offerer of the initial SDP is not likely to understand
              the image attribute if it did not include it in the offer,
              bearing in mind that <xref target="sec-syntax-overall"></xref>

        <section anchor="sec-different-pl"
                 title="Different payload type numbers in offer and answer">
          <t>In some cases the answer may specify a different media payload
          type number than the offer. As an example the offer SDP may have the
          m-line <figure>
              <artwork>    ----
    m=video 49154 RTP/AVP 99
    ----</artwork>
            </figure>While the answer SDP may have the m-line <figure>
              <artwork>    ----
    m=video 49154 RTP/AVP 100
    ----</artwork>
            </figure></t>

          <t>If the image attribute in the offer specifies payload type number
          99, this attribute will then have no meaning in the answerers
          receive direction as the m-line specifies media payload type number
          100.</t>

          <t>There are a few ways to solve this<list style="numbers">
              <t>Use a wild card "*" as payload type number in the image
              attribute in the offer SDP. The answer SDP also use the wild
              card. The drawback with this approach is that this attribute
              then applies to all payload type numbers in the media
              description.</t>

              <t>Specify a wild card "*" as payload type number in the image
              attribute in the answer SDP. The offer SDP may contain a defined
              payload type number in the image attribute but the answer SDP
              replaces this with a wild card. The drawback here is similar to
              what is listed above.</t>

              <t>The image attribute is split in two parts in the SDP answer.
              For example the offer SDP (only the parts of interest in this
              discussion) looks like: <figure>
                  <artwork>        ----
        m=video 49154 RTP/AVP 99
        a=imageattr:99 send ... recv ...
        ----</artwork>
                </figure>The answer SDP looks like:<figure>
                  <artwork>        ----
        m=video 49154 RTP/AVP 100
        a=imageattr:99 send ...
        a=imageattr:100 recv ...
        ----</artwork>
                </figure>This alternative does not pose any drawbacks.
              Moreover it allows to specify different image attributes if more
              than one payload type is specified in the offer SDP.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Of the alternatives listed above, the last one MUST be used as it
          is the most safe. The other alternatives MUST NOT be used.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Asymmetry">
          <t>While the image attribute supports asymmetry there are some
          limitations to this. One important limitation is that the codec
          being used can only support up to a given maximum resolution for a
          given profile level.</t>

          <t>As an example H.264 <xref target="H.264"></xref> with profile
          level 1.2 does not support higher resolution than 352x288 (CIF). The
          offer/answer rules imply that the same profile level must be used in
          both directions. This means that in an asymmetric scenario where
          Alice wants an image size of 580x360 and Bob wants 150x120, profile
          level 2.2 is needed in both directions even though profile level 1
          would have been sufficient in one direction.</t>

          <t>Currently, the only solution to this problem is to specify two
          unidirectional media descriptions. Note however that the asymmetry
          issue for the H.264 codec is solved by means of the
          level-asymmetry-allowed parameter in <xref
          target="RFC3984bis"></xref>.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="sec-sendonly-recvonly" title="sendonly and recvonly">
          <t>If the directional attributes a=sendonly or a=recvonly are given
          for a medium, there is of course no need to specify the image
          attribute for both directions. Therefore one of the directions in
          the attribute may be omitted. However it may be good to do the image
          attribute negotiation in both directions in case the session is
          updated for media in both directions at a later stage.</t>

        <section anchor="sec-sar-considerations" title="Sample aspect ratio">
          <t>The relationship between the sar parameter and the x and y pixel
          resolution deserves some extra discussion. Consider the offer from
          Alice to Bob (we set the recv direction aside for the moment):
          <figure>
              <artwork>    ----
    a=imageattr:97 send [x=720,y=576,sar=1.1]
    ----</artwork>
            </figure>If the receiver display has square pixels the 720x576
          image would need to be rescaled to for example 792x576 or 720x524 to
          ensure a correct image aspect ratio. This in practice means that
          rescaling would need to be performed on the receiver side, something
          that is contrary to the spirit of this draft. <vspace />To avoid
          this problem Alice may specify a range of values for the sar
          parameter like:<figure>
              <artwork>    ----
    a=imageattr:97 send [x=720,y=576,sar=[0.91,1.0,1.09,1.45]]
    ----</artwork>
            </figure>Meaning that Alice can encode with any of the mentioned
          sample aspect ratios, leaving to Bob to decide which one he
          prefers.</t>

            <t>The subsections above clearly indicate that this kind of

            conflicts. There are a number of possible solutions, listed below
            without any preference:<list style="symbols">
                <t>Ignore payload format parameters: This may not work well in
                the presence of bad channel conditions especially in the
                beginning of a session. Moreover this is not a good option for
                MPEG-4.</t>

                <t>2nd session-wide offer/answer round: In the 2nd
                offer/answer the codec payload format specific parameters are
                defined based on the outcome of the 'imageattr' negotiation.
                The drawback with this is that set up of the entire session
                (including audio) may be delayed considerably, especially as
                the 'imageattr' negotiation can already itself cost up to two
                offer/answer rounds. Also the conflict between the 'imageattr'
                negotiation and the payload format specific parameters is
                still present after the first offer/answer round and a
                fuzzy/buggy implementation may start media before the second
                offer/answer is completed with unwanted results.</t>

                <t>2nd session-wide offer/answer round only for video: This is
                similar to the alternative above with the exception that set
                up time for audio is not increased, moreover the port number
                for video is set to 0 during the 1st offer answer round to
                avoid that media flows. <vspace />This has the effect that
                video will blend in some time after the audio is started (up
                to 2 seconds delay). This alternative is likely the most
                clean-cut and failsafe alternative. The drawback is, as the
                port number in the first offer is always zero, the media
                startup will always be delayed even though it would in fact
                have been possible to start media already after the first
                offer/answer round.<vspace />Note that according to <xref
                target="RFC3264"></xref>, a port number of zero means that the
                whole media line is rejected meaning that a new offer for the
                same port number should be treated as a completely new stream
                and not as an update. The most safe way to solve this problem
                is to use preconditions, this is however outside the scope of
                this document.</t>

          only one image attribute for several media descriptions the solution
          is either to specify the same image attribute for each media
          description, or to only specify the image attribute for the base
          layer.</t>

        <section anchor="sec-add-params" title="Addition of parameters">
          <t>The image attribute allows for the addition of parameters in the
          future. To make backwards adaptation possible; an entity that
          processes the attribute MUST ignore any unknown parameters in the
          offer and MUST NOT include them in the answer it generates. Addition
          of future parameters that are not understood by the receiving
          endpoint may lead to ambiguities if mutual dependencies between
          parameters exist, therefore addition of parameters must be done with
          great care.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Examples">
      <t>This section gives some more information on how to use the attribute
      by means of a high-level example and a few detailed examples.</t>

      <section title="A High-Level Example">
        <t>Assume that Alice wishes to set up a session with Bob and that
        Alice takes the first initiative. The syntactical white-space
        delimiters (1*WSP) and double-quotes are removed to make reading
        easier.</t>

        <t>In the offer Alice provides information for both the send and
        receive (recv) directions. For the send direction Alice provides a
        list that the answerer can select from. For the receive direction
        Alice may either specify a desired image size range right away or a *
        to instruct Bob to reply with a list of image sizes that Bob can
        support for sending. Using the overall high level syntax the image
        attribute may then look like <figure>
            <artwork>    ----
    a=imageattr:PT send attr-list recv attr-list
    ----</artwork>
          </figure>or<figure>
            <artwork>    ----
    a=imageattr:PT send attr-list recv *
    ----</artwork>
          </figure>In the first alternative the recv direction may be a full
        list of desired image size formats. It may however (and most likely)
        just be a list with one alternative for the preferred x and y
        resolution.</t>

        <t>If Bob supports an x and y resolution in at least one of the X and
        Y ranges given in the send attr-list and in the recv attr-list of the
        offer, the answer from Bob will look like: <figure>
            <artwork>    ----
    a=imageattr:PT send attr-list recv attr-list
    ----</artwork>
          </figure>And the offer answer negotiation is done. Worth noticing
        here is that the attr-list will likely be pruned in the answer. While
        it may contain many different alternatives in the offer it may in the
        end contain just one or two alternatives.</t>

        <t>If Bob does not support any x and y resolution in one of the
        provided send or recv ranges given in the send attr-list or in the
        recv attr-list, the corresponding part is removed completely. For
        instance, if Bob doesn't support any of the offered alternatives in
        the recv attr-list in the offer, the answer from Bob would look
        like:<figure>

          side) to compensate for a sample aspect ratio of 1.1 (11:10) and
          desires an image size on its screen of 800x640.</t>

          <t>There is however a possibility that "recv [x=330,y=250]" is not
          supported. If the case, Bob may completely remove this part or
          replace it with a list of supported image sizes.</t>

          <t>Alice can then select a valid image size which is closest to the
          one that was originally desired (336x256) and performs a second

          <t>In the send direction, sprop-parameter-sets is defined for a

          send direction. This means that if 320x240 is selected, no
          additional offer/answer is necessary. In the receive direction four
          alternative image sizes are offered with 272x224 being the preferred
          choice.</t>

          <t>The answer may look like:</t>

          <t>Indicating (in this example) that the image size is 320x240 in
          both directions. Although the offerer preferred 272x224 for the
          receive direction, the answerer might not be able to offer 272x224
          or not allow encoding and decoding of video of different image sizes
          simultaneously. The answerer sets new sprop-parameter-sets,
          constructed for both send and receive directions at the restricted
          conditions and image size of 320x240.</t>

          <t>Note also that, because the payload type number is changed by the
          answerer, the image attribute is also split in two parts according
          to the recommendation in <xref

          <t>This example illustrates in more detail how compensation for
          different sample aspect ratios can be negotiated with the image
          attribute.</t>

          <t>We set up a session between Alice and Bob, Alice is the offerer
          of the session. The offer (from Alice) contains the image attribute
          below:<figure>
              <artwork>  ----
  a=imageattr:97 \
    send [x=400:16:800],y=[320:16:640],sar=[1.0-1.3],par=[1.2-1.3]] \
    recv [x=800,y=600,sar=1.1]
  ----</artwork>
            </figure></t>

          <t>First we consider the recv direction: The offerer (Alice)
          explicitly states that she wishes to receive the screen resolution
          800x600, however she also indicates that the screen on her display
          does not use square pixels, the sar value=1.1 means that Bob must
          (preferably) compensate for this. <vspace />So.. If Bob's video
          camera produces square pixels, and wishes to satisfy Alice's sar
          requirement, the image processing algorithm must rescale a 880x600
          pixel image (880=800*1.1) to 800x600 pixels (could be done other
          ways).</t>

          <t>... and now the send direction: Alice indicates that she can (in
          the image processing algorithms) rescale the image for sample aspect
          ratios in the range 1.0 to 1.3. She can also provide with a number
          of different image sizes (in pixels) ranging from 400x320 to
          800x640. Bob inspects the offered sar and image sizes and responds
          with the modified image attribute <figure>

   recv [x=464,y=384,sar=1.15] \

 ----</artwork>
            </figure></t>

          <t>Alice will (in order to satisfy Bob's request) need to rescale
          the image from her video camera from 534x384 (534=464*1.15) to
          464x384.</t>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>Following the guidelines in <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>, the IANA
      is requested to register one new SDP attribute:<list hangIndent="20"
          style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Attribute name:">imageattr</t>

          <t hangText="Purpose:">This attribute defines the ability to
          negotiate various image attributes such as image sizes. The
          attribute contains a number of parameters which can be modified in
          and offer/answer exchange.</t>

          <t hangText="Appropriate values:">See <xref
          target="sec-syntax-overall"></xref> of RFCXXXX</t>

      <t>Note to RFC Editor: please replace "RFCXXXX" above with the RFC
      number of this document, and remove this note.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The image attribute and especially the parameters that denote the
      image size can take on values that may cause memory or CPU exhaustion
      problems. This may happen either as a consequence of a mistake by the
      sender of the SDP or as a result of an attack issued by a malicious SDP
      sender. This issue is similar to the case where the a=fmtp line(s) may
      take on extreme values for the same reasons as outlined above.</t>

      <t>A receiver of the SDP containing the image attribute MUST ensure that
      the parameters have values that are reasonable and that the device can
      handle the implications in terms of memory and CPU usage. Failure to do
      a sanity check on the parameters may result in memory or CPU
      exhaustion.</t>

      <t>In principle, for some SDPs containing the image attribute and for
      some deployments, it could be the case that simply checking the
      parameters is not sufficient to detect all potential DoS problems.
      Implementers ought to consider whether there are any potential DoS
      attacks that would not be detected by simply checking parameters.</t>

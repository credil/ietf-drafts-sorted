   size.  A possible use case is to make it possible for a low-end hand-
   held terminal to display video without the need to rescale the image,
   something that may consume large amounts of memory and processing
   power.  The draft also helps to maintain an optimal bitrate for video
   as only the image size that is desired by the receiver is
   transmitted.

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP                Oct 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document proposes a new attribute to make it possible to
   negotiate different image attributes such as image size.  The term
   image size is defined here as it may differ from the physical screen
   size of for instance a hand-held terminal.  As an example it may be
   beneficial to display a video image on a part of the physical screen
   and leave space on the screen for other features such as menus and
   other info.

   There are a number of benefits with a possibility to negotiate the
   image size:

   o  Less image distortion: Rescaling of images introduces additional
      distortion, something that can be avoided (at least on the
      receiver side) if the image size can be negotiated.

   o  Reduced complexity: Image rescaling can be quite computation
      intensive.  For low end devices this can be a problem.

   o  Optimal quality for the given bitrate: The sender does not need to
      encode an entire CIF (352x288) image if only an image size of
      288x256 is displayed on the receiver screen.  This gives
      alternatively a saving in bitrate.

   o  Memory requirement: The receiver device will know the size of the
      image and can then allocate memory accordingly.

   o  Optimal aspect ratio: The indication of the supported image sizes
      and aspect ratio allows the receiver to select the most
      appropriate combination based on its rescaling capabilities and
      the desired rendering.  For example, if a sender proposes three
      resolutions in its SDP offer, 100x200, 200x100 and 100x100 with
      sar=1.0 (1:1) etc. then the receiver can select the option that
      fits the receiver screen best.

   In cases where rescaling is not implemented (for example, rescaling
   is not mandatory to implement in H.264), the indication of the image
   attributes may still provide an optimal use of bandwidth because the
   attribute will anyway give the encoder a better indication about what
   image size is preferred and will thus help to avoid wasting bandwidth
   by encoding with an unnecessarily large resolution.

   For implementers that are considering rescaling issues, it is worth
   notice note that there are several benefits to doing it on the sender
   side:

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP                Oct 2009


   o  Rescaling on the sender/encoder side is likely to be easier to do
      as the camera related software/hardware already contains the
      necessary functionality for zooming/cropping/trimming/sharpening
      the video signal.  Moreover, rescaling is generally done in RGB or
      YUV domain and should not depend on the codecs used.

   o  The encoder may be able to encode in a number of formats but may
      not know which format to choose as it, without the image
      attribute, does not know the receivers performance or preference.

   o  The quality drop due to digital domain rescaling using
      interpolation is likely to be lower if it is done before the video
      encoding rather than after the decoding esp. when low bitrate
      video coding is used.

   o  If low-complexity rescaling operations such as cropping only must
      be performed after all, the benefit with having this functionality
      on the sender side is that it is then possible to present a
      miniature "what you send" image on the display to help the user to
      target the camera correctly.

   Several of the existing standards ([H.263], [H.264] and [MPEG-4])
   have support for different resolutions at different framerates.  The
   purpose of this document is to provide for a generic mechanism and is
   targeted mainly at the negotiation of the image size but to make it
   more general the attribute is named "imageattr".

   The draft is limited to unicast scenarios in general and more
   specific poit-to-point communication.  The attribute may be used in
   centralized conferencing scenarios as well but due to the abundance
   of configuration options it may then be difficult to come up with a
   configuration that fits all parties.


2.  Conventions, Definitions and Acronyms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


3.  Defintion of Attribute

   This section defines the SDP image attribute "imageattr" that can be
   used in an SDP Offer/Answer exchange to indicate various image
   attribute parameters.  In this document, we define the following
   image attribute parameters: image resolution, sample aspect ratio
   (sar), allowed range in picture aspect ratio and the preference of a

   given parameter set over another.  The attribute is however
   extensible and guidelines for defining extensions are provided in
   Section 3.3.9.

3.1.  Requirements

   The image attribute MUST meet the following requirements:

   REQ-1:  Support the indication of one or more set(s) of image
      attributes that the SDP endpoint wish to receive or send.  An
      image attribute set MUST include a specific image size.

   REQ-2:  Support setup/negotiation of image attributes, meaning that
      each side in the Offer/Answer SHOULD be able to negotiate the
      image attributes if prefers to send and receive.

   REQ-3:  Interoperate with codec specific parameters such as sprop-
      parameter-sets in H.264 or config in MPEG4.

   REQ-4:  Make the attribute generic with as little codec specific
      details/tricks as possible in order to be codec agnostic.

   Besides the above mentioned requirements, the requirement below MAY
   be applicable.

   OPT-1:  The image attribute SHOULD support the description of image-
      related attributes for various types of media, including video,
      pictures, images, etc.

3.2.  Attribute syntax

   In this section the syntax of the image attribute is described.  The
   image attribute is a media attribute.  The section is split up in two
   parts, the first gives an overall view of the syntax while the second
   describes how the syntax is used.

3.2.1.  Overall view of syntax

   The syntax for the image attribute is in ABNF [RFC4234]:

       PT = 1*DIGIT / "*"
       attr-list = ( set *(1*WSP set) ) / "*"

       ; see below for a definition of set.
       ----

   o  Maximum one occurrence of the "send" keyword and corresponding
      attr-list is allowed per image attribute.

   o  Maximum one occurrence of the "recv" keyword and corresponding
      attr-list is allowed per image attribute.

   o  PT is the payload type number, it can be set to * to indicate that
      the attribute applies to all payload types in the media
      description.

   o  For sendonly or recvonly streams one of the directions MAY be
      omitted.  See Section 3.3.3, moreover the order of the send and
      recv directions is not important.

   The syntax for the set is given by:

      ----
      set= "[" "x=" range "," "y=" range [ ",sar=" range ]
            [ ",par=" range ] [ ",q=" value ] "]"
       x is the horizontal image size range
       y is the vertical image size range
       sar (sample aspect ratio) is the sample aspect ratio associated
        with the set (optional and MAY be ignored)
       par (picture aspect ratio) is the allowed ratios between the
        displays x and y physical size (optional)
       q (optional with range [0.0..1.0], default value 0.5)
        is the preference for the given set, a higher value means higher
        preference from the sender point of view

       range is expressed in a few different formats
        1) range= value
             a single value
        2) range= "[" value1 ":" [ step ":" ] value2 "]"
             values between value1 and value2 inclusive,
             if step is omitted a stepsize of 1 is implied
        3) range= "[" value 1*( "," value ) "]"
             any value from the list of values
        4) range= "[" value1 "-" value2 "]"
             any real value between value1 and value2 inclusive

        value is a positive integer or real value
        step is a positive integer or real value
         If step is left out in the syntax a stepsize of 1 is implied
        Real values are only applicable for the
         sar, par and q parameters
        Note the use of brackets [..] if more that one value
         is specified.
      ----

   Some further guidelines for the use of the attribute is given below:

   o  The image attribute is bound to a specific media by means of the
      payload type number.  A wild card (*) can be specified for the
      payload type number to indicate that it applies to all payload
      types in the media description.  Several image attributes can be
      defined for instance for different video codec alternatives
      conditioned that the payload type number differs.

   o  The preference for each set is 0.5 by default, setting the
      optional q parameter to another value makes it possible to set
      different preferences for the sets.  A higher value gives a higher
      preference for the given set.

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP                Oct 2009


   o  The sar parameter specifies the sample aspect ratio associated to
      the given range of x and y values.  The sar parameter is defined
      as dx/dy where dx and dy is the size of the pixels.  Square pixels
      gives a sar=1.0.  The parameter sar MAY be expressed as a range.
      If this parameter is not present a default sar value of 1.0 is
      assumed.
      The interpretation of sar differs between the send and the receive
      directions.

      *  In the send direction it defines a specific sample aspect
         ration associated to a given x and y image size (range).

      *  In the recv direction sar expresses that the receiver of the
         given media prefers to receive a given x and y resolution with
         a given sample aspect ratio.

      See Section 3.3.4 for a more detailed discussion.
      The sar parameter will likely not solve all the issues that are
      related to different sample aspect ratios but it can help to solve
      them and reduce aspect ratio distortion.

   o  The par (width/height = x/y ratio) parameter indicates a range of
      allowed ratios between x and y physical size (picture aspect
      ratio).  This is used to limit the number of x and y image size
      combinations, par is given as
       ----
       par=[ratio_min-ratio_max]
       ----
      Where ratio_min and ratio_max are the min and max allowed picture
      aspect ratios.
      If sar and the display sample aspect ration is the same (or close)
      the relation between the x and y pixel resolution and the physical
      size of the image is straightforward.  If however sar differs from
      the sample aspect ratio of the receiver display this must be taken
      into consideration when the x and y pixel resolution alternatives
      are sorted out.

   o  The offerer MUST be able to support the image attributes that it
      offers.

   o  The answerer MAY choose to keep imageattr but is not required to
      do so.  If the attribute is kept in the SDP answer:

      *  The answerer MUST for its receive direction only include one or
         more valid entries taken from the offer.  In other words, the
         answerer MUST for its receive direction only pick one or more
         valid entries from the multidimensional solution space spanned
         by the offer.

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP                Oct 2009


      *  The answerer MAY for its send direction modify the attribute in
         the sense that new entries other than those presented in the
         offer are added.  It must however be noted that this may lead
         to an extra offer/answer exchange of the added parameters are
         not supported by the offerer.

3.2.2.  Syntax description

   In the description of the syntax we here assume that Alice wish to
   setup a session with Bob and that Alice takes the first initiative.
   The syntactical white-space delimiters (1*WSP) and double-quotes are
   removed to make reading easier.

   In the offer Alice provides with information for both the send and
   receive (recv) directions using syntax version 1.  For the send
   direction Alice provides with a list that the answerer can select
   from.  For the receive direction Alice may either specify a desired
   image size range right away or a * to instruct Bob to fill with a
   list of image size that Bob can support to send.  Using the overall
   high level syntax the image attribute may then look like
       ----
       a=imageattr:PT send attr-list recv attr-list
       ----
   or
       ----
       a=imageattr:PT send attr-list recv *
       ----
   In the first alternative the recv direction may be a full list of
   desired image size formats.  It may however (and most likely) just be
   a list with one alternative for the preferred x and y resolution.

   If Bob supports an x and y resolution in the given x and y range the
   answer from Bob will look like:
       ----
       a=imageattr:PT send attr-list recv attr-list
       ----
   And the offer answer negotiation is done.  Worth notice here is that
   the attr-list will likely be pruned in the answer.  While it may
   contain many different alternatives in the offer it may in the end
   contain just one or two alternatives in the end.

   If Bob does not support any x and y resolution in the given x and y
   range in attr-list or a * was given for the recv direction then he
   MUST either:

   o  Provide with another list of options (attr-list).  The answer from
      Bob may then look like:

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP                Oct 2009


       ----
       a=imageattr:PT recv attr-list send attr-list
       ----
      In this case the offer/answer negotiation is not quite done.  To
      complete the offer/answer Alice sends another offer that looks
      like:
       ----
       a=imageattr:PT send attr-list recv attr-list
       ----
      Bob MAY send back an answer to complete the 2nd offer/answer but
      this is not necessary.

   o  Remove the corresponding part completely in which case the answer
      from bob would look like:
       ----
       a=imageattr:PT recv attr-list
       ----
      Again it is worth notice that the attr-list for each direction is
      likely pruned depending on preferred and supported options.

   If the 1st offer (from Alice) already defines a desired image size
   for the recv direction the answerer can do one of the following:

   1.  Accept the image size and return it in the answer.

   2.  Replace with a list of options in the answer.

   3.  Remove the corresponding part completely.  This may happen if it
       is deemed that it is unlikely that the list of options is
       supported.  The answer will then lack a description for the send
       direction and will look like:
       ----
       a=imageattr:PT recv attr-list
       ----

3.3.  Considerations

3.3.1.  No imageattr in 1st offer

   A high end device (Alice) may not see any need for the image
   attribute as it most likely has the processing capacity to rescale
   incoming video and may therefore not include the attribute in the
   offer as it otherwise does not see any use for it.  The answerer
   (Bob) MAY include imageattr in the answer.  This has two
   implications:

   o  Longer session setup time due to extra offer/answer exchanges




Johansson & Jung         Expires April 21, 2010                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP                Oct 2009


   o  There is a risk that Alice does not recognize or support imageattr
      and will thus anyway ignore the attribute.

3.3.2.  Asymmetry

   While the image attribute supports asymmetry there are some
   limitations to this.  One important limitation is that the codec
   being used can only support up to a given maximum resolution for a
   given profile level.

   As an example H.264 with profile level 1.2 does not support higher
   resolution than 352x288 (CIF).  The offer/answer rules essentially
   gives that the same profile level must be used in both directions.
   This means that for an asymmetric scenario where Alice wants an image
   size of 580x360 and Bob wants 150x120 profile level 2.2 is needed in
   both directions even though profile level 1 would have been enough in
   one direction.

   Currently, the only solution to this problem is to specify two
   unidirectional media descriptions.  Note however that the asymmetry
   issue for the H.264 codec is solved in [RFC3984bis].

3.3.3.  sendonly and recvonly

   If the directional attributes a=sendonly or a=recvonly are given for
   a media, there is of course no need to specify the image attribute
   for both directions.  Therefore one of directions in the attribute
   MAY be omitted.  However it may be good to do the image attribute
   negotiation in both directions in case the session is updated for
   media in both directions at a later stage.

3.3.4.  Sample aspect ratio

   The sar parameter in relation to the x and y pixel resolution
   deserves some extra discussion.  Consider the offer from Alice to Bob
   (we set the recv direction aside for the moment):
       ----
       a=imageattr:97 send [x=720,y=576,sar=1.1]
       ----
   If the receiver display has square pixels the 720x576 image would
   need to be rescaled to for example 792x576 or 720x524 to ensure a
   correct image aspect ratio.  This in practice means that rescaling
   would need to be performed on the receiver side, something that is
   contrary to the spirit of this draft.
   To avoid this problem Alice MAY specify a range of values for the sar
   parameter like:

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP                Oct 2009


       ----
       a=imageattr:97 send [x=720,y=576,sar=[0.91,1.0,1.09,1.45]]
       ----
   Meaning that Alice can encode with any of the mentioned sample aspect
   ratios, leaving to Bob to decide which one he prefers.

   The response MUST NOT include the sar parameter if there is no
   acceptable value given.

3.3.5.  SDPCapNeg support

   The image attribute can be used within the SDP Capability Negotiation
   [SDPCapNeg] framework and its use is then specified using the
   "a=acap" parameter.  An example is
       ----
       a=acap:1 imageattr:97 send [x=720,y=576,sar=[0.91,1.0,1.09,1.45]]
       ----

   For use with SDP Media Capability Negotiation extension
   [SDPMedCapNeg], where it is no longer possible to specify payload
   type numbers, it is possible to use the parameter substitution rule,
   an example of this is.
      ----
      ...
      a=mcap:1 video H264/90000
      a=acap:1 imageattr:%1% send [x=720,y=576,sar=[0.91,1.0,1.09,1.45]]
      ...
      ----

   Where %1% maps to media capability number 1.

3.3.6.  Interaction with codec parameters

   As most codecs specifies some kind of indication of for example the
   image size already at session setup, some measures must be taken to
   avoid that the image attribute conflicts with this already existing
   information.

   The following subsections describes the most well known codecs and
   how they define image-size related information.

3.3.6.1.  H.263

   The payload format for H.263 is described in [RFC4629].

   H.263 defines (on the fmtp line) a list of image sizes and their
   maximum frame rates (profiles) that the offerer can receive.  The
   answerer is not allowed to modify this list and must reject a payload



Johansson & Jung         Expires April 21, 2010                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP                Oct 2009


   type that contains an unsupported profile.  The CUSTOM profile may be
   used for image size negotiation but support for asymmetry requires
   the specification of two unidirectional media descriptions using the
   sendonly/recvonly attributes.

3.3.6.2.  H.264

   The payload format for H.264 is described in [RFC3984] and updated in
   [RFC3984bis].

   H.264 defines image size related information in the fmtp line by
   means of sprop-parameter-sets.  According to the specification
   several sprop-parameter-sets may be defined for one payload type.
   The sprop-parameter-sets describe the image size (+ more) that the
   offerer sends in the stream and need not be complete.  This means
   that this does not represent any negotiation.  Moreover an answer is
   not allowed to change the sprop-parameter-sets.

   This configuration may be changed later inband if for instance image
   sizes need to be changed or added.

3.3.6.3.  MPEG-4

   The payload format for MPEG-4 is described in [RFC3016].

   MPEG-4 defines a config parameter on the fmtp line which is a
   hexadecimal representation of the MPEG-4 visual configuration
   information.  This configuration does not represent any negotiation
   and the answer is not allowed to change the parameter.

   Currently it is not possible to change the configuration using inband
   signaling.

3.3.6.4.  Possible solutions

   The subsections above clearly indicate that this kind of information
   must be aligned well with the image attribute to avoid conflicts.
   There are a number of possible solutions:

   o  Ignore payload format parameters: This may not work well in the
      presence of bad channel conditions especially in the beginning of
      a session.  Moreover this is not a good option for MPEG-4.

   o  2nd session-wide offer/answer round: In the 2nd offer/answer the
      codec payload format specific parameters are defined based on the
      outcome of the imageattr negotiation.  The drawback with this is
      that setup of the entire session (including audio) may be delayed
      considerably, especially as the imageattr negotiation can already



Johansson & Jung         Expires April 21, 2010                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP                Oct 2009


      itself cost up to two offer/answer rounds.  Also the conflict
      between the imageattr negotiation and the payload format specific
      parameters is still present after the first offer/anser round and
      a fuzzy/buggy implementation may start media before the second
      offer/answer is completed with unwanted results.

   o  2nd session-wide offer/answer round only for video: This is
      similar to the alternative above with the exception that setup
      time for audio is not increased, moreover the port number for
      video is set to 0 during the 1st offer answer round to avoid that
      media flows.
      This has the effect that video will blend in some time after the
      audio is started (up to 2 seconds delay).  This alternative is
      likely the most clean-cut and failsafe alternative.  The drawback
      is, as the port number in the first offer is always zero, the
      media startup will always be delayed even though it would in fact
      have been possible to start media already after the first offer/
      answer round.

3.3.7.  Change of display in middle of session

   A very likely scenario is that a user switches to another phone
   during a video telephony call or plugs the cellphone into an external
   monitor.  In both cases it is very likely that a renegotiation is
   initiated using the SIP-REFER or SIP-UPDATE methods.  It is
   RECOMMENDED to negotiate the image size during this renegotiation.

3.3.8.  Use with layered codecs

   As the image attribute is a media line attribute, its use with
   layered codecs cause some concern.  If the layers are transported in
   different RTP streams the layers are specified on different media
   descriptions and the relation is specified using the grouping
   framework [GROUPING] and the depend attribute [RFC5583].  As it is
   not possible to specify only one image attribute for several media
   descriptions the solution is either to specify the same image
   attribute for each media description, or to only specify the image
   attribute for the base layer.  [Ed. note, TBD].

3.3.9.  Addition of parameters

   The image attribute opens up for the addition of parameters in the
   future.  To make backwards adaptation possible; an entity that
   process the attribute MUST remove parameters that are not recognized
   before returning the attribute in the SDP answer.  Addition of future
   parameters that are not understood by the receiving endpoint may lead
   to ambiguities if mutual dependencies between parameters exist,
   therefore addition of parameters must be done with great care.

4.  Examples

   A few examples to highlight the syntax, here is assumed where needed
   that Alice initiates a session with Bob

4.1.  Example 1
       ----
       a=imageattr:97 send [x=800,y=640,sar=1.1,q=0.6] [x=480,y=320] \
                      recv [x=330,y=250]
       ----

   Two image resolution alternatives are offered with 800x640 with
   sar=1.1 having the highest preference

   The example also indicates that Alice wish to display video with a
   resolution of 330x250 on her display

   In case Bob accepts the "recv [x=330,y=250]" the answer may look like
       ----
       a=imageattr:97 recv [x=800,y=640,sar=1.1] \
                      send [x=330,y=250]
       ----

   Indicating that the receiver (Bob) wish the encoder (on Alice's side)
   to compensate for a sample aspect ratio of 1.1 (11:10) and desires an
   image size on its screen of 800x640.

   There is however a possibility that "recv [x=330,y=250]" is not
   supported.  If the case, Bob may completely remove this part or
   replace it with a list of supported image sizes.
       ----
       a=imageattr:97 recv [x=800,y=640,sar=1.1] \
                      send [x=[320:16:640],y=[240:16:480],par=[1.2-1.3]]
       ----

   Alice can then select a valid image size which is closest to the one
   that was originally desired (336x256) and performs a second offer/
   answer
       ----
       a=imageattr:97 send [x=800,y=640,sar=1.1] \
                      recv [x=336,y=256]
       ----

   Bob replies with (actually not necessary):
       ----
       a=imageattr:97 recv [x=800,y=640,sar=1.1] \
                      send [x=336,y=256]
       ----

4.2.  Example 2
       ----
       a=imageattr:97 \
         send [x=[480:16:800],y=[320:16:640],par=[1.2-1.3],q=0.6] \
              [x=[176:8:208],y=[144:8:176],par=[1.2-1.3]] \
         recv *
       ----

   Two image resolution sets are offered with the first having a higher
   preference (q=0.6).  The x-axis resolution can take the values 480 to
   800 in 16 pixels steps and 176 to 208 in 8 pixels steps.  The par
   parameter limits the set of possible x and y screen resolution
   combinations such that 800x640 (ratio=1.25) is a valid combination
   while 720x608 (ratio=1.18) or 800x608 (ratio=1.31) are invalid
   combinations.

   For the recv direction (Bob->Alice) Bob is requested to provide with
   a list of supported image sizes

4.3.  Example 3

   In this example is defined a complete SDP offer for the video media
   part
    ----
    m=video 49154 RTP/AVP 99
    a=rtpmap:99 H264/90000
    a=fmtp:99 packetization-mode=0;profile-level-id=42e011; \
      sprop-parameter-sets=Z0LgC5ZUCg/I,aM4BrFSAa
    a=imageattr:99 \
      send [x=176,y=144] [x=224,y=176] [x=272,y=224] [x=320,y=240] \
      recv [x=176,y=144] [x=224,y=176] [x=272,y=224,q=0.6] [x=320,y=240]
    ----

   In the send direction, sprop-parameter-sets is defined for a
   resolution of 320x240 which is the largest image size offered in the
   send direction.  This means that if 320x240 is selected, no
   additional offer/answer is necessary.  In the receive direction four
   alternative image sizes are offered with 272x224 being the preferred
   choice.

   The answer may look like:
       ----
       m=video 49154 RTP/AVPF 99
       a=rtpmap:99 H264/90000
       a=fmtp:99 packetization-mode=0;profile-level-id=42e011; \
         sprop-parameter-sets=Z0LgC5ZUCg/I,aM4BrFSAa
       a=imageattr:99 send [x=320,y=240] recv [x=320,y=240]
       ----

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP                Oct 2009


   Indicating (in this example) that the image size is 320x240 in both
   directions.  Although the offerer preferred 272x224 for the receive
   direction, the answerer might not be able to offer 272x224 or not
   allow encoding and decoding of video of different image sizes
   simultaneously.  The answerer sets new sprop-parameter-sets,
   constructed for both send and receive directions at the restricted
   conditions and image size of 320x240.

4.4.  Example 4

   This example illustrates in more detail how compensation for
   different sample aspect ratios can be negotiated with the image
   attribute.

   We setup a session between Alice and Bob, Alice is the offerer of the
   session.  The offer (from Alice) contains the image attribute below:
     ----
     a=imageattr:97 \
       send [sar=[1.0-1.3],x=400:16:800],y=[320:16:640],par=[1.2-1.3]] \
       recv [sar=1.1,x=800,y=600]
     ----

   First we consider the recv direction: The offerer (Alice) explicitly
   states that she wish to receive the screen resolution 800x600,
   however she also indicates that the screen on her display does not
   use square pixels, the sar value=1.1 means that Bob must (preferably)
   compensate for this.  So..  If Bob's video camera produces square
   pixels, and wish to satisfy Alice's sar requirement, the image
   processing algorithm must rescale a 880x600 pixel image (880=800*1.1)
   to 800x600 pixels (could be done other ways).

   ... and now the send direction: Alice indicates that she can (in the
   image processing algorithms) rescale the image for sample aspect
   ratios in the range 1.0 to 1.3.  She can also provide with a number
   of different image sizes (in pixels) ranging from 400x320 to 800x640.
   Bob inspects the offered sar and image sizes and responds with the
   modified image attribute
       ----
       a=imageattr:97 \
         recv [sar=1.15,x=464,y=384] \
         send [sar=1.1,x=800,y=600]
       ----

   Alice will, in order to satisfy Bob's request, need to rescale the
   image from her video camera from 534x384 (534=464*1.15) to 464x384.

   Neither part is required to rescale like this (sar MAY be ignored),
   the consequence will of course be a distorted image.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Following the guidelines in [RFC4566], the IANA is requested to
   register one new SDP attribute:

   o  Contact name, email address and telephone number: Authors of
      RFCXXXX

   o  Attribute-name: imageattr

   o  Type of attribute: media-level

   o  Subject to charset: no

   This attribute defines the ability to negotiate various image
   attributes such as image sizes.  The attribute contains a number of
   parameters which can be modified in and offer/answer exchange.

   Note to RFC Editor: please replace "RFC XXXX" above with the RFC
   number of this memo, and remove this note.


6.  Security Considerations

   This draft does not add any additional security issues other than
   those already existing with currently specified offer/answer
   procedures.


7.  Acknowledgements

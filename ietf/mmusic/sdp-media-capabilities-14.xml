      <t>Session Description Protocol (SDP) capability negotiation provides a
      general framework for indicating and negotiating capabilities in SDP.
      The base framework defines only capabilities for negotiating transport
      protocols and attributes. In this document, we extend the framework by
      defining media capabilities that can be used to negotiate media types
      and their associated parameters.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Session Description Protocol (SDP) capability negotiation <xref
      target="RFC5939"></xref> provides a general framework for indicating and
      negotiating capabilities in SDP<xref target="RFC4566"></xref>. The base
      framework defines only capabilities for negotiating transport protocols
      and attributes.</t>

      <t>The <xref target="RFC5939"></xref> document lists some of the issues
      with the current SDP capability negotiation process. An additional real
      life case is to be able to offer one media stream (e.g. audio) but list
      the capability to support another media stream (e.g. video) without
      actually offering it concurrently.</t>

      <t>In this document, we extend the framework by defining media
      capabilities that can be used to indicate and negotiate media types and
      their associated format parameters. This document also adds the ability
      to declare support for media streams, the use of which can be offered
      and negotiated later, and the ability to specify session configurations
      as combinations of media stream configurations. The definitions of new
      attributes for media capability negotiation are chosen to make the
      translation from these attributes to "conventional" SDP <xref
      target="RFC4566"></xref> media attributes as straightforward as possible
      in order to simplify implementation. This goal is intended to reduce
      processing in two ways: each proposed configuration in an offer may be
      easily translated into a conventional SDP media stream record for
      processing by the receiver; and the construction of an answer based on a
      selected proposed configuration is straightforward.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="terms" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref> and indicate requirement levels for compliant
      RTP implementations.</t>

      <t></t>

      <t>"Actual Configuration": An actual configuration specifies which
      combinations of SDP session parameters and media stream components can
      be used in the current offer/answer exchange and with what parameters.
      Use of an actual configuration does not require any further negotiation
      in the offer/answer exchange. See [RFC5939] for further details. </t>

      <t>"Base Attributes": Conventional SDP attributes appearing in the base
      configuration of a media block.</t>

      <t>"Base Configuration": The media configuration represented by a media
      block exclusive of all the capability negotiation attributes defined in
      this document, the base capability negotiation document<xref
      target="RFC5939"></xref>, or any other capability negotiation document.
      In an offer SDP, the base configuration corresponds to the actual
      configuration as defined in <xref target="RFC5939"></xref>.</t>

      <t>"Conventional Attribute": Any SDP attribute other than those defined
      by the series of capability negotiation specifications.</t>

      <t>"Conventional SDP": An SDP record devoid of capability negotiation
      attributes.</t>

      <t>"Media Capability": A media format, typically a media subtype such as
      PCMU, H263-1998, or T38. The media capability may also include media
      format parameters and associated attributes.</t>

      <t>"Potential Configuration": A potential configuration indicates which
      combinations of capabilities can be used for the session and its
      associated media stream components. Potential configurations are not
      ready for use, however they are offered for potential use in the current
      offer/answer exchange. They provide an alternative that may be used
      instead of the actual configuration, subject to negotiation in the
      current offer/answer exchange. See <xref target="RFC5939"></xref> for
      further details.</t>

      <t>"Latent Configuration": A latent configuration indicates which
      combinations of capabilities could be used in a future negotiation for
      the session and its associated media stream components. Latent
      configurations are neither ready for use, nor are they offered for
      actual or potential use in the current offer/answer exchange. Latent
      configurations merely inform the other side of possible configurations
      supported by the entity. Those latent configurations may be used to
      guide subsequent offer/answer exchanges, but they are not offered for
      use as part of the current offer/answer exchange. </t>

    <section anchor="sdpmedcap" title=" SDP Media Capabilities">
      <t>The SDP capability negotiation <xref target="RFC5939"></xref>
      discusses the use of any SDP <xref target="RFC4566"></xref> attribute
      (a=) under the attribute capability "acap". The limitations of using
      acap for fmtp and rtpmap in a potential configuration are described in
      <xref target="RFC5939"></xref>; for example they can be used only at the
      media level since they are media level attributes. The <xref
      target="RFC5939"></xref> does not provide a way to exchange media-level
      capabilities prior to the actual offer of the associated media stream.
      This section provides an overview of extensions providing an SDP Media
      Capability negotiation solution offering more robust capabilities
      negotiation. This is followed by definitions of new SDP attributes for
      the solution and its associated updated offer/answer procedures <xref

            audio stream with an H263 video stream. This ability would give
            the offerer a means to limit processing requirements for
            simultaneous streams. This would also permit an offer to include

            the nominal media type. For example, T.38 FAX as an alternative to
            audio/PCMU within an audio stream is identified as audio/T38; a

            ("c="), and, possibly, the deprecated encryption key ("k=").</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="overview" title="Solution Overview">
        <t>The solution consists of new capability attributes corresponding to
        conventional SDP line types, new parameters for the pcfg, acfg, and
        the new lcfg attributes extending the base attributes from <xref
        target="RFC5939"></xref>, and a use of the pcfg attribute to return
        capability information in the SDP answer.</t>

        <t>Several new attributes are defined in a manner that can be related
        to the capabilities specified in a media line, and its corresponding
        rtpmap and fmtp attributes.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>A new media attribute ("a=rmcap") defines RTP-based media
            capabilities in the form of a media subtype (e.g. "PCMU"), and its
            encoding parameters (e.g. "/8000/2"). Each resulting media format
            type/subtype capability has an associated handle called a media
            capability number. The encoding parameters are as specified for
            the rtpmap attribute defined in <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>,
            without the payload type number part.</t>

            <t>A new media attribute ("a=omcap") defines other (non RTP-based)
            media capabilities in the form of a media subtype only (e.g.
            "T38"). Each resulting media format type/subtype capability has an
            associated handle called a media capability number.</t>

            <t>A new attribute ("a=mfcap") specifies media format parameters
            associated with one or more media capabilities. The mfcap
            attribute is used primarily to associate the formatting
            capabilities normally carried in the fmtp attribute. Note that
            media format parameters can be used with RTP and non-RTP based
            media formats.</t>

            <t>A new attribute ("a=mscap") that specifies media parameters
            associated with one or more media capabilities. The mscap
            attribute is used to associate capabilities with attributes other
            than fmtp or rtpmap, for example, the rtcp-fb attribute defined in
            <xref target="RFC4585"></xref>.</t>

            <t>A new attribute ("a=lcfg") specifies latent media stream
            configurations when no corresponding media line ("m=") is offered.
            An example is the offer of latent configurations for video even
            though no video is currently offered. If the peer indicates
            support for one or more offered latent configurations, the
            corresponding media stream(s) may be added via a new offer/answer
            exchange.</t>

            <t>A new attribute ("a=sescap") is used to specify an acceptable
            combination of simultaneous media streams and their configurations
            as a list of potential and/or latent configurations.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>New parameters are defined for the potential configuration (pcfg),
        latent configuration (lcfg), and accepted configuration (acfg)
        attributes to associate the new attributes with particular
        configurations.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>A new parameter type ("m=") is added to the potential
            configuration ("a=pcfg:") attribute and the actual configuration
            ("a=acfg:") attribute defined in <xref target="RFC5939"></xref>,
            and to the new latent configuration ("a=lcfg:") attribute. This
            permits specification of media capabilities (including their
            associated parameters) and combinations thereof for the
            configuration. For example, the "a=pcfg:" line might specify PCMU
            and telephone events <xref target="RFC4733"></xref> or G.729B and
            telephone events as acceptable configurations. The "a=acfg:" line
            in the answer would specify the configuration chosen.</t>

            <t>A new parameter type ("pt=") is added to the potential
            configuration, actual configuration, and latent configuration
            attributes. This parameter associates RTP payload type numbers
            with the referenced RTP-based media capabilities, and is
            appropriate only when the transport protocol uses RTP.</t>

            <t>A new parameter type ("mt=") is used to specify the media type
            for latent configurations.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Special processing rules are defined for capability attribute
        arguments in order to reduce the need to replicate
        essentially-identical attribute lines for the base configuration and
        potential configurations.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>A substitution rule is defined for any capability attribute to
            permit the replacement of the (escaped) media capability number
            with the media format identifier (e.g., the payload type number in
            audio/video profiles).</t>

            <t>Replacement rules are defined for the conventional SDP
            equivalents of the mfcap and mscap capability attributes. This
            reduces the necessity to use the deletion qualifier in the a=pcfg
            parameter in order to ignore rtpmap, fmtp, and certain other
            attributes in the base configuration.</t>

            <t>An argument concatenation rule is defined for mfcap attributes
            which refer to the same media capability number. This makes it
            convenient to combine format options concisely by associating
            multiple mfcap lines with multiple media capabilities.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>This document extends the base protocol extensions to the
        offer/answer model that allow for capabilities and potential
        configurations to be included in an offer. Media capabilities
        constitute capabilities that can be used in potential and latent
        configurations. Whereas potential configurations constitute
        alternative offers that may be accepted by the answerer instead of the
        actual configuration(s) included in the "m=" line(s) and associated
        parameters, latent configurations merely inform the other side of
        possible configurations supported by the entity. Those latent
        configurations may be used to guide subsequent offer/answer exchanges,
        but they are not part of the current offer/answer exchange.</t>

        <t>The mechanism is illustrated by the offer/answer exchange below,
        where Alice sends an offer to Bob:</t>

        protocol <xref target="RFC5939"></xref>, defines transport protocol
        capabilities, in this case Secure RTP (SAVP profile) as the first
        option and RTP (AVP profile) as the second option.</t>

        <t>The "a=rmcap:1,4" line defines two G.729 RTP-based media format
        capabilities, numbered 1 and 4, and their encoding rate. The
        capabilities are of media type "audio" and subtype G729. Note that the
        media subtype is explicitly specified here, rather than RTP payload
        type numbers. This permits the assignment of payload type numbers in
        the media stream configuration specification. In this example, two
        G.729 subtype capabilities are defined. This permits the declaration
        of two sets of formatting parameters for G.729.</t>

        <t>The "a=rmcap:2" line defines a G.711 mu-law capability, numbered
        2.</t>

        <t>The "a=rmcap:5" line defines an audio telephone-event capability,
        numbered 5.</t>

        <t>The "a=mfcap:1" line specifies the fmtp formatting parameters for
        capability 1 (offerer will not accept G.729 Annex B packets).</t>

        <t>The "a=mfcap:4" line specifies the fmtp formatting parameters for
        capability 4 (offerer will accept G.729 Annex B packets).</t>

        <t>The "a=mfcap:5" line specifies the fmtp formatting parameters for
        capability 5 (the DTMF touchtones 0-9,*,#).</t>

        <t>The "a=acap:1" line specified in the base protocol provides the
        "crypto" attribute which provides the keying material for SRTP using
        SDP security descriptions.</t>

        <t>The "a=pcfg:" attributes provide the potential configurations
        included in the offer by reference to the media capabilities,
        transport capabilities, attribute capabilities and specified payload
        type number mappings. Three explicit alternatives are provided; the
        lowest-numbered one is the preferred one. The "a=pcfg:1 ..." line
        specifies media capabilities 4 and 5, i.e., G.729B and DTMF, or media
        capability 1 and 5, i.e., G.729 and DTMF. Furthermore, it specifies
        transport protocol capability 1 (i.e. the RTP/SAVP profile - secure
        RTP), and the attribute capability 1, i.e. the crypto attribute
        provided. Lastly, it specifies a payload type number mapping for
        (RTP-based) media capabilities 1, 4, and 5, thereby permitting the
        offerer to distinguish between encrypted media and unencrypted media
        received prior to receipt of the answer.</t>

        <t>Use of unique payload type numbers in alternative configurations is
        not required; codecs such as AMR-WB <xref target="RFC4867"></xref>
        have the potential for so many combinations of options that it may be
        impractical to define unique payload type numbers for all supported
        combinations. If unique payload type numbers cannot be specified, then
        the offerer will be obliged to wait for the SDP answer before
        rendering received media. For SRTP using SDES inline keying <xref
        target="RFC4568"></xref>, the offerer will still need to receive the
        answer before being able to decrypt the stream.</t>

        <t>The second alternative ("a=pcfg:2 ...") specifies media capability
        2, i.e., PCMU, under the RTP/SAVP profile, with the same SRTP key
        material.</t>

        <t>The third alternative ("a=pcfg:3 ...") offers G.729B unsecured; its
        only purpose in this example is to show a preference for G.729B over
        PCMU.</t>

        <t>Per <xref target="RFC5939"></xref>, the media line, with any
        qualifying attributes such as fmtp or rtpmap, is itself considered a
        valid configuration (the current actual configuration); it has the
        lowest preference (per <xref target="RFC5939"></xref>).</t>

        <t>Bob receives the SDP offer from Alice. Bob supports G.729B, PCMU,
        and telephone events over RTP, but not SRTP, hence he accepts the
        potential configuration 3 for RTP provided by Alice. Bob generates the
        following answer:</t>

        <t>Bob includes the "a=csup" and "a=acfg" attributes in the answer to
        inform Alice that he can support the med-v0 level of capability
        negotiations. Note that in this particular example, the answerer
        supported the capability extensions defined here, however had he not,
        he would simply have processed the offer based on the offered PCMU and
        G.729 codecs under the RTP/AVP profile only. Consequently, the answer
        would have omitted the "a=csup" attribute line and chosen one or both
        of the PCMU and G.729 codecs instead. The answer carries the accepted
        configuration in the "m=" line along with corresponding rtpmap and/or
        fmtp parameters, as appropriate.</t>

        <t>Note that per the base protocol, after the above, Alice MAY
        generate a new offer with an actual configuration ("m=" line, etc.)
        corresponding to the actual configuration referenced in Bob's answer
        (not shown here).</t>

      <section anchor="newattrs" title="New Capability Attributes">
        <t>In this section, we present the new attributes associated with
        indicating the media capabilities for use by the SDP Capability
        negotiation. The approach taken is to keep things similar to the
        existing media capabilities defined by the existing media descriptions
        ("m=" lines) and the associated "rtpmap" and "fmtp" attributes. We use
        media subtypes and "media capability numbers" to link the relevant
        media capability parameters. This permits the capabilities to be
        defined at the session level and be used for multiple streams, if
        desired. For RTP-based media formats, payload types are then specified
        at the media level (see <xref target="ptparm"></xref>).</t>

        <t>A media capability merely indicates possible support for the media
        type and media format(s) in question. In order to actually use a media
        capability in an offer/answer exchange, it MUST be referenced in a
        potential configuration.</t>

        <t>Media capabilities can be provided at the session-level and/or the
        media-level. Media capabilities provided at the session level may be
        referenced in any pcfg or lcfg attribute at the media level
        (consistent with the media type), whereas media capabilities provided
        at the media level may be referenced only by the pcfg or lcfg
        attribute within that media stream only. In either case, the scope of
        the &lt;med-cap-num&gt; is the entire session description. This
        enables each media capability to be uniquely referenced across the
        entire session description (e.g. in a potential configuration).</t>

        <section anchor="mcap" title="The Media Format Capability Attributes">
          <t>Media subtypes can be expressed as media format capabilities by
          use of the "a=rmcap" and "a=omcap" attributes. The "a=rmcap"
          attribute MUST be used for RTP-based media whereas the "a=omcap"
          attribute MUST be used for non-RTP-based (other) media formats. The
          two attributes are defined as follows:</t>

          <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[
a=rmcap:<media-cap-num-list> <encoding-name>/<clock-rate>
                             [/<encoding-parms>]

a=omcap:<media-cap-num-list> <format-name>
                                       ]]></artwork>
          </figure>

          <t>where &lt;media-cap-num-list&gt; is a (list of) media capability
          number(s) used to number a media format capability, the &lt;encoding
          name&gt; or &lt;format name&gt; is the media subtype, e.g.,
          H263-1998, PCMU, or T38, &lt;clock rate&gt; is the encoding rate,
          and &lt;encoding parms&gt; are the media encoding parameters for the
          media subtype. All media format capabilities in the list are
          assigned to the same media type/subtype. Each occurrence of the
          rmcap and omcap attribute MUST use unique values in their
          &lt;media-cap-num-list&gt;; the media capability numbers are shared
          between the two attributes and the numbers MUST be unique across the
          entire SDP session. In short, the rmcap and omcap attributes define
          media capabilities and associate them with a media capability number
          in the same manner as the rtpmap attribute defines them and
          associates them with a payload type number. Additionally, the
          attributes allow multiple capability numbers to be defined for the
          media format in question. This permits the media format to be
          associated with different media parameters in different
          configurations.</t>

          <t>In ABNF, we have:</t>

          </figure>

          <t>The encoding-name, clock-rate and encoding-params are as defined
          to appear in an rtpmap attribute for each media type/subtype. Thus,
          it is easy to convert an rmcap attribute line into one or more
          rtpmap attribute lines, once a payload type number is assigned to a
          media-cap-num (see <xref target="lcfg"></xref>).</t>

          <t>The format-name is a media format description for non-RTP based
          media as defined for the &lt;fmt&gt; part of the media description
          ("m=" line) in <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>. In simple terms, it
          is the name of the media format, e.g. "t38". This form can also be
          used in cases such as BFCP <xref target="RFC4585"></xref> where the
          fmt list in the m-line is effectively ignored (BFCP uses "*").</t>

          <t>The "rmcap" and "omcap" attributes can be provided at the
          session-level and/or the media-level. There can be more than one
          rmcap and more than one omcap attribute at both the session and
          media level (i.e., more than one of each at the session-level and
          more than one of each in each media description). Each media-cap-num
          MUST be unique within the entire SDP record; it is used to identify
          that media capability in potential, latent and actual
          configurations, and in other attribute lines as explained below.
          Note that the media-cap-num values are shared between the rmcap and
          omcap attributes, and hence the uniqueness requirement applies to
          the union of them. When the media capabilities are used in a
          potential, latent or actual configuration, the media formats
          referred by those configurations apply at the media level,
          irrespective of whether the media capabilities themselves were
          specified at the session or media level. In other words, the media
          capability applies to the specific media description associated with
          the configuration which invokes it.</t>

            <t>The appearance of media subtypes with a large number of
            formatting options (e.g., AMR-WB <xref target="RFC4867"></xref>)
            coupled with the restriction that only a single fmtp attribute can
            appear per media format, suggests that it is useful to create a
            combining rule for mfcap parameters which are associated with the
            same media capability number. Therefore, different mfcap lines MAY
            include the same media-cap-num in their media-cap-num-list. When a
            particular media capability is selected for processing, the
            parameters from each mfcap line which references the particular
            capability number in its media-cap-num-list are concatenated
            together via ";", in the order the mfcap attributes appear in the
            SDP record, to form the equivalent of a single fmtp attribute
            line. This permits one to define a separate mfcap line for a
            single parameter and value that is to be applied to each media
            capability designated in the media-cap-num-list. This provides a
            compact method to specify multiple combinations of format
            parameters when using codecs with multiple format options. Note
            that order-dependent parameters SHOULD be placed in a single mfcap
            line to avoid possible problems with line rearrangement by a
            middlebox.</t>

            <t>Format parameters are not parsed by SDP; their content is
            specific to the media type/subtype. When format parameters for a
            specific media capability are combined from multiple a=mfcap lines
            which reference that media capability, the format-specific
            parameters are concatenated together and separated by ";" for
            construction of the corresponding format attribute (a=fmtp). The
            resulting format attribute will look something like the following
            (without line breaks):</t>

            <t>where &lt;fmt&gt; depends on the transport protocol in the
            manner defined in RFC4566. SDP cannot assess the legality of the
            resulting parameter list in the "a=fmtp" line; the user must take
            care to ensure that legal parameter lists are generated.</t>

            <t>The "mfcap" attribute can be provided at the session-level and
            the media-level. There can be more than one mfcap attribute at the
            session or media level. The unique media-cap-num is used to
            associate the parameters with a media capability.</t>

            considered to support comfort noise as defined by Annex B.

                 title="The Media-Specific Capability Attribute">
          <t>Attributes and parameters associated with a media format are
          typically specified using the "rtpmap" and "fmtp" attributes in SDP,
          and the similar "rmcap" and "mfcap" attributes in SDP Media
          Capabilities. Some SDP extensions define other attributes that need
          to be associated with media formats, for example the "rtcp-fb"
          attribute defined in <xref target="RFC4585"></xref>. Such
          media-specific attributes, beyond the rtpmap and fmtp attributes,
          may be associated with media capability numbers via a new
          media-specific attribute, mscap, of the following form:</t>

          <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[
      a=mscap:<media caps star> <att field> <att value>

          </figure>

          <t>where &lt;media caps star&gt; is a (list of) media capability
          number(s), &lt;att field&gt; is the attribute name, and &lt;att
          value&gt; is the value field for the named attribute. Note that the
          media capability numbers refer to media capabilities specified
          elsewhere in the SDP ("rmcap" and/or "omcap"). The media capability
          numbers may include a wildcard ("*"), which will be used instead of
          any payload type mappings in the resulting SDP (see, e.g. <xref
          target="RFC4585"></xref> and the example below). In ABNF, we
          have:</t>

          <t>Given an association between a media capability and a payload
          type number as specified by the pt= parameters in a pcfg attribute
          line, a mscap line may be translated easily into a conventional SDP
          attribute line of the form</t>

          <t><list hangIndent="5">

          <t>A resulting attribute that is not a legal SDP attribute as
          specified by RFC4566 MUST be ignored by the receiver.</t>

          <t>If a media capability number (or range) contains a wildcard
          character at the end, any payload type mapping specified for that
          media specific capability (or range of capabilities) will use the
          wildcard character in the resulting SDP instead of the payload type
          specified in the payload type mapping ("pt" parameter) in the
          configuration attribute.</t>

          <t>A single mscap line may refer to multiple media capabilities;
          this is equivalent to multiple mscap lines, each with the same
          attribute values (but different media capability numbers), one line
          per media capability.</t>

          <t>Multiple mscap lines may refer to the same media capability, but,
          unlike the mfcap attribute, no concatenation operation is defined.
          Hence, multiple mscap lines applied to the same media capability is
          equivalent to multiple lines of the specified attribute in a
          conventional media record.</t>

            <t>A latent configuration represents a future capability, hence
            the pt= parameter is not directly meaningful in the lcfg attribute

            is permitted in order to tie any payload type number parameters
            within attributes to the proper media format. A primary example is
            the case of format parameters for the Redundant Audio Data (RED)
            payload, which are payload type numbers. Specific payload type
            numbers used in a latent configuration MAY be interpreted as
            suggestions to be used in any future offer based on the latent
            configuration, but they are not binding; the offerer and/or
            answerer may use any payload type numbers each deems appropriate.
            The use of explicit payload type numbers for latent configurations
            can be avoided by use of the parameter substitution rule of <xref

          <t>One of the goals of this work is to permit the exchange of
          supportable media configurations in addition to those offered or
          accepted for immediate use. Such configurations are referred to as
          "latent configurations". For example, a party may offer to establish
          a session with an audio stream, and, at the same time, announce its
          ability to support a video stream as part of the same session. The
          offerer can supply its video capabilities by offering one or more
          latent video configurations along with the media stream for audio;
          the responding party may indicate its ability and willingness to
          support such a video session by returning a corresponding latent
          configuration.</t>

          <t>Latent configurations returned in SDP answers MUST match offered
          latent configurations (or parameter subsets thereof). Therefore, it
          is appropriate for the offering party to announce most, if not all,
          of its capabilities in the initial offer. This choice has been made
          in order to keep the size of the answer more compact by not
          requiring acap, rmcap, tcap, etc. lines in the answer.</t>

          <t>Latent configurations may be announced by use of the latent
          configuration attribute, which is defined in a manner very similar
          to the potential configuration attribute. The latent configuration
          attribute combines the properties of a media line and a potential
          configuration. The media type (mt=) and the transport protocol(s)
          (t=) MUST be specified since the latent configuration is independent
          of any media line present. In most cases, the media configuration
          (m=) parameter MUST be present as well (see <xref
          target="examples"></xref> for examples). The lcfg attribute is a
          media level attribute.</t>

          <t><list>
              <t>The lcfg attribute is defined as a media level attribute
              since it specifies a possible future media stream. However the
              lcfg attribute is not necessarily related to the media
              description within which it is provided. Session capabilities
              ("sescap") may be used to indicate this.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Each media line in an SDP description represents an offered
          simultaneous media stream, whereas each latent configuration
          represents an additional stream which may be negotiated in a future
          offer/answer exchange. Session capability attributes may be used to
          determine whether a latent configuration may be used to form an
          offer for an additional simultaneous stream or to reconfigure an
          existing stream in a subsequent offer/answer exchange.</t>

          <t>The latent configuration attribute is of the form:</t>

          <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[
     a=lcfg:<config-number> <latent-cfg-list>

          <t>which adheres to the <xref target="RFC4566"></xref> "attribute"
          production with att-field and att-value defined as:</t>

          <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[
     att-field  = "lcfg"
     att-value  = config-number 1*WSP lcfg-cfg-list

          </figure>

          <t>The media-type (mt=) parameter identifies the media type (audio,
          video, etc.) to be associated with the latent media stream, and MUST
          be present. The pot-cfg-list MUST contain a
          transport-protocol-config-list (t=) parameter and a
          media-config-list (m=) parameter. The pot-cfg-list MUST NOT contain
          more than one instance of each type of parameter list. As specified
          in <xref target="RFC5939"></xref>, the use of the "+" prefix with a
          parameter indicates that the entire configuration MUST be ignored if
          the parameter is not understood; otherwise, the parameter itself may
          be ignored.</t>

          <t>Media stream payload numbers are not assigned by a latent
          configuration. Assignment will take place if and when the
          corresponding stream is actually offered via an m-line in a later
          exchange. The payload-number-config-list is included as a parameter
          to the lcfg attribute in case it is necessary to tie payload numbers
          in attribute capabilities to specific media capabilities.</t>

          <t>If an lcfg attribute invokes an acap attribute that appears at
          the session level, then that attribute will be expected to appear at
          the session level of a subsequent offer when and if a corresponding
          media stream is offered. Otherwise, acap attributes which appear at
          the media level represent media-level attributes. Note, however,
          that rmcap, omcap, mfcap, mscap, and tcap attributes may appear at
          the session level because they always result in media-level
          attributes or m-line parameters.</t>

          <t>The configuration numbers for latent configurations do not imply
          a preference; the offerer will imply a preference when actually
          offering potential configurations derived from latent configurations
          negotiated earlier. Note however that the offerer of latent
          configurations MAY specify preferences for combinations of potential
          and latent configurations by use of the sescap attribute defined in
          <xref target="sescap"></xref>. For example, if an SDP offer
          contains, say, an audio stream with pcfg:1, and two latent video
          configurations, lcfg:2, and lcfg:3, then a session with one audio
          stream and one video stream could be specified by including
          "a=sescap:1 1,2|3". One audio stream and two video streams could be
          specified by including "a=sescap:2 1,2,3" in the offer. In order to
          permit combinations of latent and potential configurations in
          session capabilities, latent configuration numbers MUST be different
          from those used for potential configurations. This restriction is
          especially important if the offerer does not require cmed-v0
          capability and the recipient of the offer doesn't support it. If the
          lcfg attribute is not recognized, the capability attributes intended
          to be associated with it may be confused with those associated with
          a potential configuration of some other media stream.</t>

          attribute <xref target="RFC4568"></xref>, is referenced by a latent
          configuration through an acap attribute, any keying material
          required in the conventional attribute, such as the SDES key/salt
          string, MUST be included in order to satisfy formatting rules for
          the attribute. The actual value(s) of the keying material SHOULD be
          meaningless, and the receiver of the lcfg attribute MUST ignore the
          values.</t>

                   title="Returning Capabilities in the Answer">
            <t>Potential and/or latent configuration attributes may be
            returned within an answer SDP to indicate the ability of the
            answerer to support alternative configurations of the
            corresponding stream(s). For example, an offer may include
            multiple potential configurations for a media stream and/or latent
            configurations for additional streams; the corresponding answer
            will indicate (via an acfg attribute) the configuration accepted
            and used to construct the base configuration for each active media
            stream in the reply, but the reply MAY also contain potential
            and/or latent configuration attributes, with parameters, to
            indicate which other offered configurations would be acceptable.
            This information is useful if it becomes desirable to reconfigure
            a media stream, e.g., to reduce resource consumption.</t>

            <t>When potential and/or latent configurations are returned in an
            answer, all numbering MUST refer to the configuration and
            capability attribute numbering of the offer. The offered
            capability attributes need not be returned in the answer. The
            answer MAY include additional capability attributes and/or
            configurations (with distinct numbering). The parameter values of
            any returned pcfg or lcfg attributes MUST be a subset of those
            included in the offered configurations and/or those added by the
            answerer; values MAY be omitted only if they were indicated as
            alternative sets, or optional, in the original offer. The
            parameter set indicated in the returned acfg attribute need not be
            repeated in a returned pcfg attribute. The answerer MAY return
            more than one pcfg attribute with the same configuration number if
            it is necessary to describe selected combinations of optional or
            alternative parameters.</t>

            <t>Similarly, one or more session capability attributes (a=sescap)
            MAY be returned to indicate which of the offered session
            capabilities is/are supportable by the answerer (see <xref
            target="sescap"></xref>.)</t>

            <t>Note that, although the answerer MAY return capabilities beyond
            those included by the offerer, these capabilities MUST NOT be used
            to form any base level media description in the answer. For this
            reason, it is advisable for the offerer to include most, if not
            all, potential and latent configurations it can support in the
            initial offer, unless the size of the resulting SDP is a concern.
            Either party MAY later announce additional capabilities by
            renegotiating the session in a second offer/answer exchange.</t>

          <section anchor="ptmaping" title="Payload Type Number Mapping">
            <t>When media capabilities defined in rmcap attributes are used in
            potential configuration lines, the transport protocol uses RTP and
            it is necessary to assign payload type numbers. In some cases, it
            is desirable to assign different payload type numbers to the same
            media capability when used in different potential configurations.
            One example is when configurations for AVP and SAVP are offered:
            the offerer would like the answerer to use different payload type
            numbers for encrypted and unencrypted media so that it (the
            offerer) can decide whether or not to render early media which
            arrives before the answer is received. </t>

            <t><list>
                <t>For example, if use of AVP was selected by the answerer,
                then media received by the offerer is not encrypted and hence
                can be played out prior to receiving the answer. Conversely,
                if SAVP was selected, cryptographic parameters and keying
                material present in the answer may be needed to decrypt
                received media. If the offer configuration indicated that AVP
                media uses one set of payload types and SAVP a different set,
                then the offerer will know whether media received prior to the
                answer is encrypted or not by simply looking at the RTP
                payload type number in the received packet.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>This association of distinct payload type number(s) with
            different transport protocols requires a separate pcfg line for
            each protocol. Clearly, this technique cannot be used if the
            number of potential configurations exceeds the number of possible
            payload type numbers.</t>

            <t>In cases in which media capabilities negotiation is employed,
            SDP records are likely to contain conventional attributes such as
            rtpmap, fmtp, and other media-format-related lines, as well as
            capability attributes such as rmcap, omcap, mfcap, and mscap which
            map into those conventional attributes when invoked by a potential
            configuration. In such cases, it MAY be appropriate to employ the
            delete-attributes option <xref target="RFC5939"></xref> in the
            attribute configuration list parameter in order to avoid the
            generation of conflicting fmtp attributes for a particular
            configuration. Any media-specific attributes in the media block
            which refer to media formats not used by the potential
            configuration MUST be ignored.</t>

            is least preferred (the base configuration provided by the "m="

            The rtpmap and fmtp attributes of the base configuration are

          means of the payload type number parameter (pt=) in the appropriate
          potential or latent configuration. For example, the following SDP
          fragment defines a potential configuration with redundant G.711
          mu-law:</t>

          <t>A more general mechanism is provided via the parameter

          <t>If the sequence is found, the sequence is replaced by the payload
          type number assigned to the media capability number, as specified by

          The sequence "%%" (null digit string) is replaced by a single
          percent sign and processing continues with the next character, if
          any.</t>

        <section anchor="sescap" title="The Session Capability Attribute">
          <t>Potential and latent configurations enable offerers and answerers
          to express a wide range of alternative configurations for current
          and future negotiation. However in practice, it may not be possible
          to support all combinations of these configurations. </t>

          <t>The session capability attribute provides a means for the offerer
          and/or the answerer to specify combinations of specific media stream
          configurations which it is willing and able to support. Each session
          capability in an offer or answer MAY be expressed as a list of
          required potential configurations, and MAY include a list of
          optional potential and/or latent configurations.</t>

          <t>The choices of session capabilities may be based on processing
          load, total bandwidth, or any other criteria of importance to the
          communicating parties. If the answerer supports media capabilities
          negotiation, and session configurations are offered, it MUST accept
          one of the offered configurations, or it MUST refuse the session.
          Therefore, if the offer includes any session capabilities, it SHOULD
          include all the session capabilities the offerer is willing to
          support.</t>

          <t>The session capability attribute is a session-level attribute
          described by:</t>

          <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[

          </figure>

          <t>The session-num identifies the session; a lower-number session is
          preferred over a higher-numbered session. Each alt-config list
          specifies alternative media configurations within the session;
          preference is based on config-num as specified in <xref
          target="RFC5939"></xref>. Note that the session preference order,
          when present, takes precedence over the individual media stream
          configuration preference order.</t>

          <t>Use of session capability attributes requires that configuration
          numbers assigned to potential and latent configurations MUST be
          unique across the entire session; <xref target="RFC5939"></xref>
          requires only that pcfg configuration numbers be unique within a

          video streams with a floor control stream. In the latter case, the
          second video stream is optional. The SDP offer might look like the
          following (offering audio, an H.263 video streams, BFCP and another
          optional H.263 video stream)- the empty lines are added for

          <t>An endpoint that doesn't support Media capabilities negotiation,
          but does support H.263 video, would respond with one or two H.263
          video streams. In the latter case, the answerer may issue a second
          offer to reconfigure the session to one audio and one video channel
          using H.264 or H.263.</t>

          <t>Session capabilities can include latent capabilities as well.
          Here's a similar example in which the offerer wishes to initially
          establish an audio stream, and prefers to later establish two video
          streams with chair control. If the answerer doesn't understand Media
          CapNeg, or cannot support the dual video streams or flow control,
          then it may support a single H.264 video stream. Note that
          establishment of the most favored configuration will require two
          offer/answer exchanges.</t>

          <t>In this example, the default offer, as seen by endpoints which do
          not understand capabilities negotiation, proposes a PCMU audio
          stream and an H.264 video stream. Note that the offered lcfg lines
          for the video streams don't carry pt= parameters because they're not
          needed (payload type numbers will be assigned in the offer/answer
          exchange that establishes the streams). Note also that the three
          rmcap, mfcap, and tcap attributes used by lcfg:3 and lcfg:4 are
          included at the session level so they may be referenced by both
          latent configurations. As per <xref target="newattrs"></xref>, the
          media attributes generated from the rmcap, mfcap, and tcap
          attributes are always media-level attributes. If the answerer
          supports Media CapNeg, and supports the most desired configuration,
          it would return the following SDP:</t>

          <t>This exchange supports immediate establishment of an audio stream
          for preliminary conversation. This exchange would presumably be
          followed at the appropriate time with a "reconfiguration"

          streams.</t>

      <section anchor="oaext" title="Offer/Answer Model Extensions">
        <t>In this section, we define extensions to the offer/answer model
        defined in RFC 3264 <xref target="RFC3264"></xref> and RFC 5939 <xref
        target="RFC5939"></xref> to allow for media capabilities and
        parameters, latent configurations and acceptable combinations of media
        stream configurations to be used with the SDP Capability Negotiation
        framework. Note that the procedures defined in this section extend the
        offer/answer procedures defined in [RFC5939] Section 6; those
        procedures form a baseline set of capability negotiation offer/answer
        procedures that MUST be followed, subject to the extensions defined
        here.</t>

        <t>The <xref target="RFC5939"></xref> provides a relatively compact
        means to offer the equivalent of an ordered list of alternative
        configurations for offered media streams (as would be described by
        separate m= lines and associated attributes). The attributes acap,
        mscap, mfcap and rmcap are designed to map somewhat straightforwardly
        into equivalent m= lines and conventional attributes when invoked by a
        pcfg, lcfg, or acfg attribute with appropriate parameters. The a=pcfg:
        lines, along with the m= line itself, represent offered media
        configurations. The a=lcfg: lines represent alternative capabilities
        for future use.</t>

        <section anchor="offergen" title="Generating the Initial Offer">
          <t>The Media Capabilities negotiation extensions defined in this
          document cover the following categories of features:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>Media Capabilities and associated parameters (rmcap, omcap,
              mfcap, and mscap attributes)</t>

              <t>Potential configurations using those media capabilities and
              associated parameters</t>

              <t>Latent media streams (lcfg attribute)</t>

              <t>Acceptable combinations of media stream configurations
              (sescap attribute).</t>
            </list> The high-level description of the operation is as
          follows:</t>

          <t>When an endpoint generates an initial offer and wants to use the
          functionality described in the current document, it SHOULD identify
          and define the media formats and associated parameters it can
          support via the rmcap, omcap, mfcap and mscap attributes. The SDP
          media line(s) ("m=") should be made up with the actual configuration
          to be used if the other party does not understand capability
          negotiations (by default, this is the least preferred
          configuration). Typically, the media line configuration will contain
          the minimum acceptable configuration from the offerer's point of
          view.</t>

          <t>Preferred configurations for each media stream are identified
          following the media line. The present offer may also include latent
          configuration (lcfg) attributes, at the media level, describing
          media streams and/or configurations the offerer is not now offering,
          but which it is willing to support in a future offer/answer
          exchange. A simple example might be the inclusion of a latent video
          configuration in an offer for an audio stream.</t>

          <t>Lastly, if the offerer wishes to impose restrictions on the
          combinations of potential configurations to be used, it will include
          session capability (sescap) attributes indicating those.</t>

          <t>If the offerer requires the answerer to understand the media
          capability extensions, the offerer MUST include a creq attribute
          containing the value "med-v0". If media capability negotiation is
          required only for specific media descriptions, the "med-v0" value
          MUST be provided only in creq attributes within those media
          descriptions, as described in [RFC5939].</t>

          <t>Below, we provide a more detailed description of how to construct
          the offer SDP.</t>

          <section title="Offer with Media Capabilities">
            <t>For each RTP-based media format the offerer wants to include as
            a media capability, the offer MUST include an "rmcap" attribute
            for the media format as defined in Section 3.3.1.</t>

            <t>For each non RTP-based media format the offer wants to include
            as a media capability, the offer MUST include an "omcap" attribute
            for the media format as defined in Section 3.3.1.</t>

            <t>Since the media format capability number space is shared
            between the rmcap and omcap attributes, each media capability
            number provided (including ranges) MUST be unique in the entire
            SDP.</t>

            <t>If an "fmtp" parameter value is needed for a media format
            (whether RTP-based or not) in a media capability, then the offer
            MUST include one or more "mfcap" parameters with the relevant fmtp
            parameter values for that media format as defined in Section
            3.3.2. When multiple "mfcap" parameters are provided for a given
            media capability, they MUST be provided in accordance with the
            concatenation rules in Section 3.3.2.1.</t>

            <t>For each of the media capabilities above, the offer MAY include
            one or more "mscap" parameters with attributes needed for those
            specific media formats as defined in Section 3.3.3. Such
            attributes will be instantiated at the media-level, and hence
            session-level only attributes MUST NOT be used in the "mscap"
            parameter. The "mscap" parameter MUST NOT include an "rtpmap" or
            "fmtp" attribute (rmcap and mfcap are used instead).</t>

            <t>If the offerer wants to limit the relevance (and use of) a
            media capability or parameter to a particular media stream, the
            media capability or parameter MUST be provided within the
            corresponding media description. Otherwise, the media capabilities
            and parameters MUST be provided at the session level. Note
            however, that the attribute or parameter embedded in these will
            always be instantiated at the media-level.</t>

            <t><list style="empty">
                <t>This is due to those parameters being effectively
                media-level parameters. If session-level attributes are
                needed, the "acap" attribute defined in [RFC5939] can be used,
                however it does not provide for media format-specific
                instantiation.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>Inclusion of the above does not constitute an offer to use the
            capabilities; a potential configuration is needed for that. If the
            offerer wants to offer one or more of the media capabilities
            above, they MUST be included as part of a potential configuration
            (pcfg) attribute as defined in Section 3.3.4. Each potential
            configuration MUST include a config-number that is unique in the
            entire SDP (note that this differs from [RFC5939], which only
            requires uniqueness within a media description). Also, the
            config-number MUST NOT overlap with any config-number used by a
            latent configuration in the SDP. As described in [RFC5939], lower
            config-numbers indicate a higher preference; the ordering still
            applies within a given media description only though.</t>

            <t>For a media capability to be included in a potential
            configuration, there MUST be an "m=" parameter in the pcfg
            attribute referencing the media capability number in question.
            When one or more media capabilities are included in an offered
            potential configuration (pcfg), they completely replace the list
            of media formats offered in the actual configuration (m= line).
            Any attributes included for those formats remain in the SDP though
            (e.g., rtpmap, fmtp, etc.). For non-RTP based media formats, the
            format-name (from the "omcap" media capability) is simply added to
            the "m=" line as a media format (e.g. t38). For RTP-based media,
            payload type mappings MUST be provided by use of the "pt"
            parameter in the potential configuration (see Section 3.3.4.2);
            payload type escaping may be used in mfcap, mscap, and acap
            attributes as defined in Section 3.3.7.</t>

            <t>Note that the "mt" parameter MUST NOT be used with the pcfg
            attribute (since it is defined for the lcfg attribute only); the
            media type in a potential configuration cannot be changed from
            that of the encompassing media description.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Offer with Latent Configuration">
            <t>If the offerer wishes to offer one or more latent
            configurations for future use, the offer MUST include a latent
            configuration attribute (lcfg) for each as defined in Section
            3.3.5.</t>

            <t>Each lcfg attribute</t>

            <t><list style="symbols">

                SDP (incl. for any potential configuration attributes). Note
                that config-numbers in latent configurations do not indicate
                any preference order</t>

            <t>Each lcfg attribute MAY include additional capability
            references, which may refer to capabilities anywhere in the
            session description, subject to any restrictions normally
            associated with such capabilities. For example, a media-level
            attribute capability must be present at the media-level in some
            media description in the SDP. Note that this differs from the
            potential configuration attribute, which cannot validly refer to
            media-level capabilities in another media description (per
            [RFC5939], Section 3.5.1).</t>

            <t><list style="empty">
                <t>Potential configurations constitute an actual offer and

            unique in the entire SDP; the lower the session-num the more
            preferred that combination is. Furthermore, sescap preference
            order takes precedence over any order specified in individual pcfg
            attributes.</t>

            <t><list style="empty">

                pcfg-2 will be the most preferred potential configuration.
                Without the sescap, pcfg-1 would be the most preferred.</t>

          <t>When receiving an offer, the answerer MUST check the offer for
          creq attributes containing the value "med-v0"; answerers compliant
          with this specification will support this value in accordance with

          <t>The SDP MAY contain</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>Media capabilities and associated parameters (rmcap, omcap,

              <t>Acceptable combinations of media stream configurations
              (sescap attribute)</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The high-level informative description of the operation is as
          follows:</t>

          <t>When the answering party receives the offer and if it supports
          the required capability negotiation extensions, it should select the
          most-preferred configuration it can support for each media stream,
          and build its answer accordingly. The configuration selected for
          each accepted media stream is placed into the answer as a media line
          with associated parameters and attributes. If a proposed
          configuration is chosen for a given media stream, the answer must
          contain an actual configuration (acfg) attribute for that media
          stream to indicate which offered pcfg attribute was used to build
          the answer. The answer should also include any potential or latent
          configurations the answerer can support, especially any
          configurations compatible with other potential or latent
          configurations received in the offer. The answerer should make note
          of those configurations it might wish to offer in the future.</t>

          <t>Below we provide a more detailed normative description of how the
          answerer processes the offer SDP and generates an answer SDP.</t>

          <section title="Processing Media Capabilities and Potential Configurations">
            <t>The answerer MUST first determine if it needs to perform media
            capability negotiation by examining the SDP for valid and
            preferred potential configuration attributes that include media
            configuration parameters (i.e. an "m" parameter in the pcfg
            attribute).</t>

            <t>Such a potential configuration is valid if:</t>

            <t><list style="numbers">
                <t>It is valid according to the rules defined in [RFC5939]</t>

                <t>It contains a config-number that is unique in the entire
                SDP and does not overlap with any latent configuration
                config-numbers</t>

                <t>All media format capabilities (rmcap or omcap), media
                format parameter capabilities (mfcap), and media-specific
                capabilities (mscap) referenced by the potential configuration
                ("m" parameter) are valid themselves (as defined in Section
                3.3.1, 3.3.2, and 3.3.3) and each of them is provided either
                at the session level or within this particular media
                description.</t>

                <t>All RTP-based media capabilities (rmcap) have a
                corresponding payload type ("pt") parameter in the potential
                configuration that results in mapping to a valid payload type
                that is unique within the resulting SDP.</t>

                <t>Any concatenation (see Section 3.3.2.1) and substitution
                (see Section 3.3.7) applied to any capability (mfcap, mscap,
                or acap) referenced by this potential configuration results in
                a valid SDP.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>Note that, since SDP does not interpret the value of fmtp
            parameters, any resulting fmtp parameter value will be considered
            valid.</t>

            <t>Secondly, the answerer MUST determine the order in which
            potential configurations are to be negotiated. In the absence of
            any Session Capability ("sescap") attributes, this simply follows
            the rules of [RFC5939], with a lower config-number within a media
            description being preferred over a higher one. If a valid "sescap"
            attribute is present, the preference order provided in the
            "sescap" attribute MUST take precedence. A "sescap" attribute is
            considered valid if:</t>

            <t><list style="numbers">
                <t>It adheres to the rules provided in Section 3.3.8.</t>

                <t>All the configurations referenced by the "sescap" attribute
                are valid themselves (note that this can include the actual,
                potential and latent configurations).</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>The answerer MUST now process the offer for each media stream
            based on the most preferred valid potential configuration in
            accordance with the procedures specified in [RFC5939], Section
            3.6.2, and further extended below:</t>

            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>If one or more media format capabilities are included in
                the potential configuration, then they replace all media
                formats provided in the "m=" line for that media description.
                For non-RTP based media formats (omcap), the format-name is
                added. For RTP-based media formats (rmcap), the payload-type
                specified in the payload-type mapping ("pt") is added and a
                corresponding "rtpmap" attribute is added to the media
                description.</t>

                <t>If one or more media format parameter capabilities are
                included in the potential configuration, then the
                corresponding "fmtp" attributes are added to the media
                description. Note that this inclusion is done indirectly via
                the media format capability.</t>

                <t>If one or more media-specific capabilities are included in
                the potential configuration, then the corresponding attributes
                are added to the media description. Note that this inclusion
                is done indirectly via the media format capability.</t>

                <t>When checking to see if the answerer supports a given
                potential configuration that includes one or more media format
                capabilities, the answerer MUST support at least one of the
                media formats offered. If he does not, the answerer MUST
                proceed to the next potential configuration based on the
                preference order that applies.</t>

                <t>If Session Capability ("sescap") preference ordering is
                included, then the potential configuration selection process
                MUST adhere to the ordering provided. Note that this may
                involve coordinated selection of potential configurations
                between media descriptions. The answerer MUST accept one of
                the offered "sescap" combinations (i.e. all the required
                potential configurations specified) or it MUST reject the
                entire session.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>Once the answerer has selected a valid and supported offered
            potential configuration for all of the media streams (or has
            fallen back to the actual configuration plus any added session
            attributes), the answerer MUST generate a valid answer SDP as
            described in [RFC5939], Section 3.6.2, and further extended
            below:</t>

            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>Additional answer capabilities and potential configurations
                MAY be returned in accordance with Section 3.3.6.1. Capability
                numbers and configuration numbers for those MUST be distinct
                from the ones used in the offer SDP.</t>

                <t>Latent configuration processing and answer generation MUST
                be performed, as specified below.</t>

                <t>Session capability specification for the potential and
                latent configurations in the answer MAY be included (see
                Section 3.3.8).</t>
              </list></t>
          </section>

          <section title="Latent Configuration Processing">
            <t>The answerer MUST determine if it needs to perform any latent
            configuration processing by examining the SDP for valid latent
            configuration attributes (lcfg). An lcfg attribute is considered
            valid if:</t>

            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>It adheres to the description in Section 3.3.5.</t>

                <t>It includes a config-number that is unique in the entire
                SDP and does not overlap with any potential configuration
                config-number</t>

                <t>It includes a valid media type ("mt=")</t>

                <t>It references a valid transport capability ("t=")</t>

                <t>All other capabilities referenced by it are valid.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>For each such valid latent configuration in the offer, the
            answerer checks to see if it could support the latent
            configuration in a subsequent offer/answer exchange. If so, it
            includes the latent configuration with the same configuration
            number in the answer, similar to the way potential configurations
            are processed and the selected one returned in an actual
            configuration attribute (see [RFC5939]). If the answerer supports
            only a (non-mandatory) subset of the parameters offered in a
            latent configuration, the answer latent configuration will include
            only those parameters supported (similar to "acfg" processing).
            Note that latent configurations do not constitute an actual offer
            at this point in time; they merely indicate additional
            configurations that could be supported.</t>

            <t>If a Session Capability ("sescap") attribute is included and it
            references a latent configuration, then the answerer processing of
            that latent configuration must be done within the constraints
            specified by that Session Capability, i.e. it must be possible to
            support it at the same time as any required (i.e. non-optional)
            potential configurations in the session capability. The answerer
            may in turn add his own "sescap" indications in the answer as
            well.</t>

        <section anchor="ansproc" title="Offerer Processing of the Answer ">
          <t>The offerer MUST process the answer in accordance with [RFC5939]
          Section 3.6.3, and further explained below.</t>

          <t>When the offerer processes the answer SDP based on a valid actual
          configuration attribute in the answer, and that valid configuration
          includes one or more media capabilities, the processing MUST
          furthermore be done as if the offer was sent using those media
          capabilities instead of the actual configuration. In particular, the
          media formats in the "m=" line, and any associated payload type
          mappings (rtpmap), fmtp parameters (mfcap) and media-specific
          attributes (mscap) MUST be used. Note that this may involve use of
          concatenation and substitution rules (see Section 3.3.2.1 and
          3.3.7). The actual configuration attribute may also be used to infer
          the lack of acceptability of higher-preference configurations that
          were not chosen, subject to any constraints provided by a Session
          Capability attribute ("sescap") in the offer. Note that the base
          specification [RFC5939] requires the answerer to choose the highest
          preference configuration it can support, subject to local
          policies.</t>

          <t>When the offerer receives the answer, it SHOULD furthermore make
          note of any capabilities and/or latent configurations included for
          future use, and any constraints on how those may be combined.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="sesmod" title="Modifying the Session">
          <t>If, at a later time, one of the parties wishes to modify the
          operating parameters of a session, e.g., by adding a new media
          stream, or by changing the properties used on an existing stream, it
          can do so via the mechanisms defined for offer/answer <xref
          target="RFC3264"></xref>. If the initiating party has remembered the
          codecs, potential configurations, latent configurations and session
          capabilities provided by the other party in the earlier negotiation,
          it MAY use this knowledge to maximize the likelihood of a successful
          modification of the session. Alternatively, the initiator MAY
          perform a new capabilities exchange as part of the reconfiguration.
          In such a case, the new capabilities will replace the
          previously-negotiated capabilities. This may be useful if conditions
          change on the endpoint.</t>

        stream and provide the lowest precedence configuration (PCMU without
        any DTMF encoding). The rmcap lines define the RTP-based media
        capabilities (PCMU, G729, telephone-event, H263-1998 and H264) and the
        omcap line defines the non-RTP based media capability (wildcard). The

        attribute.</t>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t></t>

      <t>The security considerations of <xref target="RFC5939"></xref> apply
      for this document.</t>

      <t>In [RFC5939], it was noted that negotiation of transport protocols
      (e.g. secure and non-secure) and negotiation of keying methods and
      material are potential security issues that warrant integrity protection
      to remedy. Latent configuration support provides hints to the other side
      about capabilities supported for further offer/answer exchanges,
      including transport protocols and attribute capabilities, e.g. for
      keying methods. If an attacker can remove or alter latent configuration
      information to suggest that only insecure or less secure alternatives
      are supported, then he may be able to force negotiation of a less secure
      session than would otherwise have occurred. While the specific attack as
      described here differs from those described in [RFC5939], the
      considerations and mitigation strategies are similar to those described
      in [RFC5939].</t>

      <t>Another variation on the above attack involves the Session Capability
      ("sescap") attribute defined in this document. The "sescap" enables a
      preference order to be specified for all the potential configurations,
      and that preference will take precedence over any preference indication
      provided in individual potential configuration attributes. Consequently,
      an attacker that can insert or modify a "sescap" attribute may be able
      to force negotiation of an insecure or less secure alternative than
      would otherwise have occurred. Again, the considerations and mitigation
      strategies are similar to those described in [RFC5939].</t>

      <t>The addition of negotiable media formats and their associated
      parameters, defined in this specification can cause problems for
      middleboxes which attempt to control bandwidth utilization, media flows,
      and/or processing resource consumption as part of network policy, but
      which do not understand the media capability negotiation feature. As for
      the initial CapNeg work [RFC5939], the SDP answer is formulated in such
      a way that it always carries the selected media encoding for every media
      stream selected. Pending an understanding of capabilities negotiation,
      the middlebox should examine the answer SDP to obtain the best picture
      of the media streams being established. As always, middleboxes can best
      do their job if they fully understand media capabilities
      negotiation.</t>

            <t>Removed "dummy" form in the pcfg payload-type-number, since the
            functionality is redundant with the non-RTP media capability
            (omcap) and it was inconsistent with other RTP payload type
            operation.</t>

            <t>Clarified that latent configuration attribute (lcfg) can only
            be used at the media level and hence (technically) as part of a
            media description</t>

            <t>Rewrote offer/answer sections and expanded significantly on

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Defined the latent configuration attribute as a media-level
            attribute because it specifies a possible future media stream.
            Added text to clarify how to specify alternative configurations of
            a single latent stream and/or multiple streams.</t>

            <t>Improved the definition of the session capability attribute to
            permit both required configurations and optional configurations -
            latent configurations cannot be required because they have not yet
            been offered.</t>

            <t>Removed the special-case treatment of conflicts between
            base-level fmtp attributes and fmtp attributes generated for a

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The "mcap" attribute is enhanced to include the role of the
            "ecap" attribute; the latter is eliminated.</t>

            <t>The "fcap" attribute has been renamed "mfcap". New replacement
            rules vis-a-vis fmtp attributes in the base media specification
            have been added.</t>

            <t>A new "mscap" attribute is defined to handle the problem of
            attributes (other than rtpmap and fmtp) that are specific to a
            particular payload type.</t>

            <t>New rules for processing the mcap, mfcap, and mscap attributes,
            and overriding standard rtpmap, fmtp, or other media-specific
            attributes, are put forward to reduce the need to use the deletion
            option in the a= parameter of the potential configuration (pcfg)
            attribute.</t>

            <t>A new parameter, "mt=" is added to the latent configuration
            attribute (lcfg) to specify the media stream type (audio, video,
            etc.) when the lcfg is declared at the session level.</t>

            <t>The examples are expanded.</t>

            <t>Numerous typos and misspellings have been corrected.</t>
          </list></t>

      <section title="Changes from version 01">
        <t>The documents adds a new attribute for specifying bandwidth
        capability and a parameter to list in the potential configuration.
        Other changes are to align the document with the terminology and
        attribute names from draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation-07.
        The document also clarifies some previous open issues.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Changes from version 00">
        <t>The major changes include taking out the "mcap" and "cptmap"
        parameter. The mapping of payload type is now in the "pt" parameter of
        "pcfg". Media subtype need to explicitly defined in the "cmed"

          <abstract>
            <t>Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal
            syntax. Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form
            (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many
            Internet specifications. The current specification documents ABNF.
            It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable
            representational power. The differences between standard BNF and
            ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives,
            order-independence, and value ranges. This specification also
            supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core
            lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet
            specifications. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This document defines a mechanism by which two entities can
            make use of the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to arrive at a
            common view of a multimedia session between them. In the model,
            one participant offers the other a description of the desired
            session from their perspective, and the other participant answers
            with the desired session from their perspective. This offer/answer
            model is most useful in unicast sessions where information from
            both participants is needed for the complete view of the session.
            The offer/answer model is used by protocols like the Session
            Initiation Protocol (SIP). [STANDARDS TRACK]</t>

            <t>&lt;p&gt;This document defines a Session Description Protocol
            (SDP) cryptographic attribute for unicast media streams. The
            attribute describes a cryptographic key and other parameters that
            serve to configure security for a unicast media stream in either a
            single message or a roundtrip exchange. The attribute can be used
            with a variety of SDP media transports, and this document defines
            how to use it for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
            unicast media streams. The SDP crypto attribute requires the
            services of a data security protocol to secure the SDP message.

          <abstract>
            <t>Real-time media streams that use RTP are, to some degree,
            resilient against packet losses. Receivers may use the base
            mechanisms of the Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) to
            report packet reception statistics and thus allow a sender to
            adapt its transmission behavior in the mid-term. This is the sole
            means for feedback and feedback-based error repair (besides a few
            codec-specific mechanisms). This document defines an extension to
            the Audio-visual Profile (AVP) that enables receivers to provide,
            statistically, more immediate feedback to the senders and thus
            allows for short-term adaptation and efficient feedback-based
            repair mechanisms to be implemented. This early feedback profile
            (AVPF) maintains the AVP bandwidth constraints for RTCP and
            preserves scalability to large groups. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

            <t>This document specifies a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
            payload format to be used for Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) and
            Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB) encoded speech signals. The
            payload format is designed to be able to interoperate with
            existing AMR and AMR-WB transport formats on non-IP networks. In
            addition, a file format is specified for transport of AMR and
            AMR-WB speech data in storage mode applications such as email. Two
            separate media type registrations are included, one for AMR and
            one for AMR-WB, specifying use of both the RTP payload format and
            the storage format. This document obsoletes RFC 3267. [STANDARDS

            <t>This document specifies a few extensions to the messages
            defined in the Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback (AVPF). They are
            helpful primarily in conversational multimedia scenarios where

            Full Intra Request, Temporary Maximum Media Stream Bit Rate, and

          <abstract>
            <t>This memo describes how to carry dual-tone multifrequency
            (DTMF) signalling, other tone signals, and telephony events in RTP
            packets. It obsoletes RFC 2833.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; This memo
            captures and expands upon the basic framework defined in RFC 2833,
            but retains only the most basic event codes. It sets up an IANA
            registry to which other event code assignments may be added.
            Companion documents add event codes to this registry relating to
            modem, fax, text telephony, and channel-associated signalling
            events. The remainder of the event codes defined in RFC 2833 are
            conditionally reserved in case other documents revive their
            use.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; This document provides a number of
            clarifications to the original document. However, it specifically
            differs from RFC 2833 by removing the requirement that all
            compliant implementations support the DTMF events. Instead,
            compliant implementations taking part in out-of-band negotiations
            of media stream content indicate what events they support. This
            memo adds three new procedures to the RFC 2833 framework:
            subdivision of long events into segments, reporting of multiple
            events in a single packet, and the concept and reporting of state
            events. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>It has been identified that Interactive Connectivity Establishment
      (ICE) RFC5245 is missing a registry for ICE options. This document
      defines this missing IANA registry and updates RFC5245.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC5245">"Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE):
      A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for
      Offer/Answer"</xref> defines a concept of ICE Options. However, the ICE
      RFC fails to create an IANA registry for ICE options. As one ICE option
      is under specification in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-ecn-for-rtp"></xref>, there is now a need to
      create the registry.</t>

      <t>RFC 5245 says: "ICE provides for extensibility by allowing an offer
      or answer to contain a series of tokens that identify the ICE extensions
      used by that agent. If an agent supports an ICE extension, it MUST
      include the token defined for that extension in the ice-options
      attribute."</t>

      <t>Thus, as future extensions are defined, these ICE options needs to be
      registered with IANA to ensure non-conflicting identification. The ICE
      options identifiers are used in signalling between the ICE endpoints to
      negotiate extension support. RFC 5245 defines one method of signalling
      these ICE options, using <xref target="RFC3264">SDP with
      Offer/Answer</xref>.</t>

      <t>This document updates the ICE specification <xref
      target="RFC5245"></xref> to define the "Interactive Connectivity
      Establishment (ICE) Options" registry.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements Language">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document defines a registry "Interactive Connectivity
      Establishment (ICE) Options" for ICE options that can be used in SDP
      "ice-options" attribute or other signalling parameters carrying the ICE
      options.</t>

      <section title="ICE Options">
        <t>An ICE option identifier MUST fulfill the <xref
        target="RFC5234">ABNF</xref> syntax for "ice-option-tag" as specified
        in <xref target="RFC5245"></xref>. This syntax is reproduced here for
        simplicity, but the authoritative definition is in the ICE RFC:</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[ice-option-tag        = 1*ice-char
ice-char              = ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "/"]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>ICE options are of unlimited length by the syntax, however they are
        RECOMMENDED to be no longer than 20 characters. This is to reduce
        message sizes and allow for efficient parsing.</t>

        <t>Registration of an ICE option in the "Interactive Connectivity
        Establishment (ICE) Options" registry is done using the Specification
        Required policy as defined in <xref target="RFC5226">"Guidelines for
        Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs"</xref>.</t>

        <t>A registration request MUST include the following information:<list
            style="symbols">
            <t>The ICE option identifier to be registered</t>

            <t>Name, Email and Address of contact person for the
            registration</t>

            <t>Organization or individuals having the change control</t>

            <t>Short description of the ICE extension to which the option
            relates</t>

            <t>Reference(s) to the specification defining the ICE option and
            the related extensions</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>This document registers no ICE option.</t>
      </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>As this document defines an IANA registry for an already existing
      concept there are no new security considerations.</t>

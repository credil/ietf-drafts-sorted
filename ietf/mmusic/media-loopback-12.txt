 Abstract 
     
    The wide deployment of Voice over IP (VoIP), Real-time Text and 
    Video over IP services has introduced new challenges in managing 
    and maintaining voice/real-time Text/video quality, reliability, 
    and overall performance.  In particular, media delivery is an area 
    that needs attention.  One method of meeting these challenges is 
    monitoring the media delivery performance by looping media back to 
    the transmitter.  This is typically referred to as "active 
    monitoring" of services.   Media loopback is especially popular in 
    ensuring the quality of transport to the edge of a given VoIP, 
    Real-time Text or Video over IP service.  Today in networks that 
    deliver real-time media, short of running 'ping' and 'traceroute' 
    to the edge, service providers are left without the necessary tools 
    to actively monitor, manage, and diagnose quality issues with their 
    service.  The extension defined herein adds new SDP media 
    attributes which enables establishment of media sessions where the 
    media is looped back to the transmitter. Such media sessions will 
    serve as monitoring and troubleshooting tools by providing the 
    means for measurement of more advanced VoIP, Real-time Text and 
    Video Over IP performance metrics.

 1.     Introduction 
  
  
    The overall quality, reliability, and performance of VoIP, 
    Real-time Text and Video over IP services rely on the performance 
    and quality of the media path.  In order to assure the quality of 
    the delivered media there is a need to monitor the performance of 
    the media transport.  One method of monitoring and managing the 
    overall quality of VoIP, Real-time Text and Video over IP Services 
    is through monitoring the quality of the media in an active 
    session.  This type of "active monitoring" of services is a method 
    of pro-actively managing the performance and quality of VoIP based 
    services. 
     
    The goal of active monitoring is to measure the media quality of a 
    VoIP, Real-time Text or Video over IP session.  A way to achieve 
    this goal is to request an endpoint to loop media back to the other

    endpoint and to provide media statistics (e.g., RTCP and RTCP XR 
    information).  Another method involves deployment of special 
    endpoints that always loop incoming media back for sessions.  
    Although the latter method has been used and is functional, it does 
    not scale to support large networks and introduces new network 
    management challenges.  Further, it does not offer the granularity 
    of testing a specific endpoint that may be exhibiting problems. 
     
    The extension defined in this memo introduces new SDP media 
    attributes that enable establishment of media sessions where the 
    media is looped back to the transmitter.  The offer/answer model 
    [RFC3264] is used to establish a loopback connection.  Furthermore, 
    this extension provides guidelines on handling RTP [RFC3550], as 
    well as usage of RTCP [RFC3550] and RTCP XR [RFC3611] for reporting 
    media related measurements. 
     
     
 2.     Terminology 
  
  
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
    this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. 
  
     
 3.     Offering Entity Behavior 
     
     
    An offering entity compliant to this memo and attempting to 
    establish a media session with media loopback MUST include 
    "loopback" media attributes for each individual media description 
    in the offer message.  The offering entity MUST look for the 
    "loopback" media attributes in the media description(s) of the 
    response from the answering entity for confirmation that the 
    request is accepted. 
     
     
 4.     Answering Entity Behavior 
  
     
    An answering entity compliant to this specification and receiving 
    an offer containing media descriptions with the "loopback" media 
    attributes, MUST acknowledge the request by including the received 
    "loopback" media attributes for each media description in its 
    response.  The server MAY reject the "loopback" request for 
    specific media types as defined in section 5.4.1 of this 
    specification.

    An answering entity that is not compliant to this specification and 
    which receives an offer with the "loopback" media attributes MAY 
    ignore the attribute and treat the incoming offer as a normal 
    request. 
         
  
 5.     SDP Constructs Syntax 
  
  
    Two new media attributes are defined: one indicates the type of 
    loopback and one indicates the mode of the loopback. 
     
     
 5.1      Loopback Type Attribute 
     
     
    The loopback type is a property media attribute with the following 
    syntax:  
     
       a=loopback:<loopback-type> 
     
    Following is the Augmented BNF [RFC5234] for loopback-type: 
     
    loopback-type          = loopback-choice [1*SP loopback-choice] 
    loopback-choice        = loopback-type-pkt / loopback-type-media 
    loopback-type-pkt      = "rtp-pkt-loopback" 
    loopback-type-media    = "rtp-media-loopback" 
     
    The loopback type is used to indicate the type of loopback.  The 
    loopback-type values are rtp-pkt-loopback, and rtp-media-loopback. 
     
    rtp-pkt-loopback: In this mode, the RTP packets are looped back to 
    the sender at a point before the encoder/decoder function in the 
    receive direction to a point after the encoder/decoder function in 
    the send direction. This effectively re-encapsulates the RTP 
    payload with the RTP/UDP/IP overheads appropriate for sending it in 
    the reverse direction.  Any type of encoding related functions, 
    such as packet loss concealment, MUST NOT be part of this type of 
    loopback path. In this mode the RTP packets are looped back with a 
    new payload type and format.  Section 7 describes the payload 
    formats that MUST be used for this type of loopback.  
     
    rtp-media-loopback: This loopback is activated as close as possible 
    to the analog interface and after the decoder so that the RTP 
    packets are subsequently re-encoded prior to transmission back to 
    the sender.

 Internet-Draft            SDP Media Loopback               Januar 2010 
  
 5.2      Loopback Mode Attribute 
     
     
    The loopback mode is a value media attribute that is used to 
    indicate the mode of the loopback.  These attributes are additional 
    mode attributes like sendonly, recvonly, etc.  The syntax of the 
    loopback mode media attribute is: 
     
       a=<loopback-mode>:<fmt>... 
     
    The loopback-mode values are loopback-source and loopback-mirror. 
     
    loopback-source: This attribute specifies that the sender is the 
    media source and expects the receiver to act as a loopback-mirror. 
     
    loopback-mirror: This attribute specifies that the receiver will 
    mirror (echo) all received media back to the sender of the RTP 
    stream.  No media is generated locally by the receiver for 
    transmission in the mirrored stream unless the loopback primer 
    payload type (described in Section 8 of this document) is requested 
    by the loopback-source or included in the response by 
    loopback-mirror. 
     
    <fmt> is a media format description. The format description has the 
    semantics as defined in section 5.14 of RFC 4566[RFC4566]. When 
    loopback-mode is specified as loopback-source, the media format 
    corresponds to the RTP payload types the source is willing to send. 
    When loopback-mode is specified as loopback-mirror, the media 
    format corresponds to the RTP payload types the mirror is willing 
    to receive. The payload types specified in m= line for a 
    loopback-source specify the payloads the source is willing to 
    receive. Similarly, for the loopback-mirror these payload types 
    specify the payloads it is willing to send. 
     
  
     
 5.3      Generating the Offer for Loopback Session 
     
     
    If an offerer wishes to make a loopback request, it MUST include 
    both the loopback-type and loopback-mode attribute in a valid SDP 
    offer: 
     
    Example:   m=audio 41352 RTP/AVP 0 8 100 
               a=loopback:rtp-media-loopback 
               a=loopback-source:0 8 100 
               a=rtpmap:0 pcmu/8000 
               a=rtpmap:8 pcma/8000 
               a=rtpmap:100 G7221/16000/1

 Internet-Draft            SDP Media Loopback               Januar 2010 
  
     
     
    Note: A loopback offer in a given media description MUST NOT 
    contain the standard mode attributes sendonly, recvonly, sendrecv 
    or inactive. The loopback-mode attributes (loopback-source and 
    loopback-mirror) replace the standard attributes. 
     
    The offerer may offer more than one loopback-type in the SDP offer. 
    In this case the answer MUST include only one of the loopback types 
    that are accepted by the answerer.  The answerer SHOULD give 
    preference to the first loopback-type in the SDP offer. 
     
    For loopback-source media (e.g. audio) streams, the port number and 
    the address in the offer (m= line) indicate where the offerer would 
    like to receive the media stream.  The payload type numbers 
    indicate the value of the payload the offerer expects to receive.  
    The RTP payload types indicated in the a=loopback-source line are 
    the payload types for the codecs the offerer is willing to send. 
    However, the answer might indicate a different payload type number 
    for the same codec.  In that case, the offerer MUST send the 
    payload type received in the answer. 
     
    If loopback-type is rtp-pkt-loopback, the loopback-mirror MUST send 
    and the loopback-source MUST receive the looped back packets 
    encoded in one of the two payload formats (encapsulated RTP or 
    payload loopback) as defined in section 7.  
     
    Example:   m=audio 41352 RTP/AVP 112 
               a=loopback:rtp-pkt-loopback 
               a=loopback-source:0 8 
               a=rtpmap:112 encaprtp/8000 
     
    Example:   m=audio 41352 RTP/AVP 112 
               a=loopback:rtp-pkt-loopback 
               a=loopback-source:0 8 
               a=rtpmap:112 rtploopback/8000 
     
     
     
  
 5.4      Generating the Answer for Loopback Session 
     
     
    If an answerer wishes to accept the loopback request it MUST 
    include both the loopback mode and loopback type attribute in the 
    answer. If a stream is offered with loopback-source or 
    loopback-mirror attributes, the corresponding stream MUST be 
    loopback-mirror or loopback-source respectively, provided that 
    answerer is capable of supporting the requested loopback-type.

 Internet-Draft            SDP Media Loopback               Januar 2010 
  
     
    For example, if the offer contains: 
     
       m=audio 41352 RTP/AVP 0 8 
       a=loopback:rtp-media-loopback 
       a=loopback-source:0 8 
     
    The answer that is capable of supporting the offer MUST contain: 
     
       m=audio 41352 RTP/AVP 0 8 
       a=loopback:rtp-media-loopback  
       a=loopback-mirror:0 8  
     
    As previously stated if a stream is offered with multiple loopback 
    type attributes, the corresponding stream MUST contain only one 
    loopback type attribute selected by the answerer. 
     
    For example, if the offer contains: 
     
       m=audio 41352 RTP/AVP 0 8 112 
       a=loopback:rtp-media-loopback rtp-pkt-loopback 
       a=loopback-source:0 8  
     
    The answer that is capable of supporting the offer and chooses to 
    loopback the media using the rtp-media-loopback type MUST contain: 
     
       m=audio 41352 RTP/AVP 0 8  
       a=loopback:rtp-media-loopback  
       a=loopback-mirror:0 8 
     
    As specified in section 7, if the loopback-type is 
    rtp-pkt-loopback, either the encapsulated RTP payload format or 
    direct loopback RTP payload format MUST be used for looped back 
    packets. 
     
    For example, if the offer contains: 
     
       m=audio 41352 RTP/AVP 112 113 
       a=loopback:rtp-pkt-loopback 
       a=loopback-source:0 8 
       a=rtpmap:112 encaprtp/8000 
       a=rtpmap:113 rtploopback/8000 
     
    The answer that is capable of supporting the offer MUST contain one 
    of the following: 
     
       m=audio 41352 RTP/AVP 112 
       a=loopback:rtp-pkt-loopback 
       a=loopback-mirror:0 8

 5.4.1 Rejecting the Loopback Offer 
     
     
    An offered stream with loopback-source MAY be rejected if the 
    loopback-type is not specified, the specified loopback-type is not 
    supported, or the endpoint cannot honor the offer for any other 
    reason.  The Loopback request may be rejected by setting the media 
    port number to zero in the answer as per RFC 3264 [RFC3264]. 
     
     
 5.5      Offerer Processing of the Answer 
     
     
    The answer to a loopback-source MUST be loopback-mirror.  The 
    answer to a loopback-mirror MUST be loopback-source.  The 
    loopback-mode line MUST contain at least one codec the answerer is 
    willing to send or receive depending on whether it is the loopback-
    source or the loopback-mirror. In addition, the "m=" line MUST 
    contain at least one codec that the answerer is willing to send or 
    receive depending on whether it is the loopback-mirror or the 
    loopback-source.  
    If the answer does not contain a=loopback-mirror or 
    a=loopback-source or contains any other standard mode attributes, 
    it is assumed that the loopback extensions are not supported by the 
    target UA. 
     
     
 5.6      Modifying the Session 
     
     
    At any point during the loopback session, either participant may 
    issue a new offer to modify the characteristics of the previous 
    session.  In case of SIP this is defined in section 8 of RFC 3264 
    [RFC3264].  This also includes transitioning from a normal media 
    processing mode to loopback mode, and vice a versa.

    In certain scenarios it is possible that the media transmitted by 
    the loopback-source is blocked by a network element until the 
    loopback-mirror starts transmitting packets. One example of this 
    scenario is the presence of an RTP relay in the path of the media.  
    RTP relays exist in VoIP networks for purpose of NAT and Firewall 
    traversal.  If an RTP relay is present, the loopback-source's 
    packets are dropped by the RTP relay until the loopback-mirror has 
    started transmitting media and the media state within the RTP relay 
    is established.  This results in a chicken and egg scenario as the 
    looback-mirror cannot transmit any media until it receives the 
    media packets from the loopback-source but for the loopback-mirror 
    to receive any packets it needs to send one first. In order to 
    resolve this dilemma, Section 8 introduces a new payload type whose 
    sole purpose is to establish the media state in the intermediate 
    devices. In the presence of this payload type, the loopback-mirror 
    will transmit media according to the payload description until it 
    receives media from the loopback-source.  The loopback-mirror MAY 
    include this payload type in the answer if it is not present in the 
    offer.  This may be necessary if the loopback-mirror is aware of 
    NAT's, firewalls, or RTP relays on the path of the call. In this 
    case the loopback-source MUST accept media corresponding to this 
    payload type.  After the first media packet is received from the 
    loopback-source, the loopback-mirror MUST terminate the 
    transmission of media for this payload type and MUST start looping 
    back media as defined by the other loopback attributes present in 
    the offer.   
     
     
     
 6.     RTP Requirements 
     
     
    An answering entity that is compliant to this specification and 
    accepting a media with rtp-pkt-loopback loopback-type MUST loopback 
    the incoming RTP packets using either the encapsulated RTP payload 
    format or the direct loopback RTP payload format as defined in 
    section 7 of this specification.  
     
    An answering entity that is compliant to this specification and 
    accepting a media with rtp-media-loopback loopback-type MUST 
    transmit all received media back to the sender. The incoming media 
    MUST be treated as if it were to be played (e.g. the media stream 
    MAY receive treatment from PLC algorithms).  The answering entity 
    MUST re-generate all the RTP header fields as it would when 
    transmitting media. The answering entity MAY choose to encode the 
    loopback media according to any of the media descriptions supported 
    by the offering entity. Furthermore, in cases where the same media 
    type is looped back, the answering entity MAY choose to preserve

    number of frames/packet and bitrate of the encoded media according 
    to the received media. 
     
     
 7.     Payload formats for Packet loopback 
  
     
    The payload formats described in this section MUST be used by a 
    loopback-mirror when rtp-pkt-loopback is the specified 
    loopback-type.  Two different formats are specified here - an 
    encapsulated RTP payload format and a direct loopback RTP payload 
    format.  The encapsulated RTP payload format should be used when 
    the incoming RTP header information needs to be preserved during 
    the loopback operation.  This is useful in cases where loopback 
    source needs to measure performance metrics in both directions. 
    However, this comes at the expense of increased packet size as 
    described in section 7.1.  The direct loopback RTP payload format 
    should be used when bandwidth requirement prevent the use of 
    encapsulated RTP payload format. 
     
     
 7.1      Encapsulated Payload format 
     
     
    A received RTP packet is encapsulated in the payload section of the 
    RTP packet generated by a loopback-mirror.  Each received packet 
    MUST be encapsulated in a different packet, the encapsulated packet 
    MAY be fragmented only if required (for example: due to MTU 
    limitations). 
     
     
 7.1.1 Usage of RTP Header fields 
     
     
    Payload Type (PT): The assignment of an RTP payload type for this 
    packet format is outside the scope of this document; it is either 
    specified by the RTP profile under which this payload format is 
    used or more likely signaled dynamically out-of-band (e.g., using 
    SDP; section 7.1.3 defines the name binding). 
     
    Marker (M) bit: If the received RTP packet is looped back in 
    multiple RTP packets, the M bit is set to 1 in the last packet, 
    otherwise it is set to 0. 
     
    Extension (X) bit: Defined by the RTP Profile used. 
     
    Sequence Number: The RTP sequence number SHOULD be generated by the 
    loopback-mirror in the usual manner with a constant random offset 
    as described in RFC 3550 [RFC3550].

    Timestamp: The RTP timestamp denotes the sampling instant for when 
    the loopback-mirror is transmitting this packet to the loopback-
    source.  The RTP timestamp MUST use the same clock rate used by the 
    loopback-source. The initial value of the timestamp SHOULD be 
    random for security reasons (see Section 5.1 of RFC 3550 
    [RFC3550]). 
     
    SSRC: set as described in RFC 3550 [RFC3550]. 
     
    CC and CSRC fields are used as described in RFC 3550 [RFC3550].  
     
     
 7.1.2 RTP Payload Structure 
     
     
    The RTP header in the encapsulated packet MUST be followed by the 
    payload header defined in this section. If the received RTP packet 
    has to be looped back in multiple packets due to fragmentation, the 
    RTP header in each packet MUST be followed by the payload header 
    defined in this section.  The header is devised so that the 
    loopback-source can usefully decode looped back packets in the 
    presence of moderate packet loss [RFC3550].

    Receive Timestamp: 32 bits 
     
    The Receive timestamp denotes the sampling instant for when the

    by the loopback-mirror is received from the loopback-source.  The 
    Receive timestamp MUST be based on the same clock used by the

    loopback-source.  The initial value of the timestamp SHOULD be 
    random for security reasons (see Section 5.1 of RFC 3550 
    [RFC3550]). 
     
    Fragmentation (F): 2 bits 
     
    First Fragment (00) /Last Fragment (01) /No Fragmentation(10)/ 
    Intermediate Fragment (11).  This field identifies how much of the 
    received packet is encapsulated in this packet by the loopback-
    mirror.  If the received packet is not fragmented, this field is 
    set to 10; otherwise the packet that contains the first fragments 
    sets this field to 00, the packet that contains the last fragment 
    sets this field to 01, all other packets set this field to 11. 
     
    Reserved: 2 bits 
     
    This field is reserved for future definition. In the absence of 
    such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and 
    MUST be ignored by the receiver. 
     
    Any padding octets in the original packet MUST not be included in 
    the loopback packet generated by a loopback-mirror. The 
    loopback-mirror MAY add padding octets if required. 
     
     
 7.1.3 Usage of SDP 
     
     
    The payload type number for the encapsulated stream can be 
    negotiated using a mechanism like SDP. There is no static payload 
    type assignment for the encapsulated stream, so dynamic payload 
    type numbers MUST be used.  The binding to the name is indicated by 
    an rtpmap attribute.  The name used in this binding is "encaprtp". 
     
    The following is an example SDP fragment for encapsulated RTP. 
     
    m=audio 41352 RTP/AVP 112 
    a=rtpmap:112 encaprtp/8000 
     
     
 7.2      Direct loopback RTP payload format 
     
     
    The direct loopback RTP payload format can be used in scenarios 
    where the 16 byte overhead of the encapsulated payload format is 
    significant.  This payload format MUST not be used in cases where 
    the MTU on the loopback path is less than the MTU on the transmit 
    path.  When using this payload format, the receiver MUST loop back 
    each received packet in a separate RTP packet.

    specified by the RTP profile under which this payload format is 
    used or more likely signaled dynamically out-of-band (e.g., using 
    SDP; section 7.2.3 defines the name binding). 
     
    Marker (M) bit: Set to the value in the received packet. 
     
    Extension (X) bit: Defined by the RTP Profile used. 
     
    Sequence Number: The RTP sequence number SHOULD be generated by the 
    loopback-mirror in the usual manner with a constant random offset. 
     
    Timestamp: The RTP timestamp denotes the sampling instant for when 
    the loopback-mirror is transmitting this packet to the 
    loopback-source.  The RTP timestamp MUST be based on the same clock 
    used by the loopback-source.  The initial value of the timestamp 
    SHOULD be random for security reasons (see Section 5.1 of RFC 3550 
    [RFC3550]). 
     
    SSRC: set as described in RFC 3550 [RFC3550]. 
     
    CC and CSRC fields are used as described in RFC 3550 [RFC3550].  
     
  
  
 7.2.2 RTP Payload Structure 
     
     
    This payload format does not define any payload specific headers. 
    The loopback-mirror simply copies the payload data from the payload 
    portion of the packet received from the loopback-source. 
     
     
 7.2.3 Usage of SDP 
     
     
    The payload type number for the payload loopback stream can be 
    negotiated using a mechanism like SDP. There is no static payload 
    type assignment for the stream, so dynamic payload type numbers 
    MUST be used. The binding to the name is indicated by an rtpmap 
    attribute.  The name used in this binding is "rtploopback". 
     
    The following is an example SDP fragment for encapsulated RTP.

 8.     Payload format for Priming the Loopback Pump 
  
     
    The sole purpose of the payload format described in this section is 
    to prime the loopback pump in cases where the loopback process 
    cannot start because of intermediate devices in the network as 
    described in Section 5.7. 
     
     
 8.1      Usage of RTP Header fields 
     
  
     
    Payload Type (PT): The assignment of an RTP payload type for this 
    packet format is outside the scope of this document; it is either 
    specified by the RTP profile under which this payload format is 
    used or more likely signaled dynamically out-of-band (e.g., using 
    SDP; section 8.2 defines the name binding). 
     
    All other fields are set as described in RFC 3550 [RFC3550]. 
     
 8.2      Usage of SDP 
     
     
    The payload type number for the loopback primer stream can be 
    negotiated using a mechanism like SDP. There is no static payload 
    type assignment for the loopback primer stream, so dynamic payload 
    type numbers MUST be used.  The binding to the name is indicated by 
    an rtpmap attribute.  The name used in this binding is 
    "loopbkprimer".

    The use of the loopback attribute is intended for monitoring of 
    media quality of the session.  Consequently the media performance 
    information should be exchanged between the offering and the 
    answering entities.  An offering or answering entity that is

    compliant to this specification SHOULD support RTCP per [RFC3550] 
    and RTCP-XR per RFC 3611 [RFC3611].  Furthermore, if the client or 
    the server choose to support RTCP-XR,  they SHOULD support RTCP-XR 
    Loss RLE report block, Duplicate RLE report block, Statistics 
    Summary report block, and VoIP Metric Reports Block per sections 
    4.1, 4.2, 4.6, and 4.7 of  RFC 3611 [RFC3611].  The client and the 
    server MAY support other RTCP-XR reporting blocks as defined by RFC 
    3611 [RFC3611]. 
     
 10.      Congestion Control 
  
  
    All the participants in a loopback session SHOULD implement 
    congestion control mechanisms as defined by the RTP profile under 
    which the loopback mechanism is implemented. For audio video 
    profiles, implementations SHOULD conform to the mechanism defined 
    in Section 2 of RFC 3551.  
     
     
 11.      Examples  
  
  
    This section provides examples for media descriptions using SDP for 
    different scenarios.  The examples are given for SIP-based 
    transactions and are abbreviated and do not show the complete 
    signaling for convenience.

    that media loopback may be automated without the end user's 
    knowledge, the server of the media loopback should be aware of

    denial of service attacks. It is recommended that sessions with 
    media loopback are authenticated and the frequency of such sessions 
    is limited by the server.  
     
     
 13.      Implementation Considerations 
  
    The media loopback approach described in this document is a 
    complete solution that would work under all scenarios. However, it 
    is believed that the solution may not be light-weight enough for 
    the common case. In light of this concern, this section clarifies 
    which features of the loopback proposal MUST be implemented for all 
    implementations and which features MAY be deferred if the complete 
    solution is not desired. 
     
    All implementations MUST support the rtp-pkt-loopback option for 
    loopback-type attribute. In addition, for the loopback-mode 
    attribute, all implementations of an offerer MUST at a minimum be 
    able to act as a loopback-source. All implementation MUST also at a 
    minimum support the direct media loopback payload type. The rtp-
    media-loopback attribute MAY be implemented in complete 
    implementations of this draft.  
     
     
 14.      IANA Considerations 
  
  
 14.1       SDP Attributes 
     
     
    This document defines three new media-level SDP attributes.  IANA 
    has registered the following attributes: 
     
       Contact name:             Kaynam Hedayat 
    <kaynam.hedayat@exfo.com>. 
       Attribute name:           "loopback". 
       Type of attribute:        Media level. 
       Subject to charset:       No. 
       Purpose of attribute:     The 'loopback' attribute is used to  
                                 indicate the type of media loopback. 
       Allowed attribute values: The parameters to 'loopback' may be 
                                 one or more of "rtp-pkt-loopback" and 
                                 "rtp-media-loopback". See section 5 
                                 of this document for syntax. 
     
       Contact name:             Kaynam Hedayat 
    <kaynam.hedayat@exfo.com>. 
       Attribute name:           "loopback-source". 
       Type of attribute:        Media level.

 Internet-Draft            SDP Media Loopback               Januar 2010 
  
       Subject to charset:       No. 
       Purpose of attribute:     The 'loopback-source' attribute  
                                 specifies that the sender is the media  
                                 source and expects the receiver to act  
                                 as a loopback-mirror. 
       Allowed attribute values: The parameter to 'loopback-source' is 
                                 a media format ("<fmt>") description 
                                 as defined in RFC 4566 Section 5.14. 
     
       Contact name:             Kaynam Hedayat 
    <kaynam.hedayat@exfo.com>. 
       Attribute name:           "loopback-mirror". 
       Type of attribute:        Media level. 
       Subject to charset:       No. 
       Purpose of attribute:     The 'loopback-mirror' attribute 
                                 specifies that the receiver will  
                                 mirror (echo) all received media back  
                                 to the sender of the RTP stream. 
       Allowed attribute values: The parameter to 'loopback-mirror' is 
                                 a media format ("<fmt>") description 
                                 as defined in RFC 4566 Section 5.14.

           Intended usage: COMMON 
     
           Restrictions on usage: This media type depends on RTP 
                framing, and hence is only defined for transfer via 
                RTP. Transfer within other framing protocols is not 
                defined at this time.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <section title="Introduction to White Space">
        <t>Wireless spectrum is a commodity that is regulated by governments.
        The spectrum is used for various purposes, which include, but are not
        limited to, entertainment (e.g., radio and television), communication
        (e.g., telephony and Internet access), military (e.g., radars etc.),
        and navigation (e.g., satellite communication, GPS). Portions of the
        radio spectrum that are assigned to a licensed (primary) user but are
        unused or unoccupied at specific locations and times are defined as
        "white space." The concept of allowing additional (secondary)
        transmissions (which may or may not be licensed) in white space is a
        technique to "unlock" existing spectrum for new use.</t>

        <t>An obvious requirement is that these secondary transmissions do not
        interfere with the assigned use of the spectrum. One interesting
        observation is that often, in a given physical location, the primary
        user(s) may not be using the entire band assigned to them. The
        available spectrum for secondary transmissions would then depend on
        the location of the secondary user. The fundamental issue is how to
        determine, for a specific location and specific time, if any of the
        assigned spectrum is available for secondary use.</t>

        <t>Academia and Industry have studied multiple <eref
        target="http://fcc.gov/oet/cognitiveradio/">cognitive radio</eref>
        mechanisms for use in such a scenario. One simple mechanism is to use
        a geospatial database that contains the spatial and temporal profile
        of all primary licensees' spectrum usage, and require secondary users
        to query the database for available spectrum that they can use at
        their location. Such databases can be accessible and queryable by
        secondary users on the Internet.</t>

        <t>Any entity that is assigned spectrum that is not densely used may
        be asked by a governmental regulatory agency to share it to allow for
        more intensive use of the spectrum. Providing a mechanism by which
        secondary users share the spectrum with the primary user is attractive
        in many bands in many countries.</t>

        <t>This document includes the problem statement followed by use cases
        and requirements associated with the use of white-space spectrum by
        secondary users via a database query protocol. The final sections
        include the requirements associated with such a protocol. Note that
        the IETF has undertaken to develop a database query protocol (see
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-paws-protocol"/>).</t>

        <section title="In Scope">
          <t>This document covers the requirements for a protocol to allow a

          following actions:<list style="numbers">
              <t>Determine the relevant database to query.</t>

              <t>Connect to and optionally register with the database using a

              <t>Receive in response to the query a list of available

            </list>Note. The above protocol actions should explicitly or
          implicitly support the ability of devices to re-register and/or
          re-query the database when they change their locations or operating
          parameters. This will allow them to receive permission to operate in
          their new locations and/or with their new operating parameters, and
          to send acknowledgments to the database that include information on

    <section title="Problem Statement">
      <t>The use of white-space spectrum is enabled via the capability of a
      device to query a database and obtain information about the availability

      the Internet and the devices querying these databases are expected to
      have some form of Internet connectivity, directly or indirectly. While
      databases are expected to support the rule set(s) of one or more
      regulatory domains, and the regulations and available spectrum
      associated with each rule set may vary, the fundamental operation of the

      <t/>

      <t>Note that there could be multiple databases serving white space
      devices. In some countries, such as the U.S., the regulator has
      determined that multiple databases may provide service to White Space
      Devices.</t>

      <t>A messaging interface between the white space devices and the
      database is required for operating a network using the white-space
      spectrum. The following sections discuss various aspects of such an
      interface and the need for a standard.</t>

      <section title="Global Applicability">
        <t>The use of white-space spectrum is currently approved or being
        considered in multiple regulatory domains, whose rules may differ.
        However, the need for devices that intend to use the spectrum to
        communicate with a database remains a common feature. The database
        implements rules that protect all primary users, independent of the
        characteristics of the white space devices. It also provides a way to
        specify a schedule of use, since some primary users (for example,
        wireless microphones) only operate in limited time slots.</t>

        <t>Devices need to be able to query a database, directly or
        indirectly, over the public Internet and/or private IP networks prior
        to operating in available spectrum. Information about available
        spectrum, schedule, power, etc., are provided by the database as a
        response to the query from a device. The messaging interface needs to
        be:<list style="numbers">
            <t>Interface agnostic - An interface between a master white space
            device and database can be wired or unwired (e.g., a radio/air
            interface technology such as IEEE 802.11af, IEEE 802.15.4m, IEEE
            802.16, IEEE 802.22, LTE etc.) However, the messaging interface
            between a master white space device and the database should be
            agnostic to the interface used for such messaging while being
            cognizant of the characteristics of the interface technology and
            the need to include any relevant attributes in the query to the
            database.</t>

            <t>Spectrum agnostic - the spectrum used by primary and secondary
            users varies by country. Some spectrum has an explicit notion of a
            "channel": a defined swath of spectrum within a band that has some
            assigned identifier. Other spectrum bands may be subject to white
            space sharing, but only have actual frequency low/high parameters
            to define primary and secondary use. The protocol should be able
            to be used in any spectrum band where white space sharing is
            permitted.</t>

            <t>Globally applicable - A common messaging interface between
            white space devices and databases will enable the use of such
            spectrum for various purposes on a global basis. Devices can
            operate in any location where such spectrum is available and a
            common interface ensures uniformity in implementations and
            deployment. To allow the global use of white space devices in
            different countries (whatever the regulatory domain), the protocol
            should support the database communicating applicable regulatory
            rule set information to the white space device.</t>

            <t>Flexible and extensible data structures - Different databases
            are likely to have different requirements for the kinds of data
            required for registration (different regulatory rule sets that
            apply to the registration of devices) and other messages sent by
            the device to the database. For instance, different regulators
            might require different device-characteristic information to be
            passed to the database.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="SectDBDiscovery" title="Database Discovery">
        <t>The master device must obtain the address of a trusted database,
        which it will query for available white-space spectrum. If the master
        device uses a discovery service to locate a trusted database, it may
        perform the following steps (this description is intended as
        descriptive, not prescriptive):<list style="numbers">
            <t>The master device constructs and sends a request (e.g., over
            the Internet) to a trusted discovery service.</t>

            <t>If no acceptable response is received within a pre-configured
            time limit, the master device concludes that no trusted database
            is available. If at least one response is received, the master
            device evaluates the response(s) to determine if a trusted
            database can be identified where the master device is able to
            receive service from the database. If so, it establishes contact
            with the trusted database.</t>

            <t>The master device establishes a white space network as
            described in <xref target="SectUseCases"/>.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Optionally, and in place of steps 1-2 above, the master device can
        be pre-configured with the address (e.g., URI) of one or more trusted
        databases. The master device can establish contact with one of these
        trusted databases.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="SectDeviceRegistration" title="Device Registration">
        <t>The master device may register with the database before it queries
        the database for available spectrum. A registration process may
        consist of the following steps:<list style="numbers">
            <t>The master device sends registration information to the
            database. This information may include the Device ID, serial
            number assigned by the manufacturer, device location, device
            antenna height above ground, name of the individual or business
            that owns the device, and the name, street and email address, and
            telephone number of a contact person responsible for the device's
            operation.</t>

            <t>The database responds to the registration request with an
            acknowledgement to indicate the success of the registration
            request or with an error if the registration was unsuccessful.
            Additional information may be provided by the database in its
            response to the master device.</t>

      <section title="Protocol">
        <t>A protocol that enables a white space device to query a database to
        obtain information about available spectrum is needed. A device may be
        required to register with the database with some credentials prior to
        being allowed to query. The requirements for such a protocol are
        specified in this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Data Model Definition">
        <t>The contents of the queries and response need to be specified. A
        data model is required which enables the white space device to query
        the database while including all the relevant information such as
        geolocation, radio technology, power characteristics, etc., which may
        be country and spectrum and regulatory dependent. All databases are
        able to interpret the data model and respond to the queries using the
        same data model that is understood by all devices.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="SectUseCases" title="Use Cases">
      <t>There are many potential use cases for white-space spectrum - for
      example, providing broadband Internet access in urban and
      densely-populated hotspots as well as rural and remote, underserved
      areas. Available white-space spectrum may also be used to provide
      Internet 'backhaul' for traditional Wi-Fi hotspots or for use by towns
      and cities to monitor/control traffic lights, read utility meters, and
      the like. Still other use cases include the ability to offload data
      traffic from another Internet access network (e.g., 3G cellular network)
      or to deliver data, information, or a service to a user based on the
      user's location. Some of these use cases are described in the following
      sections.</t>

      <section anchor="SectMasterSlaveUse"
               title="Master-slave White Space Networks">
        <t>There are a number of common scenarios in which a master white
        space device will act as proxy or mediator for one or more slave
        devices using its connection to the Internet to query the database for
        available spectrum for itself and for one or more slave devices. These
        slave devices may be fixed or mobile, in close proximity with each
        other (indoor network or urban hotspot), or at a distance (rural or
        remote WAN). Once slave devices switch to white-space spectrum for
        their communications, they may connect through the master to the
        Internet or use white-space spectrum for intra-network communications
        only. The master device can continue to arbitrate and control white
        space communications by slave devices, and may notify them when they
        are required to change white-space frequencies or cease white space
        communications.</t>

        <t><xref target="fig2"/> depicts the general architecture of such a
        simple master-slave network, in which the master device communicates
        on its own behalf and on behalf of slave devices with a database.</t>

        <t/>

        <t>The protocol requirements for these master-slave device and other
        similar scenarios is essentially the same: the protocol must support
        the ability of a master device to make available-spectrum query
        requests on behalf of slave devices, passing device identification,
        geolocation, and other slave device parameters to the database as
        required to obtain a list of white-space spectrum available for use by
        one or more slave devices. Of course, different use cases will use
        this spectrum information in different ways, and the details of
        master/slave communications may be different for different use
        cases.</t>

        <t>Common steps may occur in master-slave networks include the
        following:<list style="numbers">
            <t>The master device powers up.</t>

            <t>Slave devices may power up and associate with the master device
            via Wi-Fi or some other over-the-air non-white-space spectrum.
            Until the slave device is allocated white-space spectrum, any
            master-slave or slave-slave communications occurs over such
            non-white-space spectrum.</t>

            <t>The master has Internet connectivity, determines (or knows) its
            location, and establishes a connection to a trusted database (see
            <xref target="SectDBDiscovery"/>).</t>

            <t>The master may register with the trusted database (see <xref
            target="SectDeviceRegistration"/>).</t>

            <t>The master sends a query to the trusted database requesting a
            list of available white-space spectrum based upon its geolocation.
            Query parameters may include the master's location, device
            identifier, and antenna height. The master may send
            available-spectrum requests to the database on behalf of slave
            devices.</t>

            <t>The database responds to the master's query with a list of
            available white-space spectrum, associated maximum power levels,
            and a durations of time for spectrum use. If the master made
            requests on behalf of slave devices, the master may transmit the
            obtained available-spectrum lists to the slaves (or the master may
            allocate spectrum to slaves from the obtained spectrum lists).</t>

            <t>The master may inform the database of the spectrum and power
            level it selects from the available spectrum list. If a slave
            device has been allocated available white-space spectrum, the
            slave may inform the master of the spectrum and power level it has
            chosen, and the master may, in turn, relay such slave device usage
            to the database.</t>

            <t>Further communication among masters and slaves over the white
            space network may occur via the selected/allocated white-space
            spectrum frequencies.</t>
          </list>Note: Steps 5 through 7 may be repeated by the master device
        when it (or a slave device that uses the master as a proxy to
        communicate with the database) changes its location or operating
        parameters -- for example, after a master changes location, it may
        query the database for available spectrum at its new location, then
        acknowledge the subsequent response received from the database with
        information on the spectrum and power levels it is using at the new
        location.</t>

      <section title="Rapid Network Deployment During Emergencies">
        <t>Organizations involved in handling emergency operations maintain an
        infrastructure that relies on dedicated spectrum for their operations.
        However, such infrastructures are often affected by the disasters they
        handle. To set up a replacement network, spectrum needs to be quickly
        cleared and reallocated to the crisis response organization.
        Automation of the this allocation and assignment is often the best
        solution. A preferred option is to make use of a robust protocol that
        has been adopted and implemented by radio manufacturers. A typical
        network topology solution might include wireless access links to the
        public Internet or private network, wireless ad-hoc network radios
        working independent of a fixed infrastructure, and satellite links for
        backup where lack of coverage, overload, or outage of wireless access
        links can occur.</t>

        <t>In the ad-hoc network, all nodes are master nodes that allocate RF
        channels from the database (as described in <xref
        target="SectMasterSlaveUse"/>). However, the backhaul link may not be
        available to all nodes, such as depicted for the left node in the
        above figure. To handle RF channel allocation for such nodes, a master
        node with a backhaul link relays or proxies the database query for
        them. So master nodes without a backhaul link follow the procedure as
        defined for clients. The ad-hoc network radios utilize the provided RF
        channels. Details on forming and maintenance of the ad-hoc network,
        including repair of segmented networks caused by segments operating on
        different RF channels, is out of scope of spectrum allocation.</t>

      <t>PAWS is a protocol whereby a Master Device requests a schedule of
      available spectrum at its location (or location of its Slave Devices)
      before it (they) can operate using those frequencies. Whereas the
      information provided by the Database must be accurate and conform to
      applicable regulatory rules, the Database cannot enforce, through the
      protocol, that a client device uses only the spectrum it provided. In
      other words, devices can put energy in the air and cause interference
      without asking the Database. Hence, PAWS security considerations do not
      include protection against malicious use of the white-space
      spectrum.</t>

              that an attacker has full access to the network medium between
              the master device and the database. The attacker may be able to

              obtain information about available spectrum. Without suitable

              that is not available at a location or may transmit at a greater
              power level than allowed. Such unauthorized use can result in
              interference to the primary user of that spectrum.
              Alternatively, an attacker may modify a database response to
              indicate that no spectrum is available at a location (or jam the

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document provides guidelines for the design of Remote
   Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) attributes both within
   the IETF as well as within other SDOs.  By articulating RADIUS design
   guidelines, it is hoped that this document will encourage the
   development and publication of high quality RADIUS attribute
   specifications.

   However, the advice in this document will not be helpful unless it is
   put to use.  As with "Guidelines for Authors and Reviewers of MIB
   Documents" [RFC4181], it is expected that this document will be used
   by authors to check their document against the guidelines prior to
   publication, or requesting review (such as an "Expert Review"
   described in [RFC3575]).  Similarly, it is expected that this
   document will be used by reviewers (such as WG participants or the
   AAA Doctors [DOCTORS]), resulting in an improvement in the
   consistency of reviews.

   In order to meet these objectives, this document needs to cover not
   only the science of attribute design, but also the art.  Therefore,
   in addition to covering the most frequently encountered issues, this
   document explains some of the considerations motivating the
   guidelines.  These considerations include complexity trade-offs that
   make it difficult to provide "hard and fast" rules for attribute
   design.  This document explains those trade-offs through reviews of
   current attribute usage.

   The rest of the document is organized as follows.  Section 1
   discusses the applicability of the guidelines and defines a
   recommended review process for RADIUS specifications.  Section 2
   defines the design guidelines in terms of what is "RECOMMENDED" and
   "NOT RECOMMENDED".  Section 3 gives a longer explanation of the
   rationale behind the guidelines given in the previous section.
   Appendix A repeats the guidelines in a "checklist" format.  Appendix
   B discusses previously defined attributes which do not follow the
   guidelines.

   Authors of new RADIUS specifications can be compliant with the design
   guidelines by working through the checklists given in Appendix A.
   Reviewers of RADIUS spcifications are expected to be familiar with
   the entire document.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:





Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                 [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


Network Access Server (NAS)
     A device that provides an access service for a user to a network.

RADIUS server
     A RADIUS authentication, authorization, and/or accounting (AAA)
     server is an entity that provides one or more AAA services to a
     NAS.

standard space
     Codes in the RADIUS Attribute Type Space which are allocated by
     IANA and which follow the format defined in RFC 2865 [RFC2865]
     Section 5.

vendor space
     The contents of the "String" field of a Vendor-Specific Attribute
     (VSA), as defined in [RFC2865] Section 5.26.  These attributes
     provide a unique attribute type space for each vendor (identified
     by the Vendor-Type field) which they can self-allocate.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.3.  Applicability

   The advice in this document applies to RADIUS attributes used to
   encode service-provisioning, authentication, or accounting data,
   based on the attribute encodings and data formats defined in RFC 2865
   [RFC2865], RFC 2866 [RFC2866] and subsequent RADIUS RFCs.

   Since this document represents a Best Current Practice, it does not
   update or deprecate existing standards.  As a result, uses of the
   terms "MUST" and "MUST NOT" are limited to requirements already
   present in existing documents.

   It is RECOMMENDED that these guidelines be followed for all new
   RADIUS specifications, whether they originate from a vendor, an SDO,
   or the IETF.  Doing so will ensure the widest possible applicability
   and interoperability of the specifications, while requiring minimal
   changes to existing systems.  In particular, it is expected that
   RADIUS specifications requesting allocation within the standard space
   will follow these guidelines, and will explain why this is not
   possible if they cannot.

   However, there are situations in which vendors or SDOs can choose not
   to follow these guidelines without major consequences.  As noted in



Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                 [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


   [RFC2865] Section 5.26, Vendor-Specific Attributes (VSAs) are
   "available to allow vendors to support their own extended Attributes
   not suitable for general usage."  Where vendors or SDOs develop
   specifications "not suitable for general usage", limited
   interoperability and inability to use existing implementations may be
   acceptable and in these situations, vendors and SDOs MAY choose to
   not conform to these guidelines.

   Note that the RADEXT WG is currently (as of 2010) involved in
   developing updates to RADIUS.  Those updates will provide their own
   usage guidelines that may modify some of the guidelines defined here,
   such as defining new data types, practices, etc.

   RADIUS protocol changes, or specification of attributes (such as
   Service-Type) that can, in effect, provide new RADIUS commands
   require greater expertise and deeper review, as do changes to the
   RADIUS operational model.  As a result, such changes are outside the
   scope of this document and MUST NOT be undertaken outside the IETF.

1.3.1.  Reviews

   For specifications utilizing attributes within the standard space,
   conformance with the design guidelines in this document is expected
   unless a good case can be made for an exception.  Reviewers SHOULD
   use the design guidelines as a review checklist.

   While not required, IETF review may also be beneficial for
   specifications utilizing the Vendor-Specific space. Experience has
   shown that attributes not originally designed for general usage can
   subsequently garner wide-spread deployment.  An example is the
   vendor-specific attributes defined in [RFC2548], which have been
   widely implemented within IEEE 802.11 Access Points.

   In order to assist in the development of specifications conforming to
   these guidelines, authors can request review by sending email to the
   AAA Doctors [DOCTORS] or equivalent mailing list.  The IETF
   Operations & Management Area Directors will then arrange for the
   review to be completed and posted to the AAA Doctors mailing list
   [DOCTORS], RADEXT WG mailing list, or other IETF mailing list.  Since
   reviews are handled by volunteers, responses are provided on a best-
   effort basis, with no service level guarantees.  Authors are
   encouraged to seek review as early as possible, so as to avoid
   potential delays.

   As reviewers require access to the specification, vendors and SDOs
   are encouraged to make them publicly available.  Where the RADIUS
   specification is embedded within a larger document which cannot be
   made public, the RADIUS attribute and value definitions can be made



Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                 [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


   available on a public web site or can be published as an
   Informational RFC, as with [RFC4679].

   The review process requires neither allocation of attributes within
   the IETF standard attribute space nor publication of an IETF RFC.
   Requiring SDOs or vendors to rehost VSAs into the IETF standards
   attribute space solely for the purpose of obtaining review would put
   pressure on the standards space, and may be harmful to
   interoperability, since would create two ways to provision the same
   service.  Rehosting may also require changes to the RADIUS data model
   which will affect implementations that do not intend to support the
   SDO or vendor specifications.

   Similarly, vendors are encouraged to make their specifications
   publicly available, for maximum interoperability.  However, it is not
   necessary for a vendor to request publication of a VSA specification
   as an Informational RFC by the IETF.

2.  Guidelines

   The RADIUS protocol as defined in [RFC2865] and [RFC2866] uses
   elements known as attributes in order to represent authentication,
   authorization and accounting data.

   Unlike SNMP, first defined in [RFC1157] and [RFC1155], RADIUS does
   not define a formal data definition language.  The data type of
   RADIUS attributes is not transported on the wire.  Rather, the data
   type of a RADIUS attribute is fixed when an attribute is defined.
   Based on the RADIUS attribute type code, RADIUS clients and servers
   can determine the data type based on preconfigured entries within a
   data dictionary.

   To explain the implications of this early RADIUS design decision, we
   distinguish two kinds of data types, namely "basic" and "complex".
   Basic data types use one of the existing RADIUS data types as defined
   in Section 2.1, encapsulated in a [RFC2865] RADIUS attribute, or in a
   [RFC2865] RADIUS VSA.  All other data formats are "complex types".

   RADIUS attributes can be classified into one of three broad
   categories:

      * Attributes that are of interest to a single vendor, e.g., for a
        product or product line.  Minimal cross-vendor interoperability
        is needed.

        Vendor-Specific Attributes (VSAs) are appropriate for use in
        this situation.  Code-point allocation is managed by the vendor
        with the number space defined by their Private Enterprise Number



Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                 [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


        (PEN).

      * Attributes that are of interest to an industry segment, where an
        SDO defines the attributes for that industry.  Multi-vendor
        interoperability within an industry segment is expected.

        Vendor-Specific Attributes (VSAs) MUST be used.  Code-point
        allocation is managed by the SDO with the number space defined
        by the SDOs PEN, rather then the PEN of an individual vendor.

      * Attributes that are of broad interest to the Internet Community.
        Multi-vendor interoperability is expected.

        Attributes within the standard space are appropriate for this
        purpose, and are allocated via IANA as described in [RFC3575].
        Since the standard space represents a finite resource, and is
        the only attribute space available for use by IETF working
        groups, vendors and SDOs are encouraged to utilize the VSA
        space, rather than requesting allocation of attributes from the
        standard space.  Usage of attribute type codes reserved for
        standard attributes is considered anti-social behavior and is
        strongly discouraged.

2.1.  Data Types

   RADIUS defines a limited set of data types, defined as "basic data
   types".  The following data qualifies as "basic data types":

      * 32-bit unsigned integer, in network byte order.

      * Enumerated data types, represented as a 32-bit unsigned integer
        with a list of name to value mappings.  (e.g. Service-Type)

      * IPv4 address in network byte order.

      * time as 32 bit unsigned value, in network byte order, and in
        seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970.

      * IPv6 address in network byte order.

      * Interface-Id (8 octet string in network byte order)

      * IPv6 prefix.

      * string (i.e., binary data), totalling 253 octets or less in
        length. This includes the opaque encapsulation of data
        structures defined outside of RADIUS.  See also Appendix A.1.3,
        below, for additional discussion.



Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                 [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


      * UTF-8 text [RFC3629], totalling 253 octets or less in length.

   Note that the length limitations for VSAs of type String and Text are
   less than 253 octets, due to the additional overhead of the Vendor-
   Specific encoding.

   The following data also qualifies as "basic data types":

      * Attributes grouped into a logical container, using the
        [RFC2868] tagging mechanism.  This approach is NOT RECOMMENDED
        (see Section 3.2.2), but is permissible where the alternatives
        are worse.

      * Attributes requiring the transport of more than 253 octets of
        Text or String data.  This includes the opaque encapsulation
        of data structures defined outside of RADIUS.
        (e.g. EAP-Message)

   All other data formats (including nested attributes) are defined to
   be "complex data types", and are NOT RECOMMENDED for normal use.
   Complex data types MAY be used in situations where they reduce
   complexity in non-RADIUS systems, or where using the basic data types
   would be awkward (such as where grouping would be required in order
   to link related attributes).  Since there are no "hard and fast"
   rules for where complexity is best located, each situation has to be
   decided on a case-by-case basis.  Examples of this tradeoff are
   discussed in Appendix B.  Where a complex data type is selected, an
   explanation SHOULD be offered as to why this was necessary.

2.2.  Vendor-Specific Attribute Space

   The Vendor-Specific Attribute space is defined to be the contents of
   the "String" field of the Vendor-Specific Attribute ([RFC2865]
   Section 5.26).  As discussed there, it is intended for vendors and
   SDOs to support their own attributes not suitable for general use.

   While the encoding of attributes within the vendor space is under the
   control of vendors and SDOs, following the guidelines described here
   is advantageous since it enables maximum interoperability with
   minimal changes to existing systems.

   For example, RADIUS server support for new attributes using "basic
   data types" can typically be accomplished by editing a RADIUS
   dictionary, whereas "complex data types" typically require RADIUS
   server code changes, which can add complexity and delays in
   implementation.

   Vendor RADIUS Attribute specifications SHOULD self-allocate



Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


   attributes from the vendor space, rather than requesting an
   allocation from within the RADIUS standard attribute space.

   VSA encodings that do not follow the [RFC2865] Section 5.26 encoding
   scheme are NOT RECOMMENDED.  Although [RFC2865] does not mandate it,
   implementations commonly assume that the Vendor Id can be used as a
   key to determine the on-the-wire encoding of a VSA.  Vendors
   therefore SHOULD NOT use multiple encodings for VSAs that are
   associated with a particular Vendor Id.  A vendor wishing to use
   multiple VSA encodings SHOULD request one Vendor Id for each VSA
   encoding that they will use.

2.3.  Service definitions and RADIUS

   RADIUS specifications define how an existing service or protocol can
   be provisioned using RADIUS, usually via the Service-Type attribute.
   Therefore, it is expected that a RADIUS attribute specification will
   reference documents defining the protocol or service to be
   provisioned.  Within the IETF, a RADIUS attribute specification
   SHOULD NOT be used to define the protocol or service being
   provisioned.  New services using RADIUS for provisioning SHOULD be
   defined elsewhere and referenced in the RADIUS specification.

   New attributes, or new values of existing attributes, SHOULD NOT be
   used to define new RADIUS commands.  RADIUS attributes are intended
   to:

      * authenticate users

      * authorize users (i.e., service provisioning or changes to
        provisioning)

      * account for user activity (i.e., logging of session activity)

   Requirements for allocation of new commands (i.e. the Code field in
   the packet header) and new attributes within the standard space are
   described in [RFC3575] Section 2.1.

2.4.  Translation of Vendor Specifications

   [RFC2865] Section 5.26 defines Vendor-Specific attributes as follows:

      This Attribute is available to allow vendors to support their own
      extended Attributes not suitable for general usage.  It MUST NOT
      affect the operation of the RADIUS protocol.

      Servers not equipped to interpret the vendor-specific information
      sent by a client MUST ignore it (although it may be reported).



Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                [Page 11]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


      Clients which do not receive desired vendor-specific information
      SHOULD make an attempt to operate without it, although they may do
      so (and report they are doing so) in a degraded mode.

   The limitation on changes to the RADIUS protocol effectively
   prohibits VSAs from changing fundamental aspects of RADIUS operation,
   such as modifying RADIUS packet sequences, or adding new commands.
   However, the requirement for clients and servers to be able to
   operate in the absence of VSAs has proven to be less of a constraint,
   since it is still possible for a RADIUS client and server to mutually
   indicate support for VSAs, after which behavior expectations can be
   reset.

   Therefore, RFC 2865 provides considerable latitude for development of
   new attributes within the vendor space, while prohibiting development
   of protocol variants.  This flexibility implies that RADIUS
   attributes can often be developed within the vendor space without
   loss (and possibly even with gain) in functionality.

   As a result, translation of RADIUS attributes developed within the
   vendor space into the standard space may provide only modest
   benefits, while accelerating the exhaustion of the standard attribute
   space.  We do not expect that all RADIUS attribute specifications
   requiring interoperability will be developed within the IETF, and
   allocated from the standard space.  A more scalable approach is to
   recognize the flexibility of the vendor space, while working toward
   improvements in the quality and availability of RADIUS attribute
   specifications, regardless of where they are developed.

   It is therefore NOT RECOMMENDED that specifications intended solely
   for use by a vendor or SDO use be translated into the standard space.

3.  Rationale

   This section outlines the rationale behind the above recommendations.

3.1.  RADIUS Operational Model

   The RADIUS operational model includes several assumptions:

      * The RADIUS protocol is stateless;

      * Provisioning of services is not possible within an
        Access-Reject or Disconnect-Request;

      * There is a distinction between authorization checks and user
        authentication;




Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                [Page 12]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


      * The protocol provides for authentication and integrity
        protection of packets;

      * The RADIUS protocol is a Request/Response protocol;

      * The protocol defines packet length restrictions.

   While RADIUS server implementations may keep state, the RADIUS
   protocol is stateless, although information may be passed from one
   protocol transaction to another via the State Attribute.  As a
   result, documents which require stateful protocol behavior without
   use of the State Attribute are inherently incompatible with RADIUS as
   defined in [RFC2865], and MUST be redesigned.  See [RFC5080] Section
   2.1.1 for additional discussion surrounding the use of the State
   Attribute.

   As noted in [RFC5080] Section 2.6, the intent of an Access-Reject is
   to deny access to the requested service.  As a result, RADIUS does
   not allow the provisioning of services within an Access-Reject or
   Disconnect-Request.  Documents which include provisioning of services
   within an Access-Reject or Disconnect-Request are inherently
   incompatible with RADIUS, and need to be redesigned.

   As noted in [RFC5176] Section 3:

      A Disconnect-Request MUST contain only NAS and session
      identification attributes.  If other attributes are included in a
      Disconnect- Request, implementations MUST send a Disconnect-NAK;
      an Error-Cause Attribute with value "Unsupported Attribute" MAY be
      included.

   As a result, documents which include provisioning of services within
   a Disconnect-Request are inherently incompatible with RADIUS, and
   need to be redesigned.

   As noted in [RFC5080] Section 2.1.1, a RADIUS Access-Request may not
   contain user authentication attributes or a State Attribute linking
   the Access-Request to an earlier user authentication.  Such an
   Access-Request, known as an authorization check, provides no
   assurance that it corresponds to a live user.  RADIUS specifications
   defining attributes containing confidential information (such as
   Tunnel-Password) should be careful to prohibit such attributes from
   being returned in response to an authorization check.  Also,
   [RFC5080] Section 2.1.1 notes that authentication mechanisms need to
   tie a sequence of Access-Request/Access-Challenge packets together
   into one authentication session.  The State Attribute is RECOMMENDED
   for this purpose.

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


   While [RFC2865] did not require authentication and integrity
   protection of RADIUS Access-Request packets, subsequent
   authentication mechanism specifications such as RADIUS/EAP [RFC3579]
   and Digest Authentication [RFC5090] have mandated authentication and
   integrity protection for certain RADIUS packets.  [RFC5080] Section
   2.1.1 makes this behavior RECOMMENDED for all Access-Request packets,
   including Access-Request packets performing authorization checks.  It
   is expected that specifications for new RADIUS authentication
   mechanisms will continue this practice.

   The RADIUS protocol as defined in [RFC2865] is a request-response
   protocol spoken between RADIUS clients and servers.  A single RADIUS
   request packet ([RFC2865], [RFC2866], or [RFC5176]) will solicit in
   response at most a single response packet, sent to the IP address and
   port of the RADIUS client that originated the request.  Changes to
   this model are likely to require major revisions to existing
   implementations and so this practice is NOT RECOMMENDED.

   The Length field in the RADIUS packet header is defined in [RFC2865]
   Section 3.  It is noted there that the maximum length of a RADIUS
   packet is 4096 octets.  As a result, attribute designers SHOULD NOT
   assume that a RADIUS implementation can successfully process RADIUS
   packets larger than 4096 octets.

   Even when packets are less than 4096 octets, they may be larger than
   the Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU).  Any packet larger than
   the PMTU will be fragmented, making communications more brittle as
   firewalls and filtering devices often discard fragments.  Transport
   of fragmented UDP packets appears to be a poorly tested code path on
   network devices.  Some devices appear to be incapable of transporting
   fragmented UDP packets, making it difficult to deploy RADIUS in a
   network where those devices are deployed.  We RECOMMEND that RADIUS
   messages be kept as small possible.

   If a situation is envisaged where it may be necessary to carry
   authentication, authorization or accounting data in a packet larger
   than 4096 octets, then one of the following approaches is
   RECOMMENDED:

     1. Utilization of a sequence of packets.
        For RADIUS authentication, a sequence of Access-Request/ Access-
        Challenge packets would be used.  For this to be feasible,
        attribute designers need to enable inclusion of attributes that
        can consume considerable space within Access-Challenge packets.
        To maintain compatibility with existing NASes, either the use of
        Access-Challenge packets needs to be permissible (as with
        RADIUS/EAP, defined in [RFC3579]), or support for receipt of an
        Access-Challenge needs to be indicated by the NAS (as in RADIUS



Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                [Page 14]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


        Location [RFC5580]). Also, the specification needs to clearly
        describe how attribute splitting is to be signalled and how
        attributes included within the sequence are to be interpreted,
        without requiring stateful operation.  Unfortunately, previous
        specifications have not always exhibited the required foresight.
        For example, even though very large filter rules are
        conceivable, the NAS-Filter-Rule Attribute defined in [RFC4849]
        is not permitted in an Access-Challenge packet, nor is a
        mechanism specified to allow a set of NAS-Filter-Rule attributes
        to be split across an Access-Request/Access-Challenge sequence.

        In the case of RADIUS accounting, transporting large amounts of
        data would require a sequence of Accounting-Request packets.
        This is a non-trivial change to RADIUS, since RADIUS accounting
        clients would need to be modified to split the attribute stream
        across multiple Accounting-Requests, and billing servers would
        need to be modified to re-assemble and interpret the attribute
        stream.

     2. Utilization of names rather than values.
        Where an attribute relates to a policy that could conceivably be
        pre-provisioned on the NAS, then the name of the pre-provisioned
        policy can be transmitted in an attribute, rather than the
        policy itself, which could be quite large.  An example of this
        is the Filter-Id Attribute defined in [RFC2865] Section 5.11,
        which enables a set of pre-provisioned filter rules to be
        referenced by name.

     3. Utilization of Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery
        techniques, as specified in [RFC4821].  As a last resort, where
        the above techniques cannot be made to work, it may be possible
        to apply the techniques described in [RFC4821] to discover the
        maximum supported RADIUS packet size on the path between a
        RADIUS client and a home server.  While such an approach can
        avoid the complexity of utilization of a sequence of packets,
        dynamic discovery is likely to be time consuming and cannot be
        guaranteed to work with existing RADIUS implementations.  As a
        result, this technique is not generally applicable.

3.2.  Data Model Issues

   While [RFC2865] Section 5 defines basic data types, later
   specifications did not follow this practice.  This problem has led
   implementations to define their own names for data types, resulting
   in non-standard names for those types.

   In addition, the number of vendors and SDOs creating new attributes
   within the Vendor-Specific attribute space has grown, and this has



Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                [Page 15]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


   led to some divergence in approaches to RADIUS attribute design.  For
   example, vendors and SDOs have evolved the data model to support
   functions such as new data types, along with attribute grouping and
   attribute fragmentation, with different groups taking different
   approaches.  These approaches are often incompatible, leading to
   additional complexity in RADIUS implementations.

   In order to avoid repeating old mistakes, this section describes the
   history of the RADIUS data model, and attempts to codify existing
   practices.

3.2.1.  Issues with Definitions of Types

   [RFC2865] Section 5 explicitly defines five data types: text, string,
   address, integer and time.  Both the names and interpretations of the
   types are given.

   Subsequent RADIUS specifications defined attributes by using type
   names not defined in [RFC2865], without defining the new names as
   done in [RFC2865].  They did not consistently indicate the format of
   the value field using the same conventions as [RFC2865].  As a
   result, the data type is ambiguous in some cases, and may not be
   consistent among different implementations.

   It is out of the scope of this document to resolve all potential
   ambiguities within existing RADIUS specifications.  However in order
   to prevent future ambiguities, it is RECOMMENDED that future RADIUS
   attribute specifications explicitly define newly created data types
   at the beginning of the document, and indicate clearly the data type
   to be used for each attribute.

   For example, [RFC3162] utilizes but does not explicitly define a type
   which encapsulates an IPv6 address (Section 2.1 and 2.4), and another
   type which encapsulates an IPv6 prefix (Section 2.3).  The IPv6
   address attributes confusingly are referenced as type "Address" in
   the document.  This is a similar name as the "address" type defined
   in [RFC2865], which was defined to refer solely to IPv4 addresses.

   While the Framed-Interface-Id attribute defined in [RFC3162] Section
   2.2 included a value field of 8 octets, the data type was not
   explicitly indicated, and therefore there is controversy over whether
   the format of the data was intended to be an 8 octet String or
   whether a special Interface-Id type was intended.

   Given that attributes encapsulating an IPv6 address and an IPv6
   prefix are already in use, it is RECOMMENDED that RADIUS server
   implementations include support for these as basic types, in addition
   to the types defined in [RFC2865].  Where the intent is to represent



Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                [Page 16]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


   a specific IPv6 address, an "IPv6 address" type SHOULD be used.
   Although it is possible to use an "IPv6 Prefix" type with a prefix
   length of 128 to represent an IPv6 address, this usage is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Implementations supporting the Framed-Interface-Id
   attribute may select a data type of their choosing (most likely an 8
   octet String or a special "Interface Id" data type).

   It is worth noting that since RADIUS only supports unsigned integers
   of 32 bits, attributes using signed integer data types or unsigned
   integer types of other sizes will require code changes, and SHOULD be
   avoided.

   For [RFC2865] RADIUS VSAs, the length limitation of the String and
   Text types is 247 octets instead of 253 octets, due to the additional
   overhead of the Vendor-Specific Attribute.


3.2.2.  Tagging Mechanism

   [RFC2868] defines an attribute grouping mechanism based on the use of
   a one octet tag value.  Tunnel attributes that refer to the same
   tunnel are grouped together by virtue of using the same tag value.

   This tagging mechanism has some drawbacks.  There are a limited
   number of unique tags (31).  The tags are not well suited for use
   with arbitrary binary data values, because it is not always possible
   to tell if the first byte after the Length is the tag or the first
   byte of the untagged value (assuming the tag is optional).

   Other limitations of the tagging mechanism are that when integer
   values are tagged, the value portion is reduced to three bytes
   meaning only 24-bit numbers can be represented.  The tagging
   mechanism does not offer an ability to create nested groups of
   attributes.  Some RADIUS implementations treat tagged attributes as
   having additional data types tagged-string and tagged-integer.  These
   types increase the complexity of implementing and managing RADIUS
   systems.

   For these reasons, the tagging scheme described in RFC 2868 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED for use as a generic grouping mechanism.

3.2.3.  Complex Data Types

   As described in this section, the creation of complex types can lead
   to interoperability and deployment issues, so they need to be
   introduced with care.  For example, the RADIUS attribute encoding is
   summarized in [RFC2865]:




Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                [Page 17]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


    0                   1                   2
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
   |     Type      |    Length     |  Value ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

   However, some standard attributes pack multiple sub-fields into the
   "Value" field, resulting in the creation a non-standard, i.e. complex
   type.  Separating these sub-fields into different attributes, each
   with its own type and length, would have the following benefits:

      * when manual data entry is required, it is easier for an
        administator to enter the data as well-known types, rather than
        as complex structures;

      * it enables additional error checking by leveraging the
        parsing and validation routines for well-known types;

      * it simplifies implementations by eliminating special-case
        attribute-specific parsing.

   One of the fundamental goals of the RADIUS protocol design was to
   allow RADIUS servers to be configured to support new attributes
   without requiring server code changes.  RADIUS server implementations
   typically provide support for basic data types, and define attributes
   in a data dictionary.  This architecture enables a new attribute to
   be supported by the addition of a dictionary entry, without requiring
   other RADIUS server code changes.

   Code changes can also be required in policy management systems and in
   the RADIUS server's receive path.  These changes are due to
   limitations in RADIUS server policy languages, which commonly provide
   for limited operations (such as comparisons or arithmetic operations)
   on the existing data types.  Many existing RADIUS policy languages
   typically are not capable of parsing sub-elements, or providing more
   sophisticated matching functionality.

   On the RADIUS client, code changes are typically required in order to
   implement a new attribute.  The RADIUS client typically has to
   compose the attribute dynamically when sending.  When receiving, a
   RADIUS client needs to be able to parse the attribute and carry out
   the requested service.  As a result, a detailed understanding of the
   new attribute is required on clients, and data dictionaries are less
   useful on clients than on servers.

   Given these limitations, the introduction of new types can require
   code changes on the RADIUS server which would be unnecessary if basic
   data types had been used instead.  In addition if "ad-hoc" types are



Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                [Page 18]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


   used, attribute-specific parsing is required, which means more
   complex software to develop and maintain.  More complexity can lead
   to more error prone implementations, interoperability problems, and
   even security vulnerabilities.  These issues can increase costs to
   network administrators as well as reducing reliability and
   introducing deployment barriers.


3.2.4.  Complex Data Type Exceptions

   As described in Section 2.1, the introduction of complex data types
   is discouraged where viable alternatives are available.  A potential
   exception is attributes that inherently require code changes on both
   the client and server.  For example, as described in Appendix B,
   complex attributes have been used in situations involving
   authentication and security attributes which need to be dynamically
   computed and verified.  Supporting this functionality requires code
   changes on both the RADIUS client and server, regardless of the
   attribute format.  As a result, in most cases, the use of complex
   attributes to represent these methods is acceptable, and does not
   create additional interoperability or deployment issues.

   Another exception to the recommendation against complex types is for
   types that can be treated as opaque data by the RADIUS server.  For
   example, the EAP-Message attribute, defined in [RFC3579] Section 3.1
   contains a complex data type that is an EAP packet.  Since these
   complex types do not need to be parsed by the RADIUS server, the
   issues arising from server limitations do not arise.  Similarly,
   since attributes of these complex types can be configured on the
   server using a data type of String, dictionary limitations are also
   not encountered.  Appendix A.1 below includes a series of checklists
   that may be used to analyze a design for RECOMMENDED and NOT
   RECOMMENDED behavior in relation to complex types.

   If the RADIUS Server simply passes the contents of an attribute to
   some non-RADIUS portion of the network, then the data is opaque to
   RADIUS, and SHOULD be defined to be of type String.  A concrete way
   of judging this requirement is whether or not the attribute
   definition in the RADIUS document contains delineated fields for sub-
   parts of the data.  If those fields need to be delineated in RADIUS,
   then the data is not opaque to RADIUS, and it SHOULD be separated
   into individual RADIUS attributes.

   An examination of existing RADIUS RFCs discloses a number of complex
   attributes that have already been defined.  Appendix B includes a
   listing of complex attributes used within [RFC2865], [RFC2868],
   [RFC2869], [RFC3162], [RFC4818], and [RFC4675].  The discussion of
   these attributes includes reasons why a complex type is acceptable,



Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                [Page 19]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


   or suggestions for how the attribute could have been defined to
   follow the RADIUS data model.

   In other cases, the data in the complex type are described textually
   in a specification.  This is possible because the data types are not
   sent within the attributes, but are a matter for endpoint
   interpretation.  An implementation can define additional data types,
   and use these data types today by matching them to the attributes
   textual definition.

3.3.  Vendor Space

   The usage model for RADIUS VSAs is described in [RFC2865] Section
   6.2:

      Note that RADIUS defines a mechanism for Vendor-Specific
      extensions (Attribute 26) and the use of that should be encouraged
      instead of allocation of global attribute types, for functions
      specific only to one vendor's implementation of RADIUS, where no
      interoperability is deemed useful.

   Nevertheless, many new attributes have been defined in the vendor
   specific space in situations where interoperability is not only
   useful, but is required.  For example, SDOs outside the IETF (such as
   the IEEE 802 and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)) have
   been assigned Vendor-Ids, enabling them to define their own VSA
   encoding and assign Vendor types within their own space.

   The use of VSAs by SDOs outside the IETF has gained in popularity for
   several reasons:

   Efficiency
      As with SNMP, which defines an "Enterprise" Object Identifier
      (OID) space suitable for use by vendors as well as other SDOs, the
      definition of Vendor-Specific RADIUS attributes has become a
      common occurrence as part of standards activity outside the IETF.
      For reasons of efficiency, it is easiest if the RADIUS attributes
      required to manage a standard are developed within the same SDO
      that develops the standard itself.  As noted in "Transferring MIB
      Work from IETF Bridge MIB WG to IEEE 802.1 WG" [RFC4663], today
      few vendors are willing to simultaneously fund individuals to
      participate within an SDO to complete a standard, as well as to
      participate in the IETF in order to complete the associated RADIUS
      attributes specification.

   Attribute scarcity
      The standard RADIUS attribute space is limited to 255 unique
      attributes.  Of these, only about half remain available for



Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                [Page 20]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


      allocation.  In the vendor space, the number of attributes
      available is a function of the encoding of the attribute (the size
      of the Vendor type field).


3.3.1.  Interoperability Considerations

   Vendors and SDOs are reminded that the standard RADIUS attribute
   space, and the enumerated value space for enumerated attributes, are
   reserved for allocation through work published via the IETF, as noted
   in [RFC3575] Section 2.1.  Some vendors and SDOs have in the past
   assigning vendor-specific meaning to "unused" values from the
   standard space.  This process results in interoperability issues, and
   is counter-productive.  Similarly, the Vendor-Specific enumeration
   practice discussed in [RFC2882] Section 2.2.1 is NOT RECOMMENDED.

   If it is not possible to follow the IETF process, vendors and SDOs
   SHOULD self-allocate an attribute, which MUST be in their own vendor
   space, as discussed in Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3, below.

   The design and specification of VSAs for multi-vendor usage SHOULD be
   undertaken with the same level of care as standard RADIUS attributes.
   Specifically, the provisions of this document that apply to standard
   RADIUS attributes also apply to VSAs for multi-vendor usage.

3.3.2.  Vendor Allocations

   As noted in [RFC3575] Section 2.1, vendors are encouraged to utilize
   VSAs to define functions "specific only to one vendor's
   implementation of RADIUS, where no interoperability is deemed useful.
   For functions specific only to one vendor's implementation of RADIUS,
   the use of that should be encouraged instead of the allocation of
   global attribute types."

   The recommendation for vendors to allocate attributes from a vendor
   space rather than via the IETF process is a recognition that vendors
   desire to assert change control over their own RADIUS specifications.
   This change control can be obtained by requesting a PEN from the
   Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA), for use as a Vendor-Id
   within a Vendor-Specific attribute. The vendor can then allocate
   attributes within the VSA space defined by that Vendor-Id, at their
   sole discretion.  Similarly, the use of data types (complex or
   otherwise) within that VSA space is solely under the discretion of
   the vendor.







Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                [Page 21]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


3.3.3.  SDO Allocations

   Given the expanded utilization of RADIUS, it has become apparent that
   requiring SDOs to accomplish all their RADIUS work within the IETF is
   inherently inefficient and unscalable.  Is is therefore RECOMMENDED
   that SDO RADIUS Attribute specifications allocate attributes from the
   vendor space, rather than requesting an allocation from the RADIUS
   standard attribute space, for attributes matching any of the
   following criteria:

      * attributes relying on data types not defined within RADIUS

      * attributes intended primarily for use within an SDO

      * attributes intended primarily for use within a group of SDOs.

   Any new RADIUS attributes or values intended for interoperable use
   across a broad spectrum of the Internet Community SHOULD follow the
   allocation process defined in [RFC3575].

   The recommendation for SDOs to allocate attributes from a vendor
   space rather than via the IETF process is a recognition that SDOs
   desire to assert change control over their own RADIUS specifications.
   This change control can be obtained by requesting a PEN from the
   Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA), for use as a Vendor-Id
   within a Vendor-Specific attribute. The SDO can then allocate
   attributes within the VSA space defined by that Vendor-Id, at their
   sole discretion.  Similarly, the use of data types (complex or
   otherwise) within that VSA space is solely under the discretion of
   the SDO.

3.4.  Polymorphic Attributes

   A polymorphic attribute is one whose format or meaning is dynamic.
   For example, rather than using a fixed data format, an attribute's
   format might change based on the contents of another attribute.  Or,
   the meaning of an attribute may depend on earlier packets in a
   sequence.

   RADIUS server dictionary entries are typically static, enabling the
   user to enter the contents of an attribute without support for
   changing the format based on dynamic conditions.  However, this
   limitation on static types does not prevent implementations from
   implementing policies that return different attributes based on the
   contents of received attributes; this is a common feature of existing
   RADIUS implementations.

   In general, polymorphism is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Polymorphism rarely



Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                [Page 22]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


   enables capabilities that would not be available through use of
   multiple attributes.  Polymorphism requires code changes in the
   RADIUS server in situations where attributes with fixed formats would
   not require such changes.  Thus, polymorphism increases complexity
   while decreasing generality, without delivering any corresponding
   benefits.

   Note that changing an attribute's format dynamically is not the same
   thing as using a fixed format and computing the attribute itself
   dynamically.  RADIUS authentication attributes such as User-Password,
   EAP-Message, etc. while being computed dynamically, use a fixed
   format.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no action items for IANA.  However, it does provide
   guidelines for Expert Reviewers appointed as described in [RFC3575].

5.  Security Considerations

   This specification provides guidelines for the design of RADIUS
   attributes used in authentication, authorization and accounting.
   Threats and security issues for this application are described in
   [RFC3579] and [RFC3580]; security issues encountered in roaming are
   described in [RFC2607].

   Obfuscation of RADIUS attributes on a per-attribute basis is
   necessary in some cases.  The current standard mechanism for this is
   described in [RFC2865] Section 5.2 (for obscuring User-Password
   values) and is based on the MD5 algorithm specified in [RFC1321].
   The MD5 and SHA-1 algorithms have recently become a focus of scrutiny
   and concern in security circles, and as a result, the use of these
   algorithms in new attributes is NOT RECOMMENDED.  In addition,
   previous documents referred to this method as generating "encrypted"
   data.  This terminology is no longer accepted within the
   cryptographic community.

   Where new RADIUS attributes use cryptographic algorithms, algorithm
   negotiation SHOULD be supported.  Specification of a mandatory-to-
   implement algorithm is REQUIRED, and it is RECOMMENDED that the
   mandatory-to-implement algorithm be certifiable under FIPS 140
   [FIPS].

   Where new RADIUS attributes encapsulate complex data types, or
   transport opaque data, the security considerations discussed in
   Section 5.1 SHOULD be addressed.

   Message authentication in RADIUS is provided largely via the Message-



Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                [Page 23]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


   Authenticator attribute.  See [RFC3579] Section 3.2, and also
   [RFC5080] 2.2.2, which says that client implementations SHOULD
   include a Message-Authenticator attribute in every Access-Request.

   In general, the security of the RADIUS protocol is poor.  Robust
   deployments SHOULD support a secure communications protocol such as
   IPSec.  See [RFC3579] Section 4, and [RFC3580] Section 5 for a more
   in-depth explanation of these issues.

   Implementations not following the suggestions outlined in this
   document may be subject to a problems such as ambiguous protocol
   decoding, packet loss leading to loss of billing information, and
   denial of service attacks.

5.1.  New Data Types and Complex Attributes

   The introduction of complex data types brings the potential for the
   introduction of new security vulnerabilities.  Experience shows that
   the common data types have few security vulnerabilities, or else that
   all known issues have been found and fixed.  New data types require
   new code, which may introduce new bugs, and therefore new attack
   vectors.

   Some systems permit complex attributes to be defined via a method
   that is more capable than traditional RADIUS dictionaries.  These
   systems can reduce the security threat of new types significantly,
   but they do not remove it entirely.

   RADIUS servers are highly valued targets, as they control network
   access and interact with databases that store usernames and
   passwords.  An extreme outcome of a vulnerability due to a new,
   complex type would be that an attacker is capable of taking complete
   control over the RADIUS server.

   The use of attributes representing opaque data does not reduce this
   threat.  The threat merely moves from the RADIUS server to the system
   that consumes that opaque data.  The threat is particularly severe
   when the opaque data originates from the user, and is not validated
   by the NAS.  In those cases, the RADIUS server is potentially exposed
   to attack by malware residing on an unauthenticated host.

   Any system consuming opaque data that originates from a RADIUS system
   SHOULD be properly isolated from that RADIUS system, and SHOULD run
   with minimal privileges.  Any potential vulnerabilities in the non-
   RADIUS system will then have minimal impact on the security of the
   system as a whole.

Appendix A - Design Guidelines

   The following text provides guidelines for the design of attributes
   used by the RADIUS protocol.  Specifications that follow these
   guidelines are expected to achieve maximum interoperability with
   minimal changes to existing systems.

A.1. Types matching the RADIUS data model

A.1.1. Transport of basic data types

   Does the data fit within the basic data types described in Section
   2.1?  If so, it SHOULD be encapsulated in a [RFC2865] format RADIUS
   attribute, or in a [RFC2865] format RADIUS VSA that uses one of the
   existing RADIUS data types.

A.1.2. Transport of Authentication and Security Data

   Does the data provide authentication and/or security capabilities for
   the RADIUS protocol, as outlined below?  If so, use of a complex data
   type is acceptable, under the following circumstances:

      * Complex data types that carry authentication methods which
        RADIUS servers are expected to parse and verify as part of
        an authentication process.

      * Complex data types that carry security information intended
        to increase the security of the RADIUS protocol itself.

   Any data type carrying authentication and/or security data that is
   not meant to be parsed by a RADIUS server is an "opaque data type",
   as defined below.

A.1.3. Opaque data types

   Does the attribute encapsulate an existing data structure defined
   outside of the RADIUS specifications?  Can the attribute be treated
   as opaque data by RADIUS servers (including proxies?)  If both
   questions can be answered affirmatively, a complex structure MAY be
   used in a RADIUS specification.

   The specification of the attribute SHOULD define the encapsulating
   attribute to be of type String.  The specification SHOULD refer to an
   external document defining the structure.  The specification SHOULD
   NOT define or describe the structure, for reasons discussed above in
   Section 3.2.3.

A.1.4. Pre-existing data types



Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                [Page 28]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


   There is a trade-off in design between re-using existing formats for
   historical compatibility, or choosing new formats for a "better"
   design.  This trade-off does not always require the "better" design
   to be used.  As a result, pre-existing complex data types described
   in Appendix B MAY be used.

A.2. Improper Data Types

   This section suggests alternatives to data types which do not fall
   within the "basic data type" definition.  Section A.2.1 describes
   simple data types which should be replaced by basic data types.
   Section A.2.2 descibes more complex data types which should be
   replaced by multiple attributes using the basic data types.

A.2.1. Simple Data Types

   Does the attribute use any of the following data types?  If so, the
   data type SHOULD be replaced with the suggested alternatives, or it
   SHOULD NOT be used at all.

      * Signed integers of any size.
        SHOULD NOT be used.  SHOULD be replaced with one or more
        unsigned integer attributes.  The definition of the attribute
        can contain information that would otherwise go into the sign
        value of the integer.

      * 8 bit unsigned integers.
        SHOULD be replaced with 32-bit unsigned integer.  There is
        insufficient justification to save three bytes.

      * 16 bit unsigned integers.
        SHOULD be replaced with 32-bit unsigned integer.  There is
        insufficient justification to save two bytes.

      * Unsigned integers of size other than 32 bits.
        SHOULD be replaced by an unsigned integer of 32 bits.
        There is insufficient justification to define a new size of
        integer.

      * Integers of any size in non-network byte order
        SHOULD be replaced by unsigned integer of 32 bits in network
        There is no reason to transport integers in any format other
        than network byte order.

      * Multi-field text strings.
        Each field SHOULD be encapsulated in a separate attribute.

      * Polymorphic attributes.



Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                [Page 29]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


        Multiple attributes, each with a static data type SHOULD be
        defined instead.

      * Nested AVPs.
        Attributes should be defined in a flat typespace.

A.2.2. More Complex Data Types

   Does the attribute:

   * define a complex data type not described in Appendix B,

   * that a RADIUS server and/or client is expected to parse,
     validate, or create the contents of via a dynamic computation?
     i.e. A type that cannot be treated as opaque data (Section A.1.3)

   * involve functionality that could be implemented without code
     changes on both the client and server?  (i.e. a type that doesn't
     require dynamic computation and verification, such as those
     performed for authentication or security attributes)

   If so, this data type SHOULD be replaced with simpler types, as
   discussed above in Appendix A.2.1.  See also Section 2.1 for a
   discussion of why complex types are problematic.

A.3. Vendor-Specific formats

   Does the specification contain Vendor-Specific attributes that match
   any of the following criteria?  If so, the VSA encoding should be
   replaced with the [RFC2865] Section 5.26 encoding, or should not be
   used at all.

      * Vendor types of more than 8 bits.
        SHOULD NOT be used.  Vendor types of 8 bits SHOULD be used
        instead.

      * Vendor lengths of less than 8 bits.  (i.e., zero bits)
        SHOULD NOT be used.  Vendor lengths of 8 bits SHOULD be used
        instead.

      * Vendor lengths of more than 8 bits.
        SHOULD NOT be used.  Vendor lengths of 8 bits SHOULD be used
        instead.

      * Vendor-Specific contents that are not in Type-Length-Value
        format.
        SHOULD NOT be used.  Vendor-Specific attributes SHOULD be in
        Type-Length-Value format.



Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                [Page 30]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


   In general, Vendor-Specific attributes SHOULD follow the [RFC2865]
   Section 5.26 suggested encoding.  Vendor extensions to non-standard
   encodings are NOT RECOMMENDED as they can negatively affect
   interoperability.

A.4. Changes to the RADIUS Operational Model

   Does the specification change the RADIUS operation model, as outlined
   in the list below?  If so, then another method of achieving the
   design objectives SHOULD be used.  Potential problem areas include:

      * Defining new commands in RADIUS using attributes.
        The addition of new commands to RADIUS MUST be handled via
        allocation of a new Code, and not by the use of an attribute.
        This restriction includes new commands created by overloading
        the Service-Type attribute to define new values that modify
        the functionality of Access-Request packets.

      * Using RADIUS as a transport protocol for data unrelated to
        authentication, authorization, or accounting.  Using RADIUS to
        transport authentication methods such as EAP is explicitly
        permitted, even if those methods require the transport of
        relatively large amounts of data.  Transport of opaque data
        relating to AAA is also permitted, as discussed above in
        Section 3.2.3. However, if the specification does not relate
        to AAA, then RADIUS SHOULD NOT be used.

      * Assuming support for packet lengths greater than 4096 octets.
        Attribute designers cannot assume that RADIUS implementations
        can successfully handle packets larger than 4096 octets.
        If a specification could lead to a RADIUS packet larger than
        4096 octets, then the alternatives described in Section 3.3
        SHOULD be considered.

      * Stateless operation.  The RADIUS protocol is stateless, and
        documents which require stateful protocol behavior without the
        use of the State Attribute need to be redesigned.

      * Provisioning of service in an Access-Reject.
        Such provisioning is not permitted, and MUST NOT be used.  If
        limited access needs to be provided, then an Access-Accept with
        appropriate authorizations can be used instead.

      * Provisioning of service in a Disconnect-Request.
        Such provisioning is not permitted, and MUST NOT be used.
        If limited access needs to be provided, then a CoA-Request
        with appropriate authorizations can be used instead.




Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                [Page 31]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


      * Lack of user authentication or authorization restrictions.
        In an authorization check, where there is no demonstration of a
        live user, confidential data cannot be returned.  Where there
        is a link to a previous user authentication, the State attribute
        SHOULD be present.

      * Lack of per-packet integrity and authentication.
        It is expected that documents will support per-packet
        integrity and authentication.

      * Modification of RADIUS packet sequences.
        In RADIUS, each request is encapsulated in its own packet, and
        elicits a single response that is sent to the requester.  Since
        changes to this paradigm are likely to require major
        modifications to RADIUS client and server implementations, they
        SHOULD be avoided if possible.
      For further details, see Section 3.1.

A.5. Allocation of attributes

   Does the attribute have a limited scope of applicability, as outlined
   below?  If so, then the attributes SHOULD be allocated from the
   vendor space, rather than requesting allocation from the standard
   space.

      * attributes intended for a vendor to support their own systems,
      and not suitable for general usage

      * attributes relying on data types not defined within RADIUS

      * attributes intended primarily for use within an SDO

      * attributes intended primarily for use within a group of SDOs.

   Note that the points listed above do not relax the recommendations
   discussed in this document.  Instead, they recognize that the RADIUS
   data model has limitations.  In certain situations where
   interoperability can be strongly constrained by the SDO or vendor, an
   expanded data model MAY be used.  It is RECOMMENDED, however, that
   the RADIUS data model be used, even when it is marginally less
   efficient than alternatives.

   When attributes are used primarily within a group of SDOs, and are
   not applicable to the wider Internet community, we expect that one
   SDO will be responsible for allocation from their own private space.

Appendix B - Complex Attributes

   This section summarizes RADIUS attributes with complex data types
   that are defined in existing RFCs.

   This appendix is published for informational purposes only, and
   reflects the usage of attributes with complex data types at the time
   of the publication of this document.

B.1. CHAP-Password

   [RFC2865] Section 5.3 defines the CHAP-Password Attribute which is
   sent from the RADIUS client to the RADIUS server in an Access-
   Request.  The data type of the CHAP Identifier is not given, only the
   one octet length:

    0                   1                   2
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
   |     Type      |    Length     |  CHAP Ident   |  String ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

   Since this is an authentication attribute, code changes are required
   on the RADIUS client and server to support it, regardless of the
   attribute format.  Therefore, this complex data type is acceptable in
   this situation.

B.2. CHAP-Challenge

   [RFC2865] Section 5.40 defines the CHAP-Challenge Attribute which is
   sent from the RADIUS client to the RADIUS server in an Access-
   Request.  While the data type of the CHAP Identifier is given, the
   text also says:

      If the CHAP challenge value is 16 octets long it MAY be placed in
      the Request Authenticator field instead of using this attribute.

   Defining attributes to contain values taken from the RADIUS packet
   header is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Attributes should have values that are
   packed into a RADIUS AVP.

B.3. Tunnel-Password

   [RFC2868] Section 3.5 defines the Tunnel-Password Attribute, which is
   sent from the RADIUS server to the client in an Access-Accept.  This
   attribute includes Tag and Salt fields, as well as a string field
   which consists of three logical sub-fields: the Data-Length (one
   octet) and Password sub-fields (both of which are required), and the



Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                [Page 33]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


   optional Padding sub-field.  The attribute appears as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     Type      |    Length     |     Tag       |   Salt
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      Salt (cont)  |   String ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Since this is a security attribute, code changes are required on the
   RADIUS client and server to support it, regardless of the attribute
   format.  However, while use of a complex data type is acceptable in
   this situation, the design of the Tunnel-Password attribute is
   problematic from a security perspective, since it uses MD5 as a
   cipher, and provides a password to a NAS, potentially without proper
   authorization.

B.4. ARAP-Password

   [RFC2869] Section 5.4 defines the ARAP-Password attribute, which is
   sent from the RADIUS client to the server in an Access-Request.  It
   contains four 4 octet values, instead of having a single Value field:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     Type      |    Length     |             Value1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                   |             Value2
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                   |             Value3
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                   |             Value4
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                   |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   As with the CHAP-Password attribute, this is an authentication
   attribute which would have required code changes on the RADIUS client
   and server regardless of format.

B.5. ARAP-Features

   [RFC2869] Section 5.5 defines the ARAP-Features Attribute, which is
   sent from the RADIUS server to the client in an Access-Accept or
   Access-Challenge.  It contains a compound string of two single octet
   values, plus three 4-octet values, which the RADIUS client

   encapsulates in a feature flags packet in the ARAP protocol:

   0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     Type      |    Length     |     Value1    |    Value2     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                           Value3                              |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                           Value4                              |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                           Value5                              |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Unlike the previous attributes, this attribute contains no encrypted
   component, nor is it directly involved in authentication.  The
   individual sub-fields therefore could have been encapsulated in
   separate attributes.

   While the contents of this attribute is intended to be placed in an
   ARAP packet, the fields need to be set by the RADIUS server.  Using
   standard RADIUS data types would have simplified RADIUS server
   implementations, and subsequent management.  The current form of the
   attribute requires either the RADIUS server implementation, or the
   RADIUS server administrator, to understand the internals of the ARAP
   protocol.

B.6. Connect-Info

   [RFC2869] Section 5.11 defines the Connect-Info attribute, which is
   used to indicate the nature of the connection.

    0                   1                   2
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     Type      |    Length     |     Text...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Even though the type is Text, the rest of the description indicates
   that it is a complex attribute:

      The Text field consists of UTF-8 encoded 10646 _8_ characters.
      The connection speed SHOULD be included at the beginning of the
      first Connect-Info attribute in the packet.  If the transmit and
      receive connection speeds differ, they may both be included in the
      first attribute with the transmit speed first (the speed the NAS
      modem transmits at), a slash (/), the receive speed, then
      optionally other information.

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


      For example, "28800 V42BIS/LAPM" or "52000/31200 V90"

      More than one Connect-Info attribute may be present in an
      Accounting-Request packet to accommodate expected efforts by ITU
      to have modems report more connection information in a standard
      format that might exceed 252 octets.

   This attribute contains no encrypted component, and is it not
   directly involved in authentication.  The individual sub-fields could
   therefore have been encapsulated in separate attributes.

   However, since the definition refers to potential standardization
   activity within ITU, the Connect-Info attribute can also be thought
   of as opaque data whose definition is provided elsewhere.  The
   Connect-Info attribute could therefore qualify for an exception as
   described in Section 3.2.3.

B.7. Framed-IPv6-Prefix

   [RFC3162] Section 2.3 defines the Framed-IPv6-Prefix Attribute and
   [RFC4818] Section 3 reuses this format for the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix
   Attribute; these attributes are sent from the RADIUS server to the
   client in an Access-Accept.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     Type      |    Length     |  Reserved     | Prefix-Length |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                Prefix
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                Prefix
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                Prefix
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                Prefix                             |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The sub-fields encoded in these attributes are strongly related, and
   there was no previous definition of this data structure that could be
   referenced.  Support for this attribute requires code changes on both
   the client and server, due to a new data type being defined.  In this
   case it appears to be acceptable to encode them in one attribute.

B.8. Egress-VLANID

   [RFC4675] Section 2.1 defines the Egress-VLANID Attribute which can
   be sent by a RADIUS client or server.



Weber, et al.             Best Current Practice                [Page 36]

INTERNET-DRAFT          RADIUS Design Guidelines         8 November 2010


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |    Length     |            Value
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
              Value (cont)            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   While it appears superficially to be of type Integer, the Value field
   is actually a packed structure, as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Tag Indic.   |        Pad            |       VLANID          |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The length of the VLANID field is defined by the [IEEE-802.1Q]
   specification.  The Tag indicator field is either 0x31 or 0x32, for
   compatibility with the Egress-VLAN-Name, as discussed below.  The
   complex structure of Egress-VLANID overlaps with that of the base
   Integer data type, meaning that no code changes are required for a
   RADIUS server to support this attribute.  Code changes are required
   on the NAS, if only to implement the VLAN ID enforcement.

   Given the IEEE VLAN requirements and the limited data model of
   RADIUS, the chosen method is likely the best of the possible
   alternatives.

B.9. Egress-VLAN-Name

   [RFC4675] Section 2.3 defines the Egress-VLAN-Name Attribute which
   can be sent by a RADIUS client or server.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |    Length     |   Tag Indic.  |   String...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Tag Indicator is either the character '1' or '2', which in ASCII
   map to the identical values for Tag Indicator in Egress-VLANID,
   above.  The complex structure of this attribute is acceptable for
   reasons identical to those given for Egress-VLANID.

B.10. Digest-*

   [RFC5090] attempts to standardize the functionality provided by an

   expired internet-draft [AAA-SIP] which improperly used two attributes
   from the standard space without being assigned them by IANA.  This
   self-allocation is forbidden, as described above in Section 2.  In
   addition, the draft uses nested attributes, which are discouraged in
   Section 2.1.  The updated document uses basic data types, and
   allocates nearly 20 attributes in the process.

   However, the draft has seen wide-spread implementation, where
   [RFC5090] has not.  One explanation may be that implementors
   disagreed with the trade-offs made in the updated specification.  It
   may have been better to simply document the existing format, and
   request IANA allocation of two attributes.  The resulting design
   would have used nested attributes, but may have gained more wide-
   spread implementation.

   AAA server.  The attributes cover the assignment or reporting of the
   following; a specific host IPv6 address; a recursive DNS IPv6 server
   address; a specific IPv6 route announced to a host; a named IPv6
   delegated prefix pool to be used for assignments to an accessing
   host.

Internet-Draft             RADIUS IPv6 Access                  July 2010


1.  Introduction

   In IPv6 deployments DHCPv6 and/or ICMPv6 Router Advertisements can be
   used to convey configuration information by a NAS towards accessing
   hosts.  Such information typically needs to be provisioned on the NAS
   and may be done so on a per host or user basis using the AAA process.
   This document specifies IPv6 RADIUS attributes used to support
   configuration information allowed for by DHCPv6 and/or ICMPv6, which
   complement the existing set defined in [RFC3162] and [RFC4818].
   Specifically, attributes supporting the following information in
   Radius are covered by this draft:

   o  The assignment or reporting of specific IPv6 addresses assigned to
      hosts (where host address assignmenet takes place via DHCPv6)

   o  The passing by the NAS of IPv6 recursive DNS server addresses to a
      host (where the NAS and accessing host use DHCPv6 or [RFC5006])

   o  The passing of IPv6 Route information by the NAS intended to be
      advertised to the host (where the NAS and accessing host use
      [RFC4191] or equivalent mechanisms).

   o  The assignment of a named prefix pool intended for Prefix
      Delegation to a host (where the NAS and accessing host use
      [RFC3633]).


2.  Deployment Scenarios

   A common broadband network scenario is illustrated in Figure 1.  It
   is composed of a IP Routing Residential Gateway (RG) or host, a Layer
   2 Access-Node (e.g. a DSLAM), one or more IP Network Access Servers
   (NASes), and an AAA server.  The RG or host are expected to be multi
   homed at Layer 2 to both NASes.  Layer 2 Connectivity between the
   host and NAS can be either via PPPoE or IP over Ethernet, and
   established dynamically.

                              Figure 1

   In the illustrated deployment scenario the NASes are assumed to embed
   a DHCPv6 server function that allows them to locally handle any
   DHCPv6 requests issued by RGs/hosts.  This scenario is particularly
   useful in illustrating the possible interaction between RADIUS and
   DHCPv6, however the options defined in this document are not
   restricted to be used only in the presence of such embedded
   functionality.

   The NAS interfaces to the AAA server by means of the RADIUS protocol.
   The AAA server is expected to authenticate each accessing RG/host and
   to return to the NAS per host authorization and network configuration
   information that can comprise of: One or more IP addresses Recursive
   DNS servers intended to be announced to the host; specific IP routes
   to be announced to the host by a NAS; an explicit 128 bit IPv6
   address that is to be statefuly assigned to a given RG/host.  The NAS
   can also report some of this information back to the AAA server in
   accounting messages.

   The known methods by which the NAS can communicate the above
   information to RG/hosts are explained in each of the following sub-
   sections.

2.1.  IPv6 Address Assignment

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] provides a mechanism to assign one or more or non-
   temporary IPv6 addresses to nodes complementing the ICMPv6 stateless
   (SLAAC) method [RFC4862].  Simplistically, using SLAAC the NAS
   announces to a host a /64 IPv6 prefix from which the host construct
   its full 128 bit IPv6 address by appending an 64-bit interface-
   identifier.  By providing one or more hosts with only a /64 prefix,
   network operators are have to rely on extra processes or procedures



Lourdelet, et al.        Expires January 7, 2011                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft             RADIUS IPv6 Access                  July 2010


   to determine the exact IPv6 address that is being used by a host.
   Such procedures typically involve processing of two existing
   [RFC3162] attributes.  In contrast to SLAAC, DHCPv6 allows for an
   operator to uniquely assign a non-temporary address to a give host.
   This document specifies a single RADIUS attribute intended to be used
   for the assignment or accounting of a full 128-bit IPv6 addresses to
   a host (typically via DHCPv6), without overloading or modifying the
   implementations associated to the existing attributes.

2.2.  Recursive DNS Servers

   DHCPv6 provides an option for recursive DNS servers to hosts, as does
   ICMPv6 with Router Advertisements supporting the experimental
   [RFC5006] option.  Existing IETF Radius attributes convey DNS as 32-
   bit IPv4 addresses and cannot support a 128-bit IPv6 address.  This
   document specifies the RADIUS attribute to convey a list of IPv6 DNS
   Recursive name server addresses, from an AAA server, which can that
   can be conveyed by a NAS to a host.

2.3.  IPv6 Route Information

   In scenarios where Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
   [RFC4862] is used for address assignment, an ICMPv6 Router
   Advertisement is multicast by the NAS with one or more Prefix
   Information Options with the autonomous-bit set to true.  In such
   cases, the Prefix Information Option, is a /64 prefix to which a host
   appends its locally-generated Interface Id to create a unique 128-bit
   IPv6 address.  [RFC3162] currently defines a Radius Framed-IPv6-
   Prefix attribute that can be used by a NAS to advertise such on-link
   prefixes in Router Advertisement messages.  An IPv6 Route Information
   option, defined in [RFC4191] is almost the inverse.  It is intended
   to be used to inform a host connected to the NAS that a specific
   route is reachable via the NAS.  This is particularly desirable in
   cases where the RG or host are multi-homed to different NASes as
   shown in Figure 1.

   This document specifies the RADIUS attribute that allows the AAA
   system to provision the announcement by the NAS of a specific Route
   Information Option to an accessing host.  The NAS may advertise this
   route using the method defined in [RFC4191] or using other equivalent
   methods.

2.4.  Delegated IPv6 Prefix Pool

   The use of DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation [RFC3633] involves a delegating
   router selecting a prefix and delegating it on a temporary basis to a
   requesting router.  The delegating router may implement a number of
   strategies as to how it chooses what prefix is to be delegated to a

Internet-Draft             RADIUS IPv6 Access                  July 2010


   requesting router, one of them being the use of a local named prefix
   pool.  The Delegated IPv6 Prefix Pool attribute is intended to allow
   the AAA system to convey the selected prefix pool name to a NAS
   hosting a DHCPv6-PD server and acting as a delegating router.  While
   similar in principle, this attribute is not to be confused with the
   [RFC3162]Framed-IPv6-Pool attribute, which is intended for selecting
   an address from a pool for assignment to a user interface nor with
   [RFC4818] that conveys a specific prefix.


3.  Attributes

   The fields shown in the diagrams below are transmitted from left to
   right.

3.1.  Framed-IPv6-Address

   This Attribute indicates an IPv6 Address that is assigned to the NAS-
   facing interface of the RG/host.  It MAY be used in Access-Accept
   packets, and MAY appear multiple times.  It MAY be used in an Access-
   Request packet as a hint by the NAS to the server that it would
   prefer these IPv6 address(es), but the server is not required to
   honor the hint.  Since it is assumed that the NAS will add a route
   corresponding to the address, it is not necessary for the server to
   also send a host Framed-IPv6-Route attribute for the same address.

   This Attribute can be used by a DHCPv6 process on the NAS to assign a
   unique IPv6 address to the RG/host, or it can be used for
   a-posteriori validation or announcement of an auto configured address
   to the AAA server.

   A summary of the Framed-IPv6-Address Attribute format is shown below.

3.2.  DNS-Server-IPv6-Address

   The DNS-Server-IPv6-Address Attribute contains the IPv6 address of a
   recursive DNS server.  This attribute MAY be included multiple times
   in Access-Accept packets, when the intention is for a NAS to announce
   more than one recursive DNS address to an RG/host.

   The content of this attribute can be inserted in a Router
   Advertisement as specified in [RFC5006] or mapped to the matching
   DHCPv6 option.

   Type

      TBA4 for Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool

   Length

      Length in bytes.  At least 4.

   String

      The string field contains the name of an assigned IPv6 prefix pool
      configured on the NAS.  The field is not NULL (hex 00) terminated.

3.5.  Table of attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

3.6.  RFC3162 Attribute coexistance

   Syntactically, the Framed-IPv6-Address and the [RFC3162] Framed-IPv6-
   Prefix attributes are identical.  In terms of their applied
   semantics, however the former represents a full 128-bit IPv6 address
   while the latter a /64 prefix intended to be applied with SLAAC on a
   NAS access interface.  These attributes are envisaged to co-exist in
   Radius messages and given existing NAS applications for the Framed-
   IPv6-Prefix it is recommended that each attribute be used for its
   intended purposes.  A functional substitution of one attribute for
   the other may however be an optional configuration feature of a
   Radius client and server.


4.  Diameter Considerations

   Given that the Attributes defined in this document are allocated from
   the standard RADIUS type space (see Section 6), no special handling
   is required by Diameter entities.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the use of RADIUS for the purposes of
   authentication, authorization and accounting in IPv6-enabled
   networks.  In such networks, the RADIUS protocol may run either over
   IPv4 or over IPv6.  Known security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS
   protocol apply to the attributes defined in this document.  Since
   IPSEC is natively defined for IPv6, it is expected that running
   RADIUS implementations supporting IPv6 may want to run over IPSEC.
   Where RADIUS is run over IPSEC and where certificates are used for
   authentication, it may be desirable to avoid management of RADIUS
   shared secrets, so as to leverage the improved scalability of public
   key infrastructure.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the assignment of three new RADIUS Attribute
   Types in the "Radius Types" registry (currently located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types for the following
   attributes:

   o  Framed-IPv6-Address

   o  DNS-Server-IPv6-Address

   o  Route-IPv6-Information

   o  Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool

   IANA should allocate these numbers from the standard RADIUS
   Attributes space using the "IETF Review" policy [RFC5226].

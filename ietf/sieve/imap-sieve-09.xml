          <t>
            Sieve defines an email filtering language that can, in
            principle, plug into any point in the processing of an email
            message.  As defined in the base specification, it plugs into
            mail delivery.  This document defines how Sieve can plug into
            points in the IMAP protocol where messages are created or changed,
            adding the option of user-defined or installation-defined
            filtering (or, with Sieve extensions, features such as notifications).
            Because this requires future Sieve extensions to specify their
            interactions with this one,
            this document updates the base Sieve specification, RFC 5228.

            <t>
              Some applications have a need to apply Sieve filters <xref target="RFC5228"/>
              in contexts other than initial mail delivery.  This
              is especially true in diverse service environments, such as
              when the client is sporadically connected, is connected through
              a high-latency or high-cost channel, or is on a limited-function
              device.  For such clients, it may be very important, for higher
              performance and reliability, to take advantage of server capabilities,
              including those provided by Sieve filtering (and Sieve extensions,
              such as Notify <xref target="RFC5435"/>).
            </t>
            <t>
              This specification defines extensions to IMAP <xref target="RFC3501"/>
              to support the invocation of Sieve scripts at times when the
              IMAP server creates new messages or modifies existing ones.
              It also defines how Sieve scripts will process these invocations.
              Support for IMAP events in Sieve also requires support for the following:
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>
                  IMAP Metadata <xref target="RFC5464"/>,
                  because Metadata is used to associate scripts with IMAP mailboxes.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Sieve Environment <xref target="RFC5183"/>,
                  because it defines an important way for Sieve scripts to test
              the conditions under which they have been invoked.
            </t>
            <t>
                  Sieve IMAP4Flags <xref target="RFC5232"/>,
                  because it provides important functionality in handling IMAP events
                  related to flag changes.
                </t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t>
              Because this requires future Sieve extensions to specify their
              interactions with this one (see <xref target="action-future"/>),
              this document updates the base Sieve specification, RFC 5228.

          <section anchor="differences" title="Differences Between IMAP Events and Mail Delivery">
            <t>
              Invoking Sieve scripts in a context other than initial mail delivery
              introduces new situations, which changes the applicability of Sieve
              features and creates implementation challenges and user interface issues.
              This section discusses some of those differences, challenges, and issues.
            </t>
            <t>
              At times other than message delivery, delivery "envelope" information might
              not be available.  With messages added through IMAP APPEND, there might be no
              way to even guess who the intended recipient is, and no concept of who "sent"
              the message.  Sieve actions that relate to contacting the sender, for example,
              will not be applicable.
            </t>
            <t>
              Because IMAP events will often be triggered by user actions, and because
              user interfaces allow bulk actions that differ from individual message arrival,
              it now becomes possible for a single user action, such as drag-and-drop, to
              initiate Sieve script processing on a large number of messages at once.
              Implementations will have to deal with such situations as a "COPY" action
              or flag changes on dozens, or even thousands of messages.
            </t>
            <t>
              Other issues might surface as this extension is deployed and experience with
              it develops.

        <section anchor="imapspec" title='The IMAP Events in Sieve Extension'>
          <section anchor="capability" title='The "imapsieve" Capability Strings'>
            <t>
              An IMAP server advertises support for IMAP events in Sieve
              through the "imapsieve" capability.
              A server that advertises "imapsieve" is claiming to be in
              compliance with this specification in all aspects.
              The syntax of the "imapsieve" capability string is defined as follows:
              <list style="hanging" hangIndent="8">
                <t hangText="capability /=">"IMAPSIEVE=" sieveurl-server
                  <vspace/>
                  ; &lt;sieveurl-server&gt; is defined in RFC 5804, Section 3
                </t>
              </list>
              Only one "imapsieve" capability string, specifying one sieveurl-server,
              is allowed to be present.
              The sieveurl-server identifies the ManageSieve server that clients need to
              contact for managing Sieve scripts associated with this IMAP server.
            </t>
            <t>
              The corresponding Sieve implementation uses the Sieve capability
              string "imapsieve", and Sieve scripts that depend
              upon the IMAP events MUST include that string in their "required"
              lists.
            </t>
            <t>
              Implementations that support IMAP events in Sieve MUST also support
              IMAP Metadata <xref target="RFC5464"/>
              and Sieve Environment <xref target="RFC5183"/>,
              because Metadata is used to associate scripts with IMAP
              mailboxes and
              Environment defines an important way for Sieve scripts to test
              the conditions under which they have been invoked.
              Notwithstanding the support requirement,
              scripts that directly use Environment MUST also include
              its capability string in their "required" lists.
            </t>
          </section>

          <section anchor="oldfunc" title='Existing IMAP Functions Affected by IMAP events in Sieve'>
            <t>
              The subsections below describe in detail the IMAP commands and
              situations on which IMAP events in Sieve have an effect.
              Not all Sieve actions make sense in the case of messages
              affected by IMAP commands.
              See <xref target="sieveactions"/> for details.
            </t>
            <t>
              It's important to note that since the base Sieve specification (see <xref target="RFC5228"/>)
              and its extensions define functions for scripts that are invoked during
              initial mail delivery, those function definitions are necessarily tailored to
              and limited by that context.  This document extends those function definitions
              for use during IMAP events.  By nature of that, Sieve functions, in this
              extended context, may behave somewhat differently, though their extended
              behaviour will still be consistent with the functions' goals.
            </t>
            <t>
              If more than one message is affected at the same time,
              each message triggers the execution of a Sieve script separately.
              The scripts MAY be run in parallel.
            </t>

            <section anchor="imapappend" title='The IMAP APPEND Command'>
              <t>
                A message may be added to a mailbox through the IMAP APPEND
                command.  In a server that advertises "imapsieve", new messages
                added in this way MUST trigger the execution of a Sieve script,
                subject to the settings defined through Metadata
                (see <xref target="metadata-def"/>).
              </t>
              <t>
                If the IMAP server also supports the IMAP MultiAppend extension
                <xref target="RFC3502"/>, the APPEND command can create more
                than one message at a time.
                In that case, each message creation is considered a separate
                event, and any applicable Sieve script is called once for each
                message.
              </t>
            </section>

            <section anchor="imapcopy" title='The IMAP COPY Command'>
              <t>
                One or more messages may be added to a mailbox through the IMAP COPY
                command.  In a server that advertises "imapsieve", new messages
                added in this way MUST trigger the execution of a Sieve script,
                subject to the settings defined through Metadata.
              </t>
            </section>

            <section anchor="imapflags" title='Changes to IMAP Message Flags'>
              <t>
                One or more existing messages can have their flags changed
                in a number of ways, including:
                <list style="symbols">
                  <t>The FETCH command (may cause the \Seen flag to be set).</t>
                  <t>The STORE command (may cause the \Answered, \Deleted,
                    \Draft, \Flagged, and \Seen flags to be set or reset,
                    and may cause keywords to be set or reset).</t>
                  <t>The invocation of a Sieve script on an existing message,
                  where the script uses one of the actions defined in
                  the IMAP4Flags extension <xref target="RFC5232"/>
                  to change the flags.
                  </t>
                </list>
                In a server that advertises "imapsieve", messages whose flags
                are changed in any way (except as explained in the next sentence)
                MUST trigger the execution of a Sieve script,
                subject to the settings defined through Metadata.
                The exception is that in order to avoid script loops,
                flag changes that are made as a result of a script that was
                itself invoked because of flag changes SHOULD NOT result in
                a further invocation of the script.
                In any case, implementations MUST take steps to avoid such loops.
              </t>
              <t>
                For flag-change events, the Sieve script will see the message flags
                as they are AFTER the changes.
              </t>
            </section>

            <section anchor="deleted-flag" title="When Script Actions Set the &#x5C;Deleted Flag">
              <t>
                There are times when the actions "fileinto" (see <xref target="action-fileinto"/>),
                "redirect" (see <xref target="action-redirect"/>),
                and "discard" (see <xref target="action-discard"/>)
                will set the \Deleted flag on the message.
                In those cases, the following apply:
              </t>
              <t>
                When the \Deleted flag is set by the script, a flag-change
                Sieve script is not invoked.
              </t>
              <t>
                The implementation MAY then expunge the original message
                (WITHOUT expunging other messages in the mailbox).
                Alternatively, it might have expunges batched or done by a user.
                (It might be helpful to allow the user to make this choice through a preference.)
              </t>
              <t>
                If the server does the expunge, the effect is as though a client had
                flagged the message and done a UID EXPUNGE
                (see <xref target="RFC4315"/>) on the affected message(s) only.
                Handling it this way
                allows clients to handle messages consistently, and avoids hidden
                changes that might invalidate their message caches.

          <section anchor="newfunc" title='New Functions Defined by IMAP events in Sieve'>
            <section anchor="metadata-def" title='Interaction with Metadata'>
              <t>
                Support for IMAP events in Sieve requires support for
                IMAP Metadata <xref target="RFC5464"/>
                as well, since the latter is used to associate scripts with IMAP
                mailboxes.
              </t>
              <t>
                When an applicable event occurs on an IMAP mailbox, if there is an
                IMAP metadata entry named "/shared/imapsieve/script" for the mailbox, that entry
                is used.  If there is not, but there is an IMAP metadata entry named
                "/shared/imapsieve/script" for the server, that entry is used (providing a way
                to define a global script for all mailboxes on a server).  If neither entry
                exists, then no script will be invoked.
              </t>
              <t>
                If a "/shared/imapsieve/script" metadata entry was selected above,
                its value is used as the name of the Sieve script
                that will be invoked in response to the IMAP event.
                If the value is empty, then no script is run.
                The selection of which metadata entry to use
                happens before any examination of the contents of the entry.  If the
                mailbox entry is selected and is then found to be unusable or
                empty, the server entry is not used as a backup: no script is run.
              </t>
              <t>
                This specifies the mechanism for "activating" a script for
                a given mailbox (or for all mailboxes), but does not specify a
                mechanism for creating, storing, or validating the script.
                Implementations MUST support ManageSieve <xref target="RFC5804"/>,
                and can use the PUTSCRIPT command
                to store the script without using the SETACTIVE command to activate it.
              </t>
              <t>
                Script names used in "/shared/imapsieve/script" metadata entries
                are the script names used on the corresponding ManageSieve server.
                If a "/shared/imapsieve/script" metadata entry contains a script name that
                doesn't exist in the ManageSieve server, then no Sieve script
                will be invoked for IMAP Sieve events.
              </t>
              <t>
                Only one Sieve script may currently be defined per mailbox, eliminating the
                complexity and possible ambiguity involved with coordinating the
                results of multiple scripts.  Any sub-filtering is done in the
                Sieve script.  For example, if it's only necessary to deal with
                flag changes, but not with new messages appended or copied, the
                Sieve script will still be invoked for all events, and the script
                is responsible for checking the event type.
              </t>
              <t>
                The possibility is open for an extension to add support for multiple
                scripts -- for example, per-client scripts on a multi-client user's inbox,
                or per-user scripts on a mailbox that is shared among users.
              </t>
              <t>
                Because this metadata name is associated with the mailbox,
                there can (and it's expected that there will) be different scripts
                associated with events for different mailboxes.  Indeed, most
                mailboxes will probably invoke no script at all.

        <section anchor="sieveactions" title="Applicable Sieve Actions and Interactions">
          <t>
            Since some Sieve actions relate specifically to the delivery of
            mail, not all actions and extensions make sense when the messages are created
            by other means or when changes are made to data associated with
            existing messages.  This section describes how actions in the base
            Sieve specification, and those in extensions known at this writing,
            relate to this specification.
          </t>
          <t>
            In addition to what is specified here, interactions noted
            in the individual specifications apply, and must be considered.
          </t>

          <section anchor="action-implicitkeep" title="The Implicit Keep">
            <t>
              For all cases that fall under IMAP events in Sieve, the implicit keep
              means that the message is treated as it would have been if no
              Sieve script were run.  For APPEND and COPY, the
              message is stored into the target mailbox normally.  For flag
              changes, the message is left in the mailbox.
              If actions have been taken that change the message, those
              changes are considered transient and MUST NOT be retained for any
              keep action (because IMAP messages are immutable).
              No error is generated, but the original message, without the changes, is kept.
            </t>
          </section>

          <section anchor="action-keep" title="The Keep Action">
            <t>
              The keep action is applicable in all cases that fall under IMAP events in Sieve.
              Its behaviour is as described for implicit keep, in <xref target="action-implicitkeep"/>.
            </t>
          </section>

          <section anchor="action-fileinto" title="The Fileinto Action">
            <t>
              If the Sieve implementation supports the fileinto action,
              that action is applicable in all cases that fall under IMAP events in Sieve.
              If the Copy extension <xref target="RFC3894"/> is available and
              the :copy option is specified, the implicit keep is retained;
              otherwise, fileinto cancels the implicit keep, as specified in
              the base Sieve specification.
            </t>
            <t>
              For APPEND and COPY, the message is stored into the
              fileinto mailbox IN ADDITION TO the original target mailbox.  For flag
              changes, the message is COPIED into the fileinto mailbox,
              without removing the original.
              In all cases, fileinto always creates a new message, separate from the original.
            </t>
            <t>
              The fileinto action is not an IMAP APPEND or COPY, and therefore does not
              result in a subsequent event (see also the Security Considerations,
              <xref target="security"/>).
            </t>
            <t>
              If a keep action is not also in effect,
              the original message is then marked with the \Deleted flag
              (see <xref target="deleted-flag"/>).
            </t>
          </section>

          <section anchor="action-redirect" title="The Redirect Action">
            <t>
              The redirect action is applicable in all cases that fall under IMAP events in Sieve.
              It causes the message to be sent, as specified in the base Sieve
              specification, to the designated address.
              If the Copy extension <xref target="RFC3894"/> is available and
              the :copy option is specified, the implicit keep is retained;
              otherwise, redirect cancels the implicit keep, as specified in
              the base Sieve specification.
            </t>
            <t>
              It's possible that a message processed in this way does not have
              the information necessary to be redirected properly.
              It might lack necessary header information, and there might not
              be appropriate information for the MAIL FROM command.
              In such cases, the "redirect" action uses
              Message Submission <xref target="RFC6409"/>, and it is up to the
              Sieve engine to supply the missing information.
              The redirect address is, of course, used for the "RCPT TO", and the
              "MAIL FROM" SHOULD be set to the address of the owner of the mailbox.
              The message submission server is allowed, according to the Message Submission
              protocol, to perform necessary fix-up to the message (see Section 8 of RFC 6409).
              It can also reject the submission attempt, if the message is too ill-formed
              for submission.
            </t>
            <t>
              For APPEND and COPY, the message is stored into
              the target mailbox in addition to being redirected.  For flag
              changes, the message remains in its original mailbox.
            </t>
            <t>
              If a keep action is not also in effect,
              the original message is then marked with the \Deleted flag
              (see <xref target="deleted-flag"/>).

          <section anchor="action-discard" title="The Discard Action">
            <t>
              The discard action is applicable in all cases that fall under IMAP events in Sieve.
              For APPEND and COPY, the message is first stored
              into the target mailbox.
              If an explicit keep action is also in effect,
              the discard action now does nothing.  Otherwise,
              the original message is then marked with the \Deleted flag

              notify action is applicable in all cases that fall under IMAP events in Sieve.
              The result is that the requested notification is sent, and that
              the message is otherwise handled as it would normally have been.

          <section anchor="action-addheader" title="The Addheader and Deleteheader Actions">
            <t>
              If the EditHeader extension <xref target="RFC5293"/> is available,
              it can be used to make transient changes to header fields,
              which aren't saved in place,
              such as for "redirect" or "fileinto" actions.
              Because messages in IMAP mailboxes are immutable, such changes
              are not applicable for the "keep" action (explicit or implicit).
              See <xref target="action-implicitkeep"/>.

            <t>
              Implementations of IMAP events in Sieve MUST also support
              the IMAP4Flags extension <xref target="RFC5232"/>, and
              the actions associated with it are all applicable to any case that
              falls under IMAP events in Sieve.
            </t>
            <t>
              It is worth noting also that the "hasflag" test that is defined in
              the IMAP4Flags extension might be particularly useful in scripts triggered
              by flag changes ("hasflag" will see the new, changed flags).
              The flag changes behave as though a client had
              made the change.
            </t>
            <t>
              As explained above, in order to avoid script loops
              flag changes that are made as a result of a script that was
              itself invoked because of flag changes SHOULD NOT result in
              another script invocation.  In any case, implementations MUST

            If the script is called for any message with the \Flagged
            flag set (tested through the IMAP4Flags extension <xref target="RFC5232"/>)
            AND this script invocation represents a change to that flag, then
            a notification is sent using the Notify extension <xref target="RFC5435"/>.
            No notification will be sent, though, if we're called with an
            existing message that already had that flag set.

        <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
          <t>
            It is possible to introduce script processing loops by having
            a Sieve script that is triggered by flag changes use the actions
            defined in the IMAP4Flags extension <xref target="RFC5232"/>.
            Implementations MUST take steps to prevent script loops.
            One way to avoid this problem is that if a script
            is invoked by flag changes, and that script further changes
            the flags, those flag changes SHOULD NOT trigger a Sieve script
            invocation.
          </t>
          <t>
            The fileinto action never results in the invocation of a script.
            If an implementation did invoke a script as the result of a fileinto,
            as though an IMAP APPEND or COPY had been done, script loops could result
            (mailbox A responds to all COPY events by doing "fileinto B",
            and mailbox B responds to all COPY events by doing "fileinto A").
            In general, actions taken as a result of the Sieve script are not IMAP
            events, and do not themselves trigger Sieve script invocations.
          </t>
          <t>
            It is also possible to introduce loops through the "redirect" or "notify"
            actions.  See Section 10 of Sieve <xref target="RFC5228"/>,
            Section 8 of Sieve Notify <xref target="RFC5435"/>,
            and the Security Considerations sections of the applicable
            notification-method documents for loop-prevention information.
            This extension does not change any of that advice.
          </t>
          <t>
            This extension introduces side-effects to IMAP commands
            that users and script authors might not be aware of and that
            can accidentally be triggered by an operation that the user would
            expect to be innocuous.
            In particular, certain actions, such as redirect, can cause a message
            (such as a  message appended to a mailbox by a user) to be sent to
            the Internet in response to something as simple as a flag change.
            For example, a script might cause messages
            marked for deletion to be sent to some off-site archiving service.
            If a user appends a draft message to a mailbox
            (perhaps an unencrypted draft message) and then marks it for deletion,
            it might be very surprising to the user that the message is sent off site.
            Script authors need to be careful not to create these kinds of surprises,
            especially when creating global scripts.
          </t>

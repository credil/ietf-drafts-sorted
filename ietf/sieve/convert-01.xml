      <t>
        This document describes how IMAP CONVERT can be used within Sieve
        to transform messages before final delivery.
      </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="Intro" title="Introduction" toc="default"> 
      <t>
        The IMAP CONVERT extension <xref target="RFC5259"/> adds an IMAP command for 
        performing client-controlled conversions on whole messages or their body parts.
        This document defines a similar extension to the Sieve mail filtering language
        <xref target="RFC5228"/>, which reuses the conversion parameters and framework 
        established by IMAP CONVERT.
      </t>
      
      <section title="Conventions Used in this Document">
        <t>
          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
          "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
          document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
          <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
        </t>        
        <t>
          Conventions for notations are as in Sieve <xref target="RFC5228"/> section 1.1,
          including the use of ABNF <xref target="RFC5234"/>.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title='"convert" action'>
      <t>
        <list style="hanging" hangIndent="8">
          <t hangText="Usage: convert">
            &lt;quoted-from-mime-type: string&gt;<vspace/>
            &lt;quoted-to-mime-type: string&gt;<vspace/>
            &lt;transcoding-params: string-list&gt;
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        The "convert" action specifies that body parts with "quoted-from-mime-type"
        MIME type be converted to "quoted-to-mime-type" MIME type using
        conversion parameters specified in "transcoding-params". Each conversion parameter
        value has the following syntax: "&lt;transcoding-param&gt;=&lt;transcoding-param-value&gt;",
        where &lt;transcoding-param&gt; and &lt;transcoding-param-value&gt; are defined in CONVERT
        <xref target="RFC5259"/>.
        Messages that don't have any body parts with the "quoted-from-mime-type" MIME type
        are not affected by the conversion.
      </t>
      <t>
        The "convert" action can be used with Sieve MIME Part Tests <xref target="RFC5703"/>,
        in the case that some, but not all of the body parts need to be converted, or
        where different body parts might require different conversions.
        When the "convert" action appears in a "foreverypart" loop,
        it applies only to the body part being processed, and not to any other
        body parts (see <xref target="Example2"/> for an example).
      </t>     
      <t>
        When the "convert" action appears outside a "foreverypart" loop, the conversion
        applies equally to all body parts -- that is, all body parts that have the
        "quoted-from-mime-type" are converted, using the same transcoding parameters.
      </t>     
      <t>
        Implementations ought to defer any actual conversion until the final resolution of other
        actions, to avoid doing conversions unnecessarily in cases where the message is not
        retained (such as where the resolution is "discard").
      </t>
      <section title='Interaction with other actions'>
        <t>
          Whether the actual conversion has been done yet or not, a "convert" action
          effectively changes the message, and all subsequent actions, including any other
          "convert" actions, apply to the changed message.
          The "convert" action does not affect the applicability of other actions; any
          action that was applicable before the "convert" is equally applicable to the
          changed message afterward.
        </t>
        <t>
          All conversions are performed before any disposition-type actions.
          Therefore, the sequence "convert, fileinto, convert" is the same as
          "convert, convert, fileinto": in both cases, all conversions are done
          before the message is filed.
        </t>
        <t>
          Repeating for emphasis: note that disposition-type actions, such as
          "fileinto" and "redirect", will work on the converted message,
          filing or redirecting it after all conversions are done.
        </t>
        <t>
          See <xref target="Example4"/> for an example of how this might be tricky.
        </t>

    <section title="Examples">
      <section anchor="Example1" title="Example 1">
        <t>
          In the following example, all "image/tiff" body parts of the message
          are converted to "image/jpeg" with image resolution of 320x240 pixels.
          The message is then subject to the implicit keep.
        </t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="Example2" title="Example 2">
        <t>
          In the following example, all "image/tiff" body parts of the message
          are converted to "image/jpeg", as in Example 1.
          Those messages are then filed into a mailbox called "INBOX.pics".
          Other messages (those with no image/tiff body parts) are subject to the implicit keep.
        </t>

      <section anchor="Example3" title="Example 3">
        <t>
          In the following example, only "image/tiff" body parts with a Content-Disposition
          of "inline" are converted.  Matching parts that are larger than 500 kilobytes
          are converted using an image resolution of 640x480 pixels, and those smaller
          are converted to 320x240 pixels.
          The message disposition is not changed, so the implicit keep will be in effect
          unless something else in the script changes that.

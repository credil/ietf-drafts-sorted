        This specification defines bindings, and the BIND method for creating
        multiple bindings to the same resource.  Creating a new binding to a
        resource causes at least one new URI to be mapped to that resource.  Servers
        are required to ensure the integrity of any bindings that they
        allow to be created.

<section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
<t>
  This specification extends the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol (<xref target="RFC4918"/>) to enable
  clients to create new access paths to existing resources.  This capability is
  useful for several reasons:
</t>
<t>
  URIs of WebDAV-compliant resources are hierarchical and correspond to a hierarchy
  of collections in resource space.  The WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol
  makes it possible to organize these resources into hierarchies, placing them
  into groupings, known as collections, which are more easily browsed and
  manipulated than a single flat collection.  However, hierarchies require
  categorization decisions that locate resources at a single location in the
  hierarchy, a drawback when a resource has multiple valid categories.  For
  example, in a hierarchy of vehicle descriptions containing collections for
  cars and boats, a description of a combination car/boat vehicle could belong
  in either collection.  Ideally, the description should be accessible from both.
  Allowing clients to create new URIs that access the existing resource lets
  them put that resource into multiple collections.
</t>
<t>
  Hierarchies also make resource sharing more difficult, since resources that
  have utility across many collections are still forced into a single collection.
  For example, the mathematics department at one university might create a
  collection of information on fractals that contains bindings to some local
  resources, but also provides access to some resources at other universities.  For
  many reasons, it may be undesirable to make physical copies of the shared
  resources on the local server: to conserve disk space, to respect copyright 
  constraints, or to make any changes in the shared resources visible
  automatically.  Being able to create new access paths to existing resources in 
  other collections or even on other servers is useful for this sort of case.
</t>
<t>
  The BIND method defined here provides a mechanism for allowing clients to
  create alternative access paths to existing WebDAV resources.  HTTP 
  <xref target="RFC2616"/> and WebDAV <xref target="RFC4918"/>
  methods are able to work because there are mappings between URIs and resources.  A
  method is addressed to a URI, and the server follows the mapping from that
  URI to a resource, applying the method to that resource.  Multiple URIs may be
  mapped to the same resource, but until now there has been no way for clients
  to create additional URIs mapped to existing resources. 
</t>
<t>
  BIND lets clients associate a new URI with an existing WebDAV resource, and
  this URI can then be used to submit requests to the resource.  Since URIs of
  WebDAV resources are hierarchical, and correspond to a hierarchy of
  collections in resource space, the BIND method also has the effect of adding
  the resource to a collection.  As new URIs are associated with the resource,
  it appears in additional collections.
</t>

<t>
  A BIND request does not create a new resource, but simply makes available a
  new URI for submitting requests to an existing resource.  The new URI is
  indistinguishable from any other URI when submitting a request to a resource.  Only 
  one round trip is needed to submit a request to the intended target.
  Servers are required to enforce the integrity of the relationships between
  the new URIs and the resources associated with them.  Consequently, it may be
  very costly for servers to support BIND requests that cross server boundaries.
</t>
<t>
  This specification is organized as follows.  <xref target="terminology"/> defines terminology
  used in the rest of the specification, while <xref target="overview.of.bindings"/> overviews bindings.
  <xref target="properties"/> defines the new properties needed to support multiple bindings to
  the same resource.  <xref target="METHOD_BIND"/> specifies the BIND method, used to create
  multiple bindings to the same resource.  <xref target="METHOD_UNBIND"/> specifies the UNBIND
  method, used to remove a binding to a resource.  <xref target="METHOD_REBIND"/> specifies the
  REBIND method, used to move a binding to another collection.  
</t>

<section title="Terminology" anchor="terminology">

  Authoring Protocol specification <xref target="RFC4918"/>.

  <iref item="URI Mapping" primary="true"/>
  <?rfc needLines="4"?>URI Mapping
  <list><t>
    A relation between an absolute URI and a resource.  For an absolute URI U
    and the resource it identifies R, the URI mapping can be thought of as
    (U =&gt; R).  Since a resource can represent items that are not network
    retrievable, as well as those that are, it is possible for a resource to
    have zero, one, or many URI mappings.  Mapping a resource to an "http"
    scheme URI makes it possible to submit HTTP protocol requests to the
    resource using the URI.
  </t></list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="Path Segment" primary="true"/>
  
<?rfc needLines="4" ?><?rfc needLines="4"?>Path Segment
  <list><t>
    Informally, the characters found between slashes ("/") in a URI.
    Formally, as defined in Section 3.3 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>.
  </t></list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="Binding" primary="true"/>
  <?rfc needLines="4"?>Binding
  <list><t>
    A relation between a single path segment (in a collection) and a resource.  A
    binding is part of the state of a collection.  If two different
    collections contain a binding between the same path segment and the same
    resource, these are two distinct bindings.  So for a collection C, a path
    segment S, and a resource R, the binding can be thought of as C:(S -&gt; R).
    Bindings create URI mappings, and hence allow requests to be sent to a
    single resource from multiple locations in a URI namespace.  For example,
    given a collection C (accessible through the URI 
    http://www.example.com/CollX), a path segment S (equal to "foo.html"), and 
    a resource R, then creating the binding C: (S -&gt; R) makes it possible to
    use the URI http://www.example.com/CollX/foo.html to access R.
  </t></list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="Collection" primary="true"/>
  <?rfc needLines="4"?>Collection
  <list><t>
    A resource that contains, as part of its state, a set of bindings that 
    identify internal member resources.
  </t></list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="Internal Member URI" primary="true"/>
  <?rfc needLines="4"?>Internal Member URI
  <list><t>
    The URI that identifies an internal member of a collection, and that
    consists of the URI for the collection, followed by a slash character
    ('/'), followed by the path segment of the binding for that internal member.
  </t></list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="Binding Integrity" primary="true"/>
  <?rfc needLines="4"?>Binding Integrity
  <list><t>
    The property of a binding that says that:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>the binding continues to exist, and</t>
      <t>the identity of the resource identified by that binding does not change</t>
    </list>
    unless an explicit request is executed that is defined to delete that
    binding (examples of requests that delete a binding are DELETE, MOVE, and
    - defined later on - UNBIND, and REBIND).
  </t></list>

<section title="Method Preconditions and Postconditions" anchor="method.preconditions.and.postconditions">

<t>
  See Section 16 of <xref target="RFC4918"/> for the
  definitions of "precondition" and "postcondition". 
</t>

</section>
</section>

<section title="Overview of Bindings" anchor="overview.of.bindings">
<t>
  Bindings are part of the state of a collection.  They define the internal
  members of the collection, and the names of those internal members.
</t>
<t>
  Bindings are added and removed by a variety of existing HTTP methods.  A
  method that creates a new resource, such as PUT, COPY, and MKCOL, adds a
  binding.  A method that deletes a resource, such as DELETE, removes a
  binding.  A method that moves a resource (e.g. MOVE) both adds a binding
  (in the destination collection) and removes a binding (in the source
  collection).  The BIND method introduced here provides a mechanism for
  adding a second binding to an existing resource.  There is no difference
  between an initial binding added by PUT, COPY, or MKCOL, and additional
  bindings added with BIND.
</t>

<t>
  It would be very undesirable if one binding could be destroyed as a side
  effect of operating on the resource through a different binding.  In
  particular, the removal of one binding to a resource (e.g. with a DELETE or
  a MOVE) MUST NOT disrupt another binding to that resource, e.g. by turning
  that binding into a dangling path segment.  The server MUST NOT reclaim
  system resources after removing one binding, while other bindings to the
  resource remain.  In other words, the server MUST maintain the integrity<iref item="Binding Integrity"/> of
  a binding.  It is permissible, however, for future method definitions (e.g., a 
  DESTROY method) to have semantics that explicitly remove all bindings 
  and/or immediately reclaim system resources.
</t>

<section title="Bindings to Collections" anchor="bindings.to.collections">


<t>
  Creating a new binding to a collection makes each resource associated with
  a binding in that collection accessible via a new URI, and thus creates new
  URI mappings to those resources but no new bindings.
</t>
<t>
  For example, suppose a new binding CollY is created for collection C1 in the
  figure below.  It immediately becomes possible to access resource R1 using
  the URI /CollY/x.gif and to access resource R2 using the URI /CollY/y.jpg,
  but no new bindings for these child resources were created.  This is because
  bindings are part of the state of a collection, and associate a URI that
  is relative to that collection with its target resource.  No change to the
  bindings in Collection C1 is needed to make its children accessible using
  /CollY/x.gif and /CollY/y.jpg.

<section title="Bind Loops" anchor="bind.loops">


<t>
  Bindings to collections can result in loops ("cycles"), which servers MUST detect when
  processing "Depth: infinity" requests.  It is sometimes possible to complete
  an operation in spite of the presence of a loop.  For instance, a PROPFIND
  can still succeed if the server uses the new status code
  208 (Already Reported) defined in <xref target="status.208.already.reported"/>.
</t>
<t>  
  However, the 506 (Loop Detected) status code is defined in <xref target="status.506.loop.detected"/> for use in contexts where an
  operation is terminated because a loop was encountered.
</t>

<t>
  Support for loops is OPTIONAL: servers MAY reject
  requests that would lead to the creation of a bind loop (see DAV:cycle-allowed
  precondition defined in <xref target="METHOD_BIND"/>).
</t>

</section>


</section>

<section title="URI Mappings Created by a new Binding" anchor="uri.mappings.created.by.a.new.binding">
<t>
  Suppose a binding from "Binding-Name" to resource R is to be added to a
  collection, C.  Then if C-MAP is the set of URIs that were mapped to C
  before the BIND request, then for each URI "C-URI" in C-MAP, the URI
  "C-URI/Binding-Name" is mapped to resource R following the BIND request.
</t>
<figure><preamble>
  For example, if a binding from "foo.html" to R is added to a collection C,
  and if the following URIs are mapped to C:
</preamble><artwork type="example"><![CDATA[
http://www.example.com/A/1/
http://example.com/A/one/
]]></artwork></figure>
<figure><preamble>
  then the following new mappings to R are introduced:
</preamble><artwork type="example"><![CDATA[
http://www.example.com/A/1/foo.html
http://example.com/A/one/foo.html
]]></artwork></figure>
<t>
  Note that if R is a collection, additional URI mappings are created to the
  descendents of R.  Also, note that if a binding is made in collection C to C
  itself (or to a parent of C), an infinite number of mappings are introduced.
</t>
<figure><preamble>
  For example, if a binding from "myself" to C is then added to C, the
  following infinite number of additional mappings to C are introduced:
</preamble><artwork type="example"><![CDATA[
http://www.example.com/A/1/myself
http://www.example.com/A/1/myself/myself
   ...
]]></artwork></figure>
<figure><preamble>
  and the following infinite number of additional mappings to R are introduced:
</preamble><artwork type="example"><![CDATA[
http://www.example.com/A/1/myself/foo.html
http://www.example.com/A/1/myself/myself/foo.html
   ...
]]></artwork></figure>
</section> 
 
<section title="COPY and Bindings" anchor="copy.and.bindings">
<t>
  As defined in Section 9.8 of <xref target="RFC4918"/>, COPY causes the resource identified
  by the Request-URI to be duplicated, and makes the new resource accessible 
  using the URI specified in the Destination header.  Upon successful
  completion of a COPY, a new binding is created between the last path
  segment of the Destination header, and the destination resource.  The new
  binding is added to its parent collection, identified by the Destination
  header minus its final segment.
</t>
<figure><preamble>
  The following figure shows an example: Suppose that a COPY is issued to
  URI-3 for resource R (which is also mapped to URI-1 and URI-2), with the
  Destination header set to URI-X.  After successful completion of the COPY
  operation, resource R is duplicated to create resource R', and a new binding
  has been created which creates at least the URI mapping between URI-X and
  the new resource (although other URI mappings may also have been created).
</preamble><artwork align="center" type="drawing"><![CDATA[
URI-1   URI-2    URI-3                           URI-X
   |       |        |                              |
   |       |        |   <---- URI Mappings ---->   |
   |       |        |                              |
+---------------------+                 +------------------------+
|     Resource R      |                 |     Resource R'        |
+---------------------+                 +------------------------+
]]></artwork></figure>
<t>
  It might be thought that a COPY request with "Depth: 0" on a collection would
  duplicate its bindings, since bindings are part of the collection's state.
  This is not the case, however.  The definition of Depth in <xref target="RFC4918"/> makes it
  clear that a "Depth: 0" request does not apply to a collection's members.
  Consequently, a COPY with "Depth: 0" does not duplicate the bindings
  contained by the collection.
</t>

<t>
  If a COPY request causes an existing resource to be updated, the bindings to
  that resource MUST be unaffected by the COPY request.  Using the preceding
  example, suppose that a COPY request is issued to URI-X for resource R', with
  the Destination header set to URI-2.  The content and dead properties of
  resource R would be updated to be a copy of those of resource R', but the
  mappings from URI-1, URI-2, and URI-3 to resource R remain unaffected.
  If because of multiple bindings to a resource, more than one source resource
  updates a single destination resource, the order of the updates is server
  defined (see
  <xref target="example.copy.multiple.update"/> for an example).
</t>

<t>
  If a COPY request would cause a new resource to be created as a copy of an
  existing resource, and that COPY request has already created a copy of that
  existing resource, the COPY request instead creates another binding to the
  previous copy, instead of creating a new resource (see
  <xref target="example.copy.graph"/> for an example).
</t>

<section title="DELETE and Bindings" anchor="delete.and.bindings">
<t>
  When there are multiple bindings to a resource, a DELETE applied to that
  resource MUST NOT remove any bindings to that resource other than the one
  identified by the Request-URI.  For example, suppose the collection
  identified by the URI "/a" has a binding named "x" to a resource R, and
  another collection identified by "/b" has a binding named "y" to the same
  resource R.  Then a DELETE applied to "/a/x" removes the binding named "x"
  from "/a" but MUST NOT remove the binding named "y" from "/b" (i.e. after the
  DELETE, "/y/b" continues to identify the resource R).
</t>
<t>
  When DELETE is applied to a collection, it MUST NOT modify the membership
  of any other collection that is not itself a member of the collection being
  deleted.  For example, if both "/a/.../x" and "/b/.../y" identify the same
  collection, C, then applying DELETE to "/a" must not delete an internal
  member from C or from any other collection that is a member of C, because
  that would modify the membership of "/b". 
</t>
<t>
  If a collection supports the UNBIND method (see <xref target="METHOD_UNBIND"/>), a DELETE of an
  internal member of a collection MAY be implemented as an UNBIND request.
  In this case, applying DELETE to a Request-URI has the effect of removing
  the binding identified by the final segment of the Request-URI from the
  collection identified by the Request-URI minus its final segment.  Although
  <xref target="RFC4918"/> allows a DELETE to be a non-atomic operation, when the DELETE
  operation is implemented as an UNBIND, the operation is atomic.  In
  particular, a DELETE on a hierarchy of resources is simply the removal of a
  binding to the collection identified by the Request-URI. 
</t>
</section>

<section title="MOVE and Bindings" anchor="move.and.bindings">
<t>
  When MOVE is applied to a resource, the other bindings to that resource
  MUST be unaffected, and if the resource being moved is a collection, the
  bindings to any members of that collection MUST be unaffected.  Also, if MOVE
  is used with Overwrite:T to delete an existing resource, the constraints
  specified for DELETE apply.
</t>
<t>
  If the destination collection of a MOVE request supports the REBIND method
  (see <xref target="METHOD_REBIND"/>), a MOVE of a resource into that collection MAY be implemented
  as a REBIND request.  Although <xref target="RFC4918"/> allows a MOVE to be a non-atomic
  operation, when the MOVE operation is implemented as a REBIND, the operation
  is atomic.  In particular, applying a MOVE to a Request-URI and a Destination
  URI has the effect of removing a binding to a resource (at the Request-URI),
  and creating a new binding to that resource (at the Destination URI).  
  Even when the
  Request-URI identifies a collection, the MOVE operation involves only
  removing one binding to that collection and adding another.
</t>

<section title="Example: Simple MOVE">
<t>
  As an example, suppose that a MOVE is issued to URI-3 for resource R below
  (which is also mapped to URI-1 and URI-2), with the Destination header set
  to URI-X.  After successful completion of the MOVE operation, a new binding
  has been created which creates the URI mapping between URI-X and resource R.  The 
  binding corresponding to the final segment of URI-3 has been removed,
  which also causes the URI mapping between URI-3 and R to be removed.  If
  resource R were a collection, old URI-3 based mappings to members of R
  would have been removed, and new URI-X based mappings to members of R would
  have been created.

<section title="PROPFIND and Bindings">

<t>
  Consistent with <xref target="RFC4918"/>, the value of a dead property MUST be independent of the number of bindings to
  its host resource or of the path submitted to PROPFIND.  On the other hand, the behavior
  for each live property depends on its individual definition (for example, see <xref target="RFC3744"/>, Section 5, paragraph 2
  for a case where the value is independent of path and bindings, and
  <xref target="RFC4918"/>, Section 8.8 for a discussion about the
  live properties DAV:getetag and DAV:getlastmodified, which may behave
  differently).
</t>
</section>







<section title="Determining Whether Two Bindings Are to the Same Resource" anchor="determining.whether.two.bindings.are.to.the.same.resource">
<t>
  It is useful to have some way of determining whether two bindings are to the
  same resource.  Two resources might have identical contents and properties,
  but not be the same resource (e.g. an update to one resource does not affect
  the other resource).
</t>
<t>
  The REQUIRED DAV:resource-id property defined in <xref target="PROPERTY_resource-id"/> is a resource
  identifier, which MUST be unique across all resources for all time.  If the
  values of DAV:resource-id returned by PROPFIND requests through two bindings
  are identical character by character, the client can be assured that the two bindings are to the
  same resource.
</t>
<t>
  The DAV:resource-id property is created, and its value assigned, when the
  resource is created.  The value of DAV:resource-id MUST NOT be changed.
  Even after the resource is no longer accessible through any URI, that value
  MUST NOT be reassigned to another resource's DAV:resource-id property.
</t>
<t>
  Any method that creates a new resource MUST assign a new, unique value to
  its DAV:resource-id property. For example, a PUT applied to a null resource,
  COPY (when not overwriting an existing target) and 
  CHECKIN (see <xref target="RFC3253"/>, Section 4.4) must assign a new, unique value to the DAV:resource-id property
  of the new resource they create.
</t>
<t>
  On the other hand, any method that affects an existing resource 
  must not change the value of its DAV:resource-id property.  Specifically, a PUT or a
  COPY that updates an existing resource must not change the value of its
  DAV:resource-id property.  A REBIND, since it does not create a new resource,
  but only changes the location of an existing resource, must not change the
  value of the DAV:resource-id property.
</t>

<section title="Discovering the Bindings to a Resource" anchor="discovering.the.bindings.to.a.resource">
<t>
  An OPTIONAL DAV:parent-set property on a resource provides a list of the
  bindings that associate a collection and a URI segment with that resource.  If
  the DAV:parent-set property exists on a given resource, it MUST contain
  a complete list of all bindings to that resource that the client is
  authorized to see.  When deciding whether to support the DAV:parent-set
  property, server implementers / administrators should balance the benefits
  it provides against the cost of maintaining the property and the security
  risks enumerated in Sections 
  <xref target="private.locations.may.be.revealed" format="counter"/> and <xref target="parent-set.and.denial.of.service" format="counter"/>.

  A DAV:allprop PROPFIND request SHOULD NOT return any of the properties

  asking a server to compute all possible live properties, issues a DAV:allprop
  PROPFIND request.

  The DAV:resource-id property is a REQUIRED property that enables clients to
  determine whether two bindings are to the same resource.  The value of
  DAV:resource-id is a URI, and may use any registered URI scheme that
  guarantees the uniqueness of the value across all resources for all time
  (e.g. the urn:uuid: URN namespace defined in <xref target="RFC4122"/> or
  the opaquelocktoken: URI scheme defined in <xref target="RFC4918"/>).

  The DAV:parent-set property is an OPTIONAL property that enables clients to
  discover what collections contain a binding to this resource (i.e. what
  collections have that resource as an internal member).  It contains an  
  href/segment pair for each collection that has a binding to the resource.
  The href identifies the collection, and the segment identifies the binding
  name of that resource in that collection.
</t>

  A given collection MUST appear only once in the DAV:parent-set for any given
  binding, even if there are multiple URI mappings to that collection.

<section title="BIND Method" anchor="METHOD_BIND">
<iref item="BIND method" primary="true"/>
<iref item="Methods" subitem="BIND" primary="true"/>
<t>
  The BIND method modifies the collection identified by the Request-URI, by
  adding a new binding from the segment specified in the BIND body to the
  resource identified in the BIND body.
</t>
<t>
  If a server cannot guarantee the integrity<iref item="Binding Integrity"/> of the binding, the BIND request
  MUST fail.  Note that it is especially difficult to maintain the integrity of
  cross-server bindings.  Unless the server where the resource resides knows
  about all bindings on all servers to that resource, it may unwittingly
  destroy the resource or make it inaccessible without notifying another
  server that manages a binding to the resource.  For example, if server A
  permits creation of a binding to a resource on server B, server A must
  notify server B about its binding and must have an agreement with B that B
  will not destroy the resource while A's binding exists.  Otherwise server B
  may receive a DELETE request that it thinks removes the last binding to the
  resource and destroy the resource while A's binding still exists.
  The precondition DAV:cross-server-binding is defined below
  for cases where servers fail cross-server BIND requests because they cannot
  guarantee the integrity of cross-server bindings.
</t>
<t>
  By default, if there already is a binding for the specified segment in the
  collection, the new binding replaces the existing binding.  This default
  binding replacement behavior can be overridden using the Overwrite header
  defined in Section 10.6 of <xref target="RFC4918"/>.
</t>
<t>
   If a BIND request fails, the server state preceding the request MUST be restored.
   This method is unsafe and idempotent (see <xref target="RFC2616"/>, Section 9.1).

      If the request succeeds, the server MUST return 201 (Created) when a new

<t>
  The 208 (Already Reported) status code can be used inside a DAV:propstat
  response element to avoid enumerating the internal members of multiple
  bindings to the same collection repeatedly.  For each binding to a 
  collection inside the request's scope, only one will
  be reported with a 200 status, while subsequent DAV:response elements for all
  other bindings will use the 208 status, and no DAV:response elements for
  their descendants are included.
</t>
<t>
  Note that the 208 status will only occur for "Depth: infinity" requests,
  and that it is of particular importance when the multiple collection
  bindings cause a bind loop as discussed in <xref target="uri.mappings.created.by.a.new.binding"/>.
</t>
<t>
  A client can request the DAV:resource-id property in a PROPFIND request to
  guarantee that they can accurately reconstruct the binding structure of a
  collection with multiple bindings to a single resource.

<t>
  For backward compatibility with clients not aware of the 208 status code appearing
  in multistatus response bodies, it SHOULD NOT be used unless the client
  has signalled support for this specification using the "DAV" request
  header (see <xref target="dav.request.header"/>).  Instead, a 506 status should be returned 
  when a binding loop is discovered.
  This allows the server to return the 506 as the top level return status, 
  if it discovers it before it started the response, or in the middle of a 
  multistatus, if it discovers it in the middle of streaming out a 
  multistatus response. 
</t>

<section title="Relationship to Versioning Extensions to WebDAV">
<t>
  Servers that implement Workspaces (<xref target="RFC3253"/>, Section 6)

  already need to implement BIND-like behavior in order to handle UPDATE and
  UNCHECKOUT semantics.
</t>
<t>
  Consider a workspace "/ws1/", containing the version-controlled, checked-out
  collections C1 and C2, named "/ws1/CollX" and "/ws1/CollY",
  and a version-controlled resource R, bound to C1 as "/ws1/CollX/test":

  Moving "/ws1/CollX/test" into "/ws1/CollY", checking in C2, but undoing the

  The MOVE semantics defined in Section 3.15 of <xref target="RFC3253"/>
  already require that "/ws1/CollX/test" and "/ws1/CollY/test" will have the same 
  version history (as exposed in the DAV:version-history property). Furthermore,
  the UNCHECKOUT semantics (which in this case is similar to UPDATE, see
  Section 14.11 of <xref target="RFC3253"/>) require:
</t>
<t><list>
  <t>
    ...If a new version-controlled member is in a workspace that already has
    a version-controlled resource for that version history, then the new
    version-controlled member MUST be just a binding (i.e., another name for)
    that existing version-controlled resource...
  </t>
</list></t>
<t>
  Thus, "/ws1/CollX/test" and "/ws1/CollY/test" will be bindings to the same
  resource R, and have identical DAV:resource-id properties.

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security.considerations">

<t>
  This section is provided to make WebDAV implementors aware of the security
  implications of this protocol.
</t>
<t>
  All of the security considerations of HTTP/1.1 (<xref target="RFC2616"/>, Section 15) and the WebDAV Distributed
  Authoring Protocol specification (<xref target="RFC4918"/>, Section 20) also apply to this protocol specification.
  In addition, bindings introduce several new security concerns and increase
  the risk of some existing threats.  These issues are detailed below.
</t>

<section title="Privacy Concerns" anchor="privacy.concerns">
<t>
  In a context where cross-server bindings are supported, creating bindings on
  a trusted server may make it possible for a hostile agent to induce users to
  send private information to a target on a different server.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Bind Loops" anchor="bind.loops.privacy.concerns">
<t>
  Although bind loops were already possible in HTTP 1.1, the introduction
  of the BIND method creates a new avenue for clients to create loops
  accidentally or maliciously.  If the binding and its target are on the same
  server, the server may be able to detect BIND requests that would create
  loops.  Servers are required to detect loops that are caused by bindings to
  collections during the processing of any requests with "Depth: infinity".
</t>
</section>

<section title="Bindings, and Denial of Service" anchor="bindings.and.denial.of.service">
<t>
  Denial of service attacks were already possible by posting URIs that were
  intended for limited use at heavily used Web sites.  The introduction of
  BIND creates a new avenue for similar denial of service attacks.  If
  cross-server bindings are supported, clients can now create bindings at 
  heavily used sites to target locations that were not designed for heavy usage.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Private Locations May Be Revealed" anchor="private.locations.may.be.revealed">
<t>
  If the DAV:parent-set property is maintained on a resource, the owners of
  the bindings risk revealing private locations.  The directory structures
  where bindings are located are available to anyone who has access to the
  DAV:parent-set property on the resource.  Moving a binding may reveal its
  new location to anyone with access to DAV:parent-set on its resource.
</t>
</section>

<section title="DAV:parent-set and Denial of Service" anchor="parent-set.and.denial.of.service">
<t>
  If the server maintains the DAV:parent-set property in response to bindings
  created in other administrative domains, it is exposed to hostile attempts to
  make it devote resources to adding bindings to the list.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Internationalization Considerations" anchor="internationalization.considerations">
<t>
  All internationalization considerations mentioned in Section 19 of <xref target="RFC4918"/> also apply to
  this document.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Clarification to RFC4918 Usage of the Term 'Lock Root'">

<t>
  <xref target="RFC4918"/>, Section 9.10.1
  claims:
</t>
<t><list>
  <t>
 A LOCK request to an existing resource will create a lock on the
 resource identified by the Request-URI, provided the resource is not
 already locked with a conflicting lock.  The resource identified in
 the Request-URI becomes the root of the lock.
  </t>
</list></t>
<t>
  
  This is misleading in that it implies that the "lock root" is the directly
  locked resource, not the URI through which the lock was requested (see 
  <eref target="http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?eid=1207"/>). As
  a matter of fact, other parts of the specification use the term "lock-root"
  to talk about that URI (see <xref target="RFC4918"/>, Section 6.1, Item 2,
  and Section 14.12). With that definition,
  it becomes clear that a lock affects the resource identified by the Request-URI
  (plus optionally its descendants), plus the URI through which the lock
  was requested, but not URIs mapped to that resource due to the existence of
  additional bindings.
</t>
<t>  
  A clearer description would be:
  <list>
    <t>
 A LOCK request to an existing resource will create a lock on the
 resource identified by the Request-URI, provided the resource is not
 already locked with a conflicting lock.  The Request-URI becomes the 
 "lock-root" of the lock.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  Note that this change makes the description consistent with the
  definition of the DAV:lockroot XML element in Section 14.12 of <xref target="RFC4918"/>.
</t>

<section title="Example: Locking and Multiple Bindings">
<t>
  This example shows how the clarification above is relevant when a locked resource
  is addressable through multiple URIs.
</t>
<t>
  Consider a root collection "/", containing the two collections C1 and
  C2, named "/CollX" and "/CollY", and a child resource R, bound to C1 as
  "/CollX/test" and bound to C2 as "/CollY/test":
</t>
<figure><artwork align="center" type="drawing" xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
     +-------------------------+
     | Root Collection         |
     |  bindings:              |
     |  CollX          CollY   |
     +-------------------------+
         |                |          
         |                |
         |                |
+---------------+  +---------------+
| Collection C1 |  | Collection C2 |
| bindings:     |  | bindings:     |
|     test      |  |     test      |
+---------------+  +---------------+
         |               |
         |               |  
         |               |  
        +------------------+
        |    Resource R    |
        +------------------+
]]></artwork></figure>
<t>
  Given a host name of "www.example.com", applying a depth-zero write lock to
  "/CollX/test" will lock the resource R, and the lock-root of this lock will
  be "http://www.example.com/CollX/test".
</t>
<t>
  Thus the following operations will require that the associated lock token is
  submitted with the "If" request header
  (<xref target="RFC4918"/>, Section 10.4):
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>a PUT or PROPPATCH request modifying the content or lockable properties of resource
    R (as R is locked) -- no matter which URI is used as request target,</t>
    <t>a MOVE, REBIND, UNBIND or DELETE request causing "/CollX/test" not being mapped to resource R anymore (be it
    addressed to "/CollX" or "/CollX/test").</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  The following operations will not require submission of the lock token:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>a DELETE request addressed to "/CollY" or /CollY/test", as it does not
    affect the resource R, nor the lock-root,</t>
    <t>for the same reason, an UNBIND request removing the binding "test" from collection C2, or the
    binding "CollY" from the root collection,</t>
    <t>similarly, a MOVE or REBIND request causing "/CollY/test" not being mapped
    to resource R anymore.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  Note that despite the lock root being "http://www.example.com/CollX/test", an UNLOCK request can
  be addressed through any URI mapped to resource R, as UNLOCK operates on the
  resource identified by the request URI, not that URI (see <xref target="RFC4918"/>, Section 9.11).

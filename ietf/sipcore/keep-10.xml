				This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Via header field parameter, 
				"keep", which allows adjacent SIP entities to explicitly negotiate usage of the Network 
				Address Translation (NAT) keep-alive mechanisms defined in SIP Outbound, in cases where SIP 
				Outbound is not supported, cannot be applied, or where usage of keep-alives is not implicitly 
				negotiated as part of the SIP Outbound negotiation.

		<section title="Introduction" toc="default">
			<t>
				Section 3.5 of SIP Outbound <xref target="RFC5626" pageno="false" format="default" /> defines 
				two keep-alive mechanisms. Even though the keep-alive mechanisms are separated from the rest of 
				the SIP Outbound mechanism, SIP Outbound does not define a mechanism to explicitly negotiate 
				usage of the keep-alive mechanisms. In some cases usage of keep-alives can be implicitly negotiated 
				as part of the SIP Outbound negotiation. 
			</t>
			<t>
				However, there are SIP Outbound use-cases where usage of keep-alives is not implicitly negotiated 
				as part of the SIP Outbound negotiation. In addition, there are cases where SIP Outbound is not 
				supported, or where it cannot be applied, but where there is still a need to be able to negotiate 
				usage of keep-alives. Last, <xref target="RFC5626" pageno="false" format="default" /> only allows 
				keep-alives to be negotiated between a UA and an edge proxy, and not between other SIP entities.
			</t>
			<t>
				This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261" pageno="false" 
				format="default" /> Via header field parameter, "keep", which allows adjacent SIP entities to 
				explicitly negotiate usage of the NAT keep-alive mechanisms defined in SIP Outbound. The "keep" 
				parameter allows SIP entities to indicate willingness to send keep-alives, to indicate willingness 
				to receive keep-alives, and for SIP entities willing to receive keep-alives to provide a recommended 
				keep-alive frequency.
			</t>
			<t>
				The following sections describe use-cases where a mechanism to explicitly negotiate usage of 
				keep-alives is needed.
			</t>
			<section title="Use-case: Dialog from non-registered UAs" toc="default">
				<t>
					In some cases a User Agent Client (UAC) does not register itself before it establishes a 
					dialog, but in order to maintain NAT bindings open during the lifetime of the dialog it still 
					needs to be able to negotiate sending of keep-alives towards its adjacent downstream SIP entity. 
					A typical example is an emergency call, where a registration is not always required in order 
					to make the call.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Use-case: SIP Outbound not supported" toc="default">
				<t>
					In some cases all SIP entities that need to be able to negotiate the usage of keep-alives 
					might not support SIP Outbound. However, they might still support the keep-alive mechanisms 
					defined in SIP Outbound, and need to be able to negotiate usage of them.
				</t>

			<section title="Use-case: SIP dialog initiated Outbound flows" toc="default">
				<t>
					SIP Outbound allows the establishment of flows using the initial request for a dialog. 
					As specified in <xref target="RFC5626" pageno="false" format="default" />, usage of keep-alives

			<section title="General" anchor="sec-sipent-gen" toc="default">
				<t>
					This section describes how SIP UAs and proxies negotiate usage of keep-alives associated 
					with a registration, or a dialog, which types of SIP requests can be used in order to negotiate 
					the usage, and the lifetime of the negotiated keep-alives.
				</t>
				<t>
					SIP entities indicate willingness to send keep-alives towards the adjacent downstream 
					SIP entity using SIP requests. The associated responses are used by SIP entities to indicate 
					willingness to receive keep-alives. SIP entities that indicate willingness to receive 
					keep-alives can provide a recommended keep-alive frequency.
				</t>
				<t>
					The procedures to negotiate usage of keep-alives are identical for SIP UAs and proxies.
				</t>
				<t>
					In general, it can be useful for SIP entities to indicate willingness to send keep-alives, 
					even if they are not aware of any necessity for them to send keep-alives, since the adjacent 
					downstream SIP entity might have knowledge about the necessity. Similarly, if the adjacent 
					upstream SIP entity has indicated willingness to send keep-alives, it can be useful for SIP 
					entities to indicate willingness to receive keep-alives, even if they are not aware of any 
					necessity for the adjacent upstream SIP entity to send them.				
				</t>
				<t> 
					NOTE: Usage of keep-alives is negotiated per direction. If a SIP entity has indicated 
					willingness to receive keep-alives from an adjacent SIP entity, sending of keep-alives towards 
					the same SIP entity needs to be separately negotiated.
				</t>				
				<t>
					NOTE: Since there are SIP entities that already use a combination of Carriage Return and 
					Line Feed (CRLF) as keep-alive messages, and SIP entities are expected to be able to receive 
					those, this specification does not forbid the sending of double-CRLF keep-alive messages towards 
					an adjacent SIP entity even if usage of keep-alives with that SIP entity has not been negotiated. 
					However, the "keep" parameter is still important in order for a SIP entity to indicate that it 
					supports sending of double-CRLF keep-alive messages, so that the adjacent downstream SIP entity 
					does not use other mechanisms (e.g. short registration refresh intervals) in order to keep NAT 
					bindings open.			
				</t>
			</section>			
			<section title="Lifetime of keep-alives" anchor="sec-scope" toc="default">
				<section title="General">
					<t>
						The lifetime of negotiated keep-alives depends on whether the keep-alives are associated 
						with a registration or a dialog. This section describes the lifetime of negotiated 
						keep-alives.														
					</t>
				</section>
				<section title="Keep-alives associated with registration">
					<t>						
						SIP entities use a registration request in order to negotiate usage of keep-alives 
						associated with a registration. Usage of keep-alives can be negotiated when the 
						registration is established, or later during the registration. Once negotiated, 
						keep-alives are sent until the registration is terminated, or until a subsequent 
						registration refresh request is sent or forwarded. When a subsequent registration 
						refresh request is sent or forwarded, if a SIP entity is willing to continue sending 
						keep-alives associated with the registration, usage of keep-alives MUST be re-negotiated. 
						If usage is not successfully re-negotiated, the SIP entity MUST cease sending of 
						keep-alives associated with the registration.
					</t>					
				</section>
				<section title="Keep-alives associated with dialog">
					<t>								
						SIP entities use an initial request for a dialog, or a mid-dialog target refresh 
						request <xref target="RFC3261" pageno="false" format="default"/>, in order to negotiate 
						sending and receiving of keep-alives associated with a dialog. Usage of keep-alives can 
						be negotiated when the dialog is established, or later during the lifetime of the dialog. 
						Once negotiated, keep-alives MUST be sent for the lifetime of the dialog, until the dialog 
						is terminated. Once usage of keep-alives associated with a dialog has been negotiated, it 
						is not possible to re-negotiate the usage associated with the dialog.
					</t>
				</section>	
			</section>
			<section title="Behavior of a SIP entity willing to send keep-alives" anchor="sec-sipent-send-reg" toc="default">
				<t>									
					As defined in <xref target="RFC5626" pageno="false" format="default" />, a SIP entity that 
					supports sending of keep-alives must act as a Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) 
					client <xref target="RFC5389" pageno="false" format="default" />. The SIP entity must 
					support those aspects of STUN that are required in order to apply the STUN keep-alive mechanism 
					defined in <xref target="RFC5626" pageno="false" format="default" />, and it must support the CRLF 
					keep-alive mechanism defined in <xref target="RFC5626" pageno="false" format="default" />.
					<xref target="RFC5626" pageno="false" format="default" /> defines when to use STUN, respectively 
					double-CRLF, for keep-alives.
				</t>
				<t>
					When a SIP entity sends or forwards a request, if it wants to negotiate the sending of keep-alives 
					associated with a registration, or a dialog, it MUST insert a "keep" parameter in the topmost Via header 
					field that it adds to the request, to indicate willingness to send keep-alives.
				</t>
				<t>
					When the SIP entity receives the associated response, if the "keep" parameter in the topmost Via header 
					field of the response contains a "keep" parameter value, it MUST start to send keep-alives towards 
					the same destination where it would send a subsequent request (e.g. REGISTER requests and initial 
					requests for dialog) associated with the registration (if the keep-alive negotiation is for 
					a registration), or where it would send subsequent mid-dialog requests (if the keep-alive 
					negotiation is for a dialog). Subsequent mid-dialog requests are addressed based on the dialog 
					route set.
				</t>
				<t>
					Once a SIP entity has negotiated sending of keep-alives associated with a dialog towards an 
					adjacent SIP entity, it MUST NOT insert a "keep" parameter in any subsequent SIP requests, 
					associated with the dialog, towards that adjacent SIP entity. Such "keep" parameter MUST be 
					ignored, if received.				
				</t>
				<t>
					Since an ACK request does not have an associated response, it can not be used to negotiate 
					usage of keep-alives. Therefore, a SIP entity MUST NOT insert a "keep" parameter in the 
					topmost Via header field of an ACK request. Such "keep" parameter MUST be ignored, if 
					received.
				</t>
				<t>
					A SIP entity MUST NOT indicates willingness to send keep-alives associated with a dialog, unless 
					it has also inserted itself in the dialog route set <xref target="RFC3261" pageno="false" 
					format="default" />.				
				</t>				
				<t>
					NOTE: When a SIP entity sends an initial request for a dialog, if the adjacent downstream 
					SIP entity does not insert itself in the dialog route set using a Record-Route header field 
					<xref target="RFC3261" pageno="false" format="default" />, the adjacent downstream SIP entity 
					will change once the dialog route set has been established. If a SIP entity inserts a "keep" 
					parameter in the topmost Via header field of an initial request for a dialog, and the "keep" parameter 
					in the associated response does not contain a parameter value, the SIP entity might choose 
					to insert a "keep" parameter in the topmost Via header field of a subsequent SIP request associated 
					with the dialog, in case the new adjacent downstream SIP entity (based on the dialog route set) 
					is willing to receive keep-alives (in which case it will add a parameter value to the "keep" 
					parameter).
				</t>
				<t>
					If an INVITE request is used to indicate willingness to send keep-alives, as long as at least 
					one response (provisional or final) to the INVITE request contains a "keep" parameter with 
					a parameter value, it is seen as an indication that the adjacent downstream SIP entity is 
					willing to receive keep-alives associated with the dialog on which the response is received.			
				</t>				
			</section>	
			<section title="Behavior of a SIP entity willing to receive keep-alives" anchor="sec-sipent-recv" toc="default">
				<t>									
					As defined in <xref target="RFC5626" pageno="false" format="default" />, a SIP entity 
					that supports receiving of keep-alives must act as a STUN server <xref target="RFC5389" 
					pageno="false" format="default" />. The SIP entity must support those aspects of STUN that 
					are required in order to apply the STUN keep-alive mechanism defined in <xref target="RFC5626" 
					pageno="false" format="default" />, and it must support the CRLF keep-alive mechanism defined 
					in <xref target="RFC5626" pageno="false" format="default" />.																
				</t>	
				<t>
					When a SIP entity sends or forwards a response, and the adjacent upstream SIP entity 
					indicated willingness to send keep-alives, if the SIP entity is willing to receive 
					keep-alives associated with the registration, or the dialog, from the adjacent upstream 
					SIP entity it MUST add a parameter value to the "keep" parameter, before sending or 
					forwarding the response. The parameter value, if present and with a value other than zero, 
					represents a recommended keep-alive frequency, given in seconds.
				</t>
				<t>
					There might be multiple responses to an INVITE request. When a SIP entity indicates willingness 
					to receive keep-alives in a response to an INVITE request, it MUST add a parameter value to the 
					"keep" parameter in at least one reliable response to the request. The SIP entity MAY add 
					identical parameter values  to the "keep" parameters in other responses to the same request.
					The SIP entity MUST NOT add different parameter value to the "keep" parameters in responses to 
					the same request. The SIP entity SHOULD indicate the willingness to receive keep-alives as soon 
					as possible.
				</t>
				<t>
					A SIP entity MUST NOT indicates willingness to receive keep-alives associated with a dialog, 
					unless it has also inserted itself in the dialog route set <xref target="RFC3261" pageno="false" 
					format="default" />.				
				</t>
			</section>
		</section>
						
		<section title="Keep-alive frequency" anchor="sec-keepalive-freq" toc="default">
			<t>		
				If a SIP entity receives a SIP response, where the topmost Via header field contains a "keep" parameter 
				with a non-zero value that indicates a recommended keep-alive frequency, given in seconds, it 
				MUST use the procedures defined for the Flow-Timer header field <xref target="RFC5626" pageno="false" 
				format="default" />. According to the procedures, the SIP entity must send keep-alives at least 
				as often as the indicated recommended keep-alive frequency, and if the SIP entity uses the 
				recommended keep-alive frequency then it should send its keep-alives so that the interval between 
				each keep-alive is randomly distributed between 80% and 100% of the recommended keep-alive frequency.
			</t>
			<t>
				If the received "keep" parameter value is zero, the SIP entity can send keep-alives at its 
				discretion. <xref target="RFC5626" pageno="false" format="default"/> provides additional guidance 
				on selecting the keep-alive frequency in case a recommended keep-alive frequency is not provided.
			</t>
			<t>
				This specification does not specify actions to take if negotiated keep-alives are not 
				received. As defined in <xref target="RFC5626" pageno="false" format="default"/>, the receiving 
				SIP entity may consider a connection to be dead in such situations.					
			</t>
			<t>
				If a SIP entity that adds a parameter value to the "keep" parameter, in order to indicate 
				willingness to receive keep-alives, also inserts a Flow-Timer header field (that can happen if the 
				SIP entity is using both the Outbound mechanism and the keep-alive mechanism) in the same SIP 
				message, the header field value and the "keep" parameter value MUST be identical.
			</t>
			<t>
				SIP Outbound uses the Flow-Timer header field to indicate the server-recommended keep-alive 
				frequency. However, it will only be sent between a UA and an edge proxy. Using the "keep" parameter, 
				however, the sending and receiving of keep-alives might be negotiated between multiple entities on 
				the signalling path. In addition, since the server-recommended keep-alive frequency might vary 
				between different SIP entities, a single Flow-Timer header field can not be used to indicate all 
				the different frequency values.  
			</t>
		</section>				
		
		<section title="Connection reuse" anchor="sec-conn-reuse" toc="default">
			<t>		
				Keep-alives are often sent in order to keep NAT bindings open, so that the NAT may be passed by SIP 
				requests sent in the reverse direction, reusing the same connection, or for non-connection-oriented 
				transport protocols, reusing the same path. This specification does not define such connection reuse 
				mechanism. The keep-alive mechanism defined in this specification is only used to negotiate the 
				sending and receiving of keep-alives. Entities that want to reuse connections need to use another 
				mechanism to ensure that security aspects associated with connection reuse are taken into 
				consideration.
			</t>
			<t>
				RFC 5923 <xref target="RFC5923" pageno="false" format="default"/> specifies a mechanism for using 
				connection-oriented transports to send requests in the reverse direction, and an entity that wants 
				to use connection-reuse as well as indicate support of keep-alives on that connection will insert 
				both the "alias" parameter defined in <xref target="RFC5923" pageno="false" format="default"/> as 
				well as the "keep" parameter defined in this specification.
			</t>
			<t>
				SIP Outbound specifies how registration flows are used to send requests in the reverse direction.

       				<t>
       					Figure 3 shows an example where Alice sends an initial INVITE request for a dialog. 
					She indicates willingness to send keep-alive by inserting a "keep" parameter in her Via 
					header field of the request. The edge proxy (P1) does not add itself to the dialog route 
					set, by adding itself to a Record-Route header field, before it forwards the request 
					towards Bob.
				</t>
				<t>
					When Alice receives the response, she determines from her Via header field that P1 is 
					not willing to receive keep-alives associated with the dialog from her. When the dialog 
					route set has been established, Alice sends a mid-dialog UPDATE request towards Bob 
					(since P1 did not insert itself in the dialog route set), and she once again indicates 
					willingness to send keep-alives by inserting a "keep" parameter in her Via header field 
					of the request. Bob supports the keep-alive mechanism, and is willing to receive keep-alives 
					associated with the dialog from Alice, so he creates a response and adds a "keep" parameter 
					value, which indicates a recommended keep-alive frequency of 30 seconds, to Alice's Via 
					header field, before he forwards the response towards Alice.
				</t>
				<t>
					When Alice receives the response, she determines from her Via header field that P1 is 
					willing to receive keep-alives associated with the dialog. For the lifetime of the dialog, 
					Alice then sends periodic keep-alives (in this example using the STUN keep-alive technique) 
					towards Bob, using the recommended keep-alive frequency indicated by the "keep" parameter 
					value.

    	<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sec-security" toc="default">
			<t>
				SIP entities that send or receive keep-alives are often required to use a connection 
				reuse mechanism, in order to ensure that requests sent in the reverse direction, towards 
				the sender of the keep-alives, traverse NATs etc. This specification does not specify a 
				connection reuse mechanism, and it does it address security issues related to connection 
				reuse. SIP entities that wish to reuse connections need to use a dedicated 
				connection reuse mechanism, in conjunction with the keep-alive negotiation mechanism.
			</t>
			<t>
				Unless SIP messages are integrity protected hop-by-hop (e.g. using TLS or DTLS), a 
				man-in-the-middle can modify Via header fields used by two entities to negotiate sending 
				of keep-alives, e.g. by removing the indications used to indicate willingness to send and 
				receive keep-alives, or by decreasing the timer value to a very low value, which might 
				trigger additional resource consumption due to the frequently sent keep-alives.
			</t>
			<t>
				The behavior defined in Sections 4.3 and 4.4 require a SIP entity using the mechanism defined 
				in this specification to place a value in the "keep" parameter in the topmost Via header field 
				value of a response the SIP entity sends. They do not instruct the enity to place a value in 
				a "keep" parameter of any request it forwards. In particular, SIP proxies MUST NOT place a 
				value into the keep parameter of the topmost Via header field value of a request it receives 
				before forwarding it. A SIP proxy implementing this specification SHOULD remove any keep 
				parameter values in any Via header field values below the topmost one in responses it 
				receives before forwarding them.
			</t>
			<t>
				When requests are forwarded across multiple hops, it is possible for a malicious downstream 
				SIP entity to tamper with the accrued values in the Via header field. The malicious SIP entity 
				could place a value, or change an existing value in a "keep" parameter in any of the Via 
				header field values, not just the topmost value. A proxy implementation that simply forwards 
				responses by stripping the topmost Via header field value and not inspecting the resulting 
				new topmost Via header field value risks being adversely affected by such a malicious downstream 
				SIP entity. In particular, such a proxy may start receiving STUN requests if it blindly forwards a 
				response with a keep parameter with a value it did not create in the topmost Via header field. 
				To lower the chances of the malicious SIP entity's actions having adverse affects on such proxies, 
				when a SIP entity sends STUN keep-alives to an adjacent downstream SIP entity and does not receive a 
				response to those STUN messages, it MUST stop sending the keep-alive requests for the remaining 
				duration of the dialog (if the sending of keep-alives were negotiated for a dialog) or until 
				the sending of keep-alives is re-negotiated for the registration (if the sending keep-alives 
				were negotiated for a registration).
			</t>			
			<t>
				Apart from the issues described above, this specification does not introduce security 
				considerations in addition to those specified for keep-alives in <xref target="RFC5626" 
				pageno="false" format="default"/>.

			This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) response code, 199 Early Dialog Terminated, 
			that a SIP forking proxy and a User Agent Server (UAS) can use to indicate towards upstream SIP entities (including the
			User Agent Client (UAC)) that an early dialog has been terminated, before a final response is sent towards the SIP entities.

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
		<t>
			As defined in RFC 3261 <xref target="RFC3261" pageno="false" format="default" />, a Session Initiation 
			Protocol (SIP) early dialog is created when a non-100 provisional response is sent to the initial dialog 
			initiation request (e.g. INVITE, outside an existing dialog). The dialog is considered to be in early state 
			until a final response is sent.
		</t>		
		<t>
			When a proxy receives an initial dialog initiation request, it can forward the request towards multiple remote 
			destinations. When the proxy does that, it performs forking <xref target="RFC3261" pageno="false" format="default" />.
		</t>
		<t>
			When a forking proxy receives a non-100 provisional response, or a 2xx final response, it forwards
			the response upstream towards the sender of the associated request. After a forking proxy has forwarded
			a 2xx final response, it normally generates and sends CANCEL requests downstream towards all remote 
			destinations where it previously forked the request associated with the 2xx final response and from which 
			it has yet not received a final response. The CANCEL requests are sent in order to terminate any outstanding
			early dialogs associated with the request. 
		</t>
		<t>
			Upstream SIP entities might receive multiple 2xx final responses. When a SIP entity receives the first 
			2xx final response, and it does not intend to accept any subsequent 2xx final response, it will automatically 
			terminate any other outstanding early dialog associated with the request. If the SIP entity receives a subsequent
			2xx final response, it will normally generate and send an ACK request, followed with a BYE request, using the 
			dialog identifier retrieved from the 2xx final response.
		</t>		
		<t>
			NOTE: A User Agent Client (UAC) can use the Request-Disposition header field <xref target="RFC3841" pageno="false" 
			format="default" /> to request that proxies do not generate and send CANCEL requests downstream once they 
			have received the first 2xx final response.
		</t>
		<t>
			When a forking proxy receives a non-2xx final response, it does not always immediately forward the response
			upstream towards the sender of the associated request. Instead, the proxy "stores" the response and waits for
			subsequent final responses from other remote destinations where the associated request was forked. At some point the proxy
			uses a specified mechanism to determine the "best" final response code, and forwards a final response using that response
			code upstream towards the sender of the associated request. When an upstream SIP entity receives the non-2xx final response
			it will release resources associated with the session. The UAC will terminate, or retry, the session setup.
		</t>				
		<t>
			Since the forking proxy does not always immediately forward non-2xx final responses, upstream SIP entities 
			(including the UAC that initiated the request) are not immediately informed that an early dialog has been terminated,
			and will therefore maintain resources associated with the early dialog reserved until a final response is sent by the
			proxy, even if the early dialog has already been terminated. A SIP entity could use the resources for other things, 
			e.g. to accept subsequent early dialogs that it otherwise would reject.
		</t>
		<t>
			This specification defines a new SIP response code, 199 Early Dialog Terminated. A forking proxy can send a 199 
			provisional response to inform upstream SIP entities that an early dialog has been terminated. A UAS can send a 199 
			response code, prior to sending a non-2xx final response, for the same purpose. SIP entities that receive the 199 response 
			can use it to trigger the release of resources associated with the terminated early dialog. In addition, SIP entities 
			might also use the 199 response to make policy related decisions related to early dialogs.

		<t>
			The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
			"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 
			<xref target="RFC2119" pageno="false" format="default"/>.
		</t>

	<section title="Applicability and Limitation" anchor="sec-app" toc="default">
		<t>
			The 199 response code is an optimization, and it only optimizes how quickly recipients might be informed about 
			terminated early dialogs. The achieved optimization is limited. Since the response is normally not sent reliably by an UAS, 
			and can not be sent reliably when generated and sent by a proxy, it is possible that some or all of the 199 responses get 
			lost before they reach the recipients. In such cases, recipients will behave the same as if the 199 response code were 
			not used at all. 
		</t>	
		<t>						
			One example for which a UAC could use the 199 response, is that when it receives a 199 response it releases resources associated 
			with the terminated early dialog. The UAC could also use the 199 response to make policy related decisions related to early 
			dialogs. For example, if a UAC is playing media associated with an early dialog, and the it receives a 199 response indicating 
			the early dialog has been terminated, it could start playing media associated with a different early dialog.
		</t> 
		<t>	
			Applications designers utilizing the 199 response code MUST ensure that the application's user experience is 
			acceptable if all 199 responses are lost, and not delivered to the recipients.
		</t>

    <section title="User Agent Client behavior" anchor="sec-client" toc="default">			
		<t>
			When a UAC sends an initial dialog initiation request, and if it is willing to receive 199 responses, it MUST insert an
			"199" option-tag in the Supported header field <xref target="RFC3261" pageno="false" format="default" /> of the request. 
			The option-tag indicates that the UAC supports, and is willing to receive, 199 responses. A UAC SHOULD NOT insert an 
			"199" option-tag in the Require or the Proxy-Require header field <xref target="RFC3261" pageno="false" format="default" />
			of the request, since in many cases it would result in unnecessary session establishment failures.
		</t>
		<t> 
            NOTE: The UAC always needs to insert an "199" option-tag in the Supported header field, in order to indicate 
			that it supports, and is willing to receive, 199 responses, even if it also inserts the option-tag in the 
			Require or Proxy-Require header field.
		</t>
		<t>
			It is RECOMMENDED that a UAC does not insert an "100rel" option-tag <xref target="RFC3262" pageno="false" 
			format="default" /> in the Require header field when it also indicates support of 199 responses, unless 
			the UAC also uses some other SIP extension or procedure that mandates it to do so. The reason is that proxies 
			are not allowed to generate and send 199 responses when the UAC has required provisional responses to be 
			sent reliably.
		</t>
		<t>
			When a UAC receives a 199 response, it might release resources associated with the terminated early 
			dialog. A UAC might also use the 199 response to make policy related decisions related to early dialogs.
		</t>
		<t>
			NOTE: The 199 response indicates that the early dialog has been terminated, so there is no need
			for the UAC to send a BYE request in order to terminate the early dialog when it receives the 199 response.
		</t>
		<t>
			NOTE: The 199 response does not affect other early dialogs associated with the session establishment. For 
			those the normal SIP rules, regarding transaction timeout etc, still apply.
		</t>
		<t>
			Once a UAC has received and accepted a 199 response, it MUST NOT send Any media associated with the early 
			dialog. In addition, if the UAC is able to associate received media with early dialogs, it MUST NOT process 
			any received media associated with the early dialog that was terminated.
		</t>
		<t>
			If multiple usages <xref target="RFC5057" pageno="false" format="default" /> are used within an early dialog,
			and it is not clear which dialog usage the 199 response terminates, SIP entities that keep dialog state SHALL NOT
			release resources associated with the early dialog when they receive the 199 response.
		</t>
		<t>
			If a UAC receives an unreliably sent 199 response on a dialog which has not previously been established 
			(this can happen if a 199 response reaches the client before the 18x response that would establish the early 
			dialog) it SHALL discard the 199 responses. If a UAC receives a reliably sent 199 response on a dialog which 
			has not previously been created, it MUST acknowledge the 199 response, as described in RFC 3262 
			<xref target="RFC3262" pageno="false" format="default" />.
		</t>
		<t>
			If a UAC has received a 199 response for all early dialogs, and no early dialog associated session establishment 
			remains, it maintains the "Proceeding" state <xref target="RFC3261" pageno="false" format="default" /> and
		    waits for possible subsequent early dialogs to be established, and eventually for a final response to be received.

    <section title="User Agent Server behavior" anchor="sec-server" toc="default">
		<t>
			If a UAS receives an initial dialog initiation request, with a Supported header field that contains a "199" 
			option-tag, it SHOULD NOT send a 199 response on an early dialog associated with the request, before it sends a
			non-2xx final response, unless it e.g. has been configured to do so due to lack of support of the 199 response code by 
			forking proxies or other intermediate SIP entities, or it is used in an environment that specifies that it shall
            send a 199 response before sending a non-2xx response.
		</t>
		<t>
			NOTE: If a UAS has created multiple early dialogs associated with an initial dialog initiation request (the UAS is acting 
			similar to a forking proxy), it does not always intend to send a final response on all of those early dialogs.
		</t>
		<t>
			NOTE: If the Require header field of an initial dialog initiation request contains a "100rel" option-tag, proxies 
			will not be able to generate and send 199 responses. In such cases the UAS might choose to send a 199 response on an 
			early dialog, before it sends a non-2xx final response, even if it would not do so in other cases.
		</t>
		<t>
			If the Supported header field of an initial dialog initiation request does not contain an "199" option-tag, 
			the UAC MUST NOT send a 199 response on any early dialog associated with the request.
		</t>
		<t>
			When a UAS generates a 199 response, the response MUST contain a To header field tag parameter <xref target="RFC3261" 
			pageno="false" format="default" />, in order for other entities to identify the early dialog that has been terminated. The UAS 
			MUST also insert a Reason header field <xref target="RFC3326" pageno="false" format="default" /> that contains a response code 
			which describes the reason why the early dialog was terminated. The UAS MUST NOT insert a "199" option-tag in the Supported, 
			Require or Proxy-Require header field of the 199 response.
		</t>
		<t>
			If a UAS intends to send 199 responses, and if it supports the procedures defined in RFC 3840 <xref target="RFC3840" pageno="false" 
			format="default" />, it MAY during the registration procedure use the sip.extensions feature tag <xref target="RFC3840" pageno="false"
			format="default" /> to indicate support of the 199 response code.
		</t>
		<t>
			A 199 response SHOULD NOT contain an SDP offer/answer message body, unless required by the
			rules in RFC 3264 <xref target="RFC3264" pageno="false" format="default" />.
		</t>
		<t>
			According to RFC 3264, if an INVITE request does not contain an SDP offer, and the 199 response is the 
			first reliably sent response associated with the request, the 199 response is required to contain an 
			SDP offer. In this case the UAS SHOULD send the 199 response unreliably, or send the 199 response reliably and
			include an SDP offer with no m- lines in the response.
		</t>
		<t>
			Since a 199 response is only used for information purpose, the UAS SHOULD send it unreliably, 
			unless the "100rel" option-tag is present in the Require header field of the associated request.
		</t>
		<t>
			Once a UAS has sent a 199 response, it MUST NOT send or process any media associated with the terminated 
			early dialog.
		</t>
    </section>
	
    <section title="Proxy behavior" anchor="sec-proxy" toc="default">
		<t>
			When a proxy receives a 199 response to an initial dialog initiation request, it MUST process the response as 
			any other non-100 provisional response. The proxy will forward the response upstream towards the sender of 
			the associated request. The proxy MAY release resources it has reserved associated with the early dialog that 
			is terminated. If a proxy receives a 199 response out of dialog, it MUST process it as other non-100 provisional
			responses received out of dialog.
		</t>
		<t>
			When a forking proxy receives a non-2xx final response to an initial dialog initiation request, that 
			it recognizes as terminating one or more early dialogs associated with the request, it MUST generate 
			and send a 199 response upstream for each of the terminated early dialogs that satisfy each of the 
			following conditions:
		</t>
		<t>
			- the forking proxy does not intend to forward the final response immediately (in accordance with rules
			for a forking proxy)
		</t>
		<t> 
			- the UAC has indicated support (by inserting the "199" option-tag in a Supported header field) of the 
			199 response code in the associated request
		</t>
		<t>
			- the UAC has not required provisional responses to be sent reliably (by inserting the "100rel" option-tag
			in a Require or Proxy-Require header field) in the associated request
		</t>
		<t>
			- the forking proxy has not already received and forwarded a 199 response for the early dialog
		</t>
		<t>
			- the forking proxy has not already sent a final response for any of the early dialogs
		</t>
		<t>
			As a consequence, once a final response to an initial dialog initiation request has been issued by
			the proxy, no further 199 responses associated with the request will be generated or forwarded by the proxy.
		</t>
		<t>
			When a forking proxy forks an initial dialog initiation request, it generates a unique Via header branch parameter value
			for each forked leg. A proxy can determine whether additional forking has occurred downstream of the
			proxy by storing the top Via branch value from each response which creates an early dialog. If the
			same top Via branch value is received for multiple early dialogs, the proxy knows that additional forking
			has occurred downstream of the proxy. A non-2xx final response received for a specific early dialog also
			terminates all other early dialog for which the same top Via branch value was received in the responses
			which created those early dialogs.
		</t>
		<t>
			Based on implementation policy, a forking proxy MAY wait before sending the 199 response, e.g. if it
			expects to receive a 2xx final response on another dialog shortly after it received the non-2xx final
			response which triggered the 199 response.
		</t>
		<t>
			When a forking proxy generates a 199 response, the response MUST contain a To header field tag parameter, that
			identifies the terminated early dialog. A proxy MUST also insert a Reason header field that contains the 
			SIP response code of the response that triggered the 199 response. The SIP response code in the Reason 
			header field informs the receiver of the 199 response about the SIP response code that was used by the UAS to 
			terminate the early dialog, and the receiver might use that information for triggering different types of 
			actions and procedures. The proxy MUST NOT insert a "199" option-tag in the Supported, Require or Proxy-Require 
			header field of the 199 response.
		</t>		
		<t>
			A forking proxy that supports generating of 199 responses MUST keep track of early dialogs, in order to
			determine whether to generate a 199 response when the proxy receives a non-2xx final response. In addition,
			a proxy MUST keep track on which early dialogs it has received and forwarded 199 responses, in order to
			not generate additional 199 responses for those early dialogs.
		</t>
		<t>
			If a forking proxy receives a reliably sent 199 response for a dialog, for which it has previously
			generated and sent a 199 response, it MUST forward the 199 response. If a proxy receives an unreliably 
			sent 199 response, for which it has previously generated and sent a 199 response, it MAY forward the 
			response, or it MAY discard it.
		</t>
		<t>
			When a forking proxy generates and sends a 199 response, the response SHOULD NOT contain a Contact 
			header field or a Record-Route header field <xref target="RFC3261" pageno="false" format="default" />.
		</t>
		<t>
			If the Require header field of an initial dialog initiation request contains an "100rel" option-tag, a 
			proxy MUST NOT generate and send 199 responses associated with that request. The reason is that
			a proxy is not allowed to generate and send 199 responses reliably.
		</t>
    </section>
	
    <section title="Backward compatibility" anchor="sec-backward" toc="default">
		<t>
			Since all SIP entities involved in a session setup do not necessarily support the specific meaning of 
			the 199 Early Dialog Terminated provisional response, the sender of the response MUST be prepared to 
			receive SIP requests and responses associated with the dialog for which the 199 response was sent 
			(a proxy can receive SIP messages from either direction). If such request is received by a UA, it 
			MUST act in the same way as if it had received the request after sending the final non-2xx response 
			to the INVITE request, as specified in RFC 3261. A UAC that receives a 199 response for an early 
			dialog MUST NOT send any further requests on that dialog, except for requests which acknowledge 
			reliable responses. A proxy MUST forward requests according to RFC 3261, even if the proxy has 
			knowledge that the early dialog has been terminated.
		</t>
		<t>
			A 199 response does not "replace" a final response. RFC 3261 specifies when a final response is 
			sent.

		</t>
		<t>
			If an INVITE request does not contain an SDP offer, and the 199 response is the first reliably 
			sent response, the 199 response is required to contain an SDP offer. In this case the UAS SHOULD

		<section title="Example with two forking proxies, of which one generates 199" toc="default">
			<t>
				The figure shows an example, where a proxy (P1) forks an INVITE request received from UAC. One 
				of the forked requests reaches UAS_2. The other requests reach another proxy (P2), that forks the 
				request to UAS_3 and UAS_4. UAS_3 and UAS_4 send 18x provisional responses in order to establish 
				early dialogs between themselves and UAC. Later UAS_3 and UAS_4 reject the INVITE request by sending 
				a 4xx error response each. P2 does not support the 199 response code, and forwards a single 4xx 
				response. P1 supports the 199 response code, and when it receives the 4xx response from P2, it also 
				manages to associate the early dialogs from both UAS_3 and UAS_4 with the response. Therefore 
				it generates and sends two 199 responses to indicate that the early dialogs from UAS_3 and UAS_4 
				have been terminated. The early dialog leg is shown in parenthesis.

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sec-security" toc="default">
		<t>
			General security issues related to SIP responses are described in RFC 3261. Due to 
			the nature of the 199 response, it may be attractive to use it for launching attacks 
			in order to terminate specific early dialogs (other early dialogs will not be affected). 
			In addition, if a man-in-the-middle generates and sends a 199 response, which terminates
			a specific dialog, towards the UAC, it can take a while until the UAS finds out that the 
			UAC, and possible stateful intermediates, have terminated the dialog. SIP security 
			mechanisms (e.g. hop-to-hop TLS) can be used to minimize, or eliminate, the risk for 
			such attacks.

    Description: This option-tag is for indicating support of the 199 
         Early Dialog Terminated provisional response code. When present 
         in a Supported header of a request, it indicates that the UAC 
         supports the 199 response code. When present in a Require or
         Proxy-Require header field of a request, it indicates that the 
         UAS, or proxies, MUST support the 199 response code. It does 
         not require the UAS, or proxies, to actually send 199 
         responses.

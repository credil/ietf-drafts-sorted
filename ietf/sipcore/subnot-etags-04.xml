    <abstract>
      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables
      receiving asynchronous notification of various events from other SIP
      user agents. This framework defines the procedures for creating,
      refreshing and terminating subscriptions, as well as fetching and
      periodic polling of resource state. These procedures provide no tools to
      avoid replaying event notifications that have already been received by a
      user agent. This memo defines an extension to SIP events that allows the
      subscriber to condition the subscription request to whether the state
      has changed since the previous notification was received. When such a
      condition is true, either the body of a resulting event notification or
      the entire notification message is suppressed.</t>

    <!-- Introduction -->

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework provides an
      extensible facility for requesting notification of certain events from
      other SIP user agents. This framework includes procedures for creating,
      refreshing and terminating of subscriptions, as well as the possibility
      to fetch or periodically poll the event resource.</t>

      <t>Several instantiations of this framework, called event packages have
      been defined, e.g., for <xref target="RFC3856">presence</xref>, <xref
      target="RFC3842">message waiting indications</xref> and <xref
      target="RFC3680">registrations</xref>.</t>

      <t>By default, every SUBSCRIBE request generates a NOTIFY request
      containing the latest event state. Typically, a SUBSCRIBE request is
      issued by the subscriber whenever it needs a subscription to be
      installed, periodically refreshed or terminated. Once the subscription
      has been installed, the majority of the NOTIFYs generated by the
      subscription refreshes are superfluous; the subscriber usually is in
      possession of the event state already, except in the unlikely case where
      a state change exactly coincides with the periodic subscription refresh.
      In most cases, the final event state generated upon terminating the
      subscription similarly contains resource state that the subscriber
      already has.</t>

      <t>Fetching or polling of resource state behaves in a similarly
      suboptimal way in cases where the state has not changed since the
      previous poll occurred. In general, the problem lies in with the
      inability to persist state across a SUBSCRIBE request.</t>

      <t>This memo defines an extension to optimize the SIP events framework.
      This extension allows a notifier to tag notifications (called
      entity-tags hereafter), and the subscriber to condition its subsequent
      SUBSCRIBE requests for actual changes since a notification carrying that
      entity-tag was issued. The solution is similar to conditional
      requests defined in the <xref target="RFC2616">Hypertext Transfer
      Protocol (HTTP)</xref>, and follows the mechanism already defined for
      the <xref target="RFC3903">PUBLISH</xref> method for issuing conditional
      event publications.</t>

      <t>This memo is structured as follows. <xref
      target="motivations"></xref> explains the background, motivations and
      requirements for the work; <xref target="operation"></xref> gives a
      general overview of the mechanism; <xref target="model"></xref> explains
      the underlying model for resources and entities as they apply to
      conditional notification; <xref target="subscriber"></xref> defines the
      subscriber behavior; <xref target="notifier"></xref> defines the
      notifier behavior; <xref target="proto"></xref> includes the protocol
      element definitions; <xref target="iana"></xref> includes the IANA
      considerations; and <xref target="security"></xref> includes the
      security considerations.</t>

        terms to describe the objects of conditional notification: <list
            style="hanging">
            <t hangText="resource"><vspace blankLines="0" />An object
            identified by a URI, whose resource state can be accessed using
            the SIP Event Notification framework. There is a single
            authoritative notifier responsible for communicating the resource
            state.</t>

            <!-- Deleted	    <t hangText="representation">
	      <vspace blankLines="0" />An event notification carries a
	      representation of the current resource state. The
	      physical realization of a representation is called an
	      entity. There may be many different representations of
	      the state of a single resource.
	    </t>-->

            <t hangText="entity"><vspace blankLines="0" />The representation
            of resource state. An entity consists of the state data carried in
            the body of a NOTIFY message, as well as related meta-data in the
            message header. There may be many versions of an entity, one
            current and the others stale. Each version of an entity is
            identified by an entity-tag, which is guaranteed to be unique
            across all versions of all entities for a resource and event
            package.</t>
          </list></t>

    <section anchor="motivations" title="Motivations and Background">
      <section anchor="overview" title="Overview">
        <t>A SUBSCRIBE request creates a subscription with a finite lifetime.
        This lifetime is negotiated using the Expires header field, and unless
        the subscription is refreshed by the subscriber before the expiration
        is met, the subscription is terminated. The frequency of these
        subscription refreshes depends on the event package, and typically
        ranges from minutes to hours.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Problem Description">
        <t>The SIP events
        framework does not include different protocol methods for initiating
        and terminating of subscriptions, subscription refreshes and fetches
        inside and outside of the SIP dialog. The SUBSCRIBE method is
        overloaded to perform all of these functions
        The difference between a fetch that does not create a
        (lasting) subscription, and a SUBSCRIBE that creates one is in the
        Expires header field value of the SUBSCRIBE; a zero-expiry SUBSCRIBE
        only generates a single NOTIFY, after which the subscription
        immediately terminates. Lasting subscriptions typically have relatively 
		short expiry periods, requiring periodic sending of new SUBSCRIBE
		requests in order to refresh the subscription.</t>
		
		<t>Each new SUBSCRIBE request generates a NOTIFY request containing the 
		latest resource state. Even if the state has not changed, it is sent again
		in response to each poll or subscription refresh. This is very similar to 
		the <xref target="RFC2616">HTTP</xref> problem of repeated GET operations
		on a resource. HTTP solves the problem using conditional requests. The server
		versions each entity with an entity tag that identifies a specific instance of
		that entity. Clients making GET requests can then include the entity tag for 
		the version of the entity that they currently to be current in an 
		"If-None-Match" header field, and the server can compare this entity tag 
		to the entity it believes to be current and 
		suppress resending the entity in the response if the server believes the
		client's version matches. In other words, the server doesn't re-send 
		information that the client has already received. </t>

        <t>The <xref target="RFC3903">SIP PUBLISH</xref> method uses
        a similar mechanism, where a refresh of a publication is done by
        reference to its assigned entity-tag, instead of retransmitting the
        event state each time the publication expiration is extended.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Requirements">
        <t>As a summary, here is the required functionality to solve the
        presented issues: <list style="format REQ%d: ">
            <t>It must be possible to suppress the NOTIFY request (or at a
            minimum the event body therein) if the subscriber is already in
            possession of (or has previously received and discarded) the latest 
			event state of the resource.</t>

            <t>This mechanism must apply to initial subscriptions, in which
            the subscriber is attempting to resume an earlier
            subscription that has been paused. </t>

            <t>This mechanism must apply to refreshing a subscription.</t>

            <t>This mechanism must apply to terminating a subscription (i.e.,
            an unsubscribe).</t>

            <t>This mechanism must apply to fetching or polling of resource
            state.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="operation" title="Overview of Operation">
      <t>Whenever a subscriber initiates a subscription, it issues a SUBSCRIBE
      request. The SUBSCRIBE request is sent, routed and processed by the
      notifier normally, i.e., according to <xref
      target="RFC3261">The Session Initiation Protocol</xref>, and <xref
      target="RFC3265">SIP Specific Event Notification</xref>.</t>

      <t>If the notifier receiving the SUBSCRIBE request supports conditional
      subscriptions, it generates an entity tag for the current entity,
      and includes it in a SIP-ETag header field of the NOTIFY
      request. The entity tag is unique across all versions of all entities
      for a resource and event package. More on this in <xref
      target="model"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Entity-tags are independent of subscriptions. This
      allows notifications generated to a fetch or a poll to have valid
      entity-tags even across subsequent fetches or polls.</t>

      <t>The subscriber will store the entity-tag received in the notification
      along with the resource state. It can then later use this entity-tag to
      make a SUBSCRIBE contain a condition in the form of a
      "Suppress-If-Match" header field. Unlike the "If-Match" condition in a
      <xref target="RFC3903">PUBLISH</xref> request, which applies to whether
      the PUBLISH succeeds or returns an error, this condition applies to the
      stream of notifications that are sent after the SUBSCRIBE request has
      been processed.</t>

      <t>The "Suppress-If-Match" header field contains the last entity-tag
      seen by the subscriber. This condition, if true, instructs the notifier
      to suppress either the body of a subsequent notification, or the entire
      notification.</t>

      <t>The condition is evaluated by matching the value of the header field
      against the entity-tag of the entity that would normally be sent in
      the associated NOTIFY message.  There is also a
      wildcard entity-tag with a special value of "*" that always matches.</t>

      <t><xref target="ov"></xref> describes a typical message flow for
      conditional notification: <list style="numbers">
          <t>The subscriber initiates a subscription by sending a SUBSCRIBE
          request for a resource.</t>

          <t>After proper authentication and authorization, the notifier
          accepts the subscription.</t>

          <t>The notifier then immediately sends the initial event
          notification, including a unique entity-tag in a SIP-ETag header
          field.</t>

          <t>The subscriber accepts the notification and stores the entity-tag
          value along with the resource state.</t>

          <t>Later, the subscriber refreshes the subscription, and includes an
          entity-tag in a Suppress-If-Match header field.</t>

          <t>The notifier evaluates the condition by matching its local
          entity-tag value for the resource against the value of the
          Suppress-If-Match header field. If the condition evaluates to true,
          the notifier informs the subscriber that the notification will not
          be sent.</t>

          <t>At some point, the state of the resource changes, e.g., the
          presence status of a user changes from online to busy. This triggers
          an event notification with a new value in the SIP-ETag header
          field.</t>

          <t>The subscriber accepts the notification and stores the new
          entity-tag along with the resource state.</t>

          <t>After a while, the subscriber decides to terminate the
          subscription. It adds a condition for Suppress-If-Match, and
          includes the entity-tag it received in the previous NOTIFY.</t>

          <t>The notifier evaluates the condition by matching its entity-tag
          for the resource against the value of the Suppress-If-Match header
          field. If the condition evaluates to true, the notifier informs the
          subscriber that no notification will be sent. This concludes the
          subscription.</t>
        </list> The benefit of using conditional notification in this example
      is in the reduction of the number of NOTIFY requests the subscriber can
      expect to receive. Each event notification that the subscriber has
      already seen is suppressed by the notifier. This example illustrates
      only one use case for the mechanism; the same principles can be used to
      optimize the flow of messages related to other event notification use
      cases.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="model" title="Resource Model for Entity-Tags">
      <t>The key to understanding how conditional notification works is
      understanding the underlying resource model of event notification. In
      general, this model is similar to the resource model of HTTP with some
      key differences. This section explains in detail the model as it applies
      to SIP events. <xref target="diagram"></xref> illustrates the model.</t>

      <t>For a given event package, there is a single authoritative agent
      responsible for zero or more resources. That is, even for a distributed
      agent, the resource state is uniform across all instances. The resource
      itself can be a <xref target="RFC4662">list of resources</xref>.
      Conditional notification for list subscriptions is addressed in <xref
      target="rls"></xref>.</t>

      <t>A resource is identified by zero or more URIs, which can be SIP URIs,
      <xref target="RFC3859">pres URIs</xref> or similar. Subscribers use this
      URI to subscribe to the resource for certain types of events, identified
      by the event package.</t>

      <t>With a successful subscription, a subscriber receives event
      notifications that communicate the resource state and the changes
      thereto. Each event notification carries a representation of the current
      resource state. This representation is influenced by many factors, e.g.,
      authorization and filtering rules, and the event composition rules of
      the notifier.</t>

      <t>This representation is realized in an "entity". Each
      resource may be associated with zero or more entities. For example, there may 
	  be multiple subscribers to the presence information of a single user (a resource),
	  and each subscriber may have a different filtered view of that resource, 
	  producing one entity per subscriber. However, each entity is associated with 
	  one and only one resource; there is no "compositing" of resources at the entity level. 
	  Resources may themselves be made up of information from other resources (be
	  "composite resources"), but this does not change the one-resource-per-entity rule.</t>
	  

      <t>An entity consists of the data carried in the body of a NOTIFY
      message, and related meta-data in the message header. Whenever the data in 
	  the body or any of the meta-data changes, the notifier MUST produce a 
	  new entity-tag. This meta-data MUST
      include, but is not limited to the following SIP header fields defined in <xref
      target="RFC3261">The Session Initiation Protocol</xref> and <xref
      target="RFC3265">SIP Specific Event Notification</xref>:

        <list style="numbers">
		  <t>Content-Disposition</t>
          <t>Content-Encoding</t>
          <t>Content-Language</t>
          <t>Content-Length</t>       
          <t>Content-Type</t>
          <t>Event</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>Note that the Subscription-State is explicitly not part of the
      entity. Event packages may in the future define additional fields that
      implementations need to consider as part of the entity.</t>

      <t>An entity has one or more versions of which only one is current and
      all others stale. Each version has an entity-tag, which uniquely
      identifies it across all versions of all entities pertaining to a single
      resource and event package.</t>

      <t>Note that two entity-tags for different resources being equal does not 
	  indicate identical
      entities. In other words, if an entity-tag received for a subscription to 
	  a first resource  matches an entity-tag received for a subscription to a 
	  second resource, the subscriber cannot assume that the two entity values 
	  are equal.</t>

      <t>With partial event notification, the NOTIFY message only carries the
      delta state, or the set of changes to the previous version of the
      entity. In that case, implementations MUST consider the full event state
      as the version of the entity to which the entity-tag in the NOTIFY
      message applies.</t>

      <t>The conditional notification mechanism is independent of the way in
      which subscriptions are installed. In other words, the mechanism
      supports implicit subscriptions, such as those associated with the <xref
      target="RFC3515">REFER method</xref>.</t>

      <t>It is possible that the same resource is in some shape or form
      accessible through another mechanism in addition to SIP Event
      Notification, e.g., HTTP or the SIP PUBLISH method. In general,
      implementations MUST NOT expect the entity-tags to be shared between the
      mechanisms, unless event packages or specific applications of SIP Events
      explicitly define such dependencies.</t>

    <section anchor="subscriber" title="Subscriber Behavior">
      <t>This section augments the subscriber behavior defined in <xref
      target="RFC3265">RFC3265</xref>. It first discusses general issues
      related to <xref target="subs_support">indicating support for the
      mechanism</xref> and <xref target="subs_gen">creating conditions in
      SUBSCRIBE requests</xref>; it then describes the workflows for the main
      three use cases for making the subscription conditional.</t>

      <section anchor="subs_support"
               title="Detecting Support for Conditional Notification">
        <t>The mechanism defined in this memo is backwards compatible with
        <xref target="RFC3265">SIP events</xref> in that a notifier supporting
        this mechanism will insert a SIP entity-tag in its NOTIFY requests,
        and a subscriber that understands this mechanism will know how to use
        it in creating a conditional request.</t>

        <t>Unaware subscribers will simply ignore the entity-tag, make
        requests without conditions and receive the default treatment from the
        notifier. Unaware notifiers will simply ignore the conditional header
        fields, and continue normal operation.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="subs_gen" title="Generating SUBSCRIBE Requests">
        <t>When creating a conditional SUBSCRIBE request, the subscriber MUST
        include a single conditional header field including an entity-tag in
        the request. The condition is evaluated by comparing the entity-tag of
        the subscribed resource with the entity-tag carried in the conditional
        header field. If they match, the condition evaluates to true.</t>

        <t>Unlike the condition introduced for the <xref target="RFC3903">SIP
        PUBLISH</xref> method, these conditions do not apply to the SUBSCRIBE
        request itself, but to the resulting NOTIFY requests. When true, the
        condition drives the notifier to change its behavior with regards to
        sending the notifications after the SUBSCRIBE.</t>

        <t>This specification defines a new header field called
        "Suppress-If-Match". This header field introduces a condition to the
        SUBSCRIBE request. If true, it instructs the notifier to either omit
        the body of the resulting NOTIFY message (if the SUBSCRIBE is not sent
        within an existing dialog), or suppress (i.e., block) the NOTIFY
        request that would otherwise be triggered the SUBSCRIBE (for an
        established dialog). In the latter case, the SUBSCRIBE message will be
        answered with a 204 (No Notification) response. As long as the
        condition remains true, it also instructs the notifier to either
        suppress any subsequent NOTIFY request, or if there are reportable
        changes in the NOTIFY header, e.g., the Subscription-State has
        changed, suppress the body of any subsequent NOTIFY request.</t>

        <t>If the condition is false, the notifier follows its default
        behaviour.</t>

        <t>If the subscriber receives a 204 (No Notification) to an in-dialog
        SUBSCRIBE, the subscriber can clear handle that it may have had
        pending on a NOTIFY in response the SUBSCRIBE message.</t>

        <t>The value of the "Suppress-If-Match" header field is an entity-tag,
        which is an opaque token that the subscriber simply copies (bytewise) 
		from a previously received NOTIFY request. Inclusion of an entity-tag 
		in a "Suppress-If-Match" header field of a SUBSCRIBE request indicates 
		that the client either has a copy of, or is capable of re-creating a 
		copy of, the entity associated with that entity-tag.</t>

        <t>Example: <list style="empty">
            <t>Suppress-If-Match: b4cf7</t>
          </list></t>
<t> </t>

        <t>The header field can also be wildcarded using the special "*"
        entity-tag value. Such a condition always evaluates to true regardless
        of the value of the current entity-tag for the resource.</t>

        <t>Example: <list style="empty">
            <t>Suppress-If-Match: *</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Such a wildcard condition effectively quenches a subscription; the
        only notifications received are those reporting changes to the
        subscription state and those in response to a SUBSCRIBE message sent
        outside of an existing dialog. In both cases, the notifications will
        not contain a body. <list style="empty">
            <t>A subscription with a wildcard "Suppress-If-Match" condition is
            useful in scenarios where the subscriber wants to temporarily put
            a subscription in dormant mode. For example, a host may want to
            conserve bandwidth and power when it detects from screen or input
            device inactivity that the user isn't actively monitoring the
            presence statuses of contacts.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Receiving NOTIFY Requests">
        <t>When a subscriber receives a NOTIFY request that contains a
        SIP-ETag header field, it MUST store the entity-tag if it wishes to
        make use of the conditional notification mechanism. The subscriber
        MUST be prepared to receive a NOTIFY with any entity-tag value,
        including a value that matches any previous value that the subscriber
        might have seen.</t>

        <t>The subscriber MUST NOT infer any meaning from the value of an
        entity-tag; specifically, the subscriber MUST NOT assume identical
        entities (i.e., event state) for NOTIFYs with identical entity-tag
        values when those NOTIFYs result from subscription to different 
		resources.
		  <list style="empty">
              <t>Note that there are valid cases for which identical entity-tag
              values on different resources may occur. For example, it is  
              possible to generate entity-tag values using a one-way hash
              function, resulting in the possibility that two different resources 
			  having the same entity-value will also have the same entity tag. 
			  Clients however MUST NOT assume that this is the case, as the algorithm 
			  for the generation of entity tags is notifier-dependent and not 
			  negotiated with the subscriber. Consequently, the subscriber cannot 
			  differentiate between two entity tags that have the same value because 
			  they are similar hashes of identical entities, or because two notifiers
			  happen to have used the same sequential number as an entity tag. Entity 
			  tags are only required to be unique for a given resource, not globally
			  unique.</t>

      <section anchor="generating" title="Generating Entity-tags">

        <t>An entity-tag is a token carried in the SIP-ETag header field, and
        it is opaque to the client. The notifier is free to decide on any
        means for generating the entity-tag. It can have any value, except for
        "*". For example, one possible method is to implement the entity-tag
        as a simple counter, incrementing it by one for each generated
        notification per resource.</t>

        <t>A notifier MUST generate entity-tags for event notifications of all
        resources it is responsible for. The entity-tag MUST be unique across
        all versions of all entities for each state of a resource as reported 
		by a given event package. Otherwise said, for any subscription or 
		sequence of subscriptions to a specific resource using a singular event 
		package, each entity tag produced MUST map to one and only one 
		presentation of resource state (entity). Two identical entities for 
		a specific resource might or might not have identical entity tags; this
		decision is left to the notifier.</t>

        <t>An entity-tag is considered valid for as long as the entity
        exits. An entity becomes stale when its version is no longer the
        current one. The notifier MUST remember (or be able to recalculate)
		the entity-tag of an entity as long as the version of the entity 
		is current. The notifier MAY
        remember the entity-tag longer than this, e.g., for implementing <xref

        <t>The entity tag values used in publications are not necessarily
        shared with the entity tag values used in subscriptions. This is
        because there may not always be a one-to-one mapping between a
        publication and a notification of state change; there may be several 
		sources to the
        event composition process, and a publication into a resource may 
		not affect the resulting entity.</t>

        <t>When a condition in a SUBSCRIBE request for suppressing
        notifications is true (i.e., the local entity-tag for the resource
        state and the entity-tag in a Suppress-If-Match header field 
		are byte-wise identical)
        but there are reportable changes in the NOTIFY header (e.g., the
        Subscription-State has changed), the notifier MUST suppress the body
        of the NOTIFY request. That is, the resulting NOTIFY contains no
        Content-Type header field, the Content-Length is set to zero, and no
        payload is attached to the message.</t>

        <t>Additionally, when a condition in a SUBSCRIBE request for
        suppressing notifications is true and the SUBSCRIBE message is not
        sent within an established dialog, the notifier MUST send a NOTIFY
        request with a suppressed entity body.</t>

        <t>Suppressing the entity body of a NOTIFY does not change the current
        entity-tag of the resource. Hence, the NOTIFY MUST contain a SIP-Etag
        header field that contains the unchanged entity-tag of the resource
        state.</t>

        in a Suppress-If-Match header field match), and the SUBSCRIBE is sent
        within an established dialog, then the notifier MUST suppress the
        resulting NOTIFY request, and generate a 204 (No Notification)
        response. As long as the condition remains true, and there are no
        reportable changes in the NOTIFY header, all subsequent NOTIFY
        requests MUST also be suppressed.</t>

        <t>Further extensions could define means for notifiers to keep track of
        the state changes of a resource, e.g., storing the changes in a journal. 
		If a condition fails, the notifier would then send a state differential 
		in the NOTIFY rather
        than the full state of the event resource. This is only possible if
        the event package and the subscriber both support a payload format
        that has this capability.</t>

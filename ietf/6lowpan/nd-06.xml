	  <t>
	  This document specifies Neighbor Discovery optimized for 6LoWPAN.
	  The 6LoWPAN format allows IPv6 to be used over energy and bandwidth
	  constrained wireless networks often making use of multihop
	  topologies. However, the use of standard IPv6 Neighbor Discovery with
	  6LoWPAN has several problems. Standard Neighbor Discovery was not designed
	  for non-transitive wireless links, and the standard IPv6 link concept and
	  heavy use of multicast makes it unpractical. This document specifies a new ND mechanism allowing for the efficient detection of duplicate addresses over entire LoWPANs, which also optimizes other ND operations. In addition, context dissemination, claim and defend address generation, and the support of Extended LoWPANs over Backbone Links are specified.

	<section anchor='introduction' title="Introduction">

	  <t>The IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4 <xref target="RFC4944"/> document has specified
	  how to carry IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4 and similar networks with the
  	  help of an adaptation header which comes before the IP header.
	  A link in 6LoWPAN is characterized as lossy, low-power, low bit-rate, short
	  range, with many nodes saving energy with long deep sleep periods. Multicast as used in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery <xref target="RFC4861"/> is not desirable in
	  such a wireless low-power, lossy network. </t>

	  <t>Moreover, LoWPAN links are non-symmetric and transient in nature; they are
	  not always considered to be in a fixed network nor are they bounded by
	  our standard definition of a wired-link. A LoWPAN is potentially composed of a potentially large amount of overlapping radio ranges, eventually federated by a backbone or a backhaul link. Although a given radio range
	  has broadcast capabilities, the aggregation of these is a complex Non-Broadcast
	  MultiAccess (NBMA, <xref target="RFC2491"/>) structure with no multicast
	  capabilities. Link-local scope is in reality defined by
	  reachability and radio strength. The standard IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
	  <xref target="RFC4861"/> control messages, the use of multicast and their
	  default frequency also attribute to unnecessary waste of energy in LoWPANs.</t>

	  <t>6LoWPAN Neighbor discovery provides for basic bootstrapping and network
	  operation, along with advanced features such as claim and defend address generation and
	  Extended LoWPANs over backbone links, while avoiding the use of multicast flooding.
	  The solution supports the use of both link-layer or LoWPAN mesh (Mesh Under) and IP routing (Route Over) multihop solutions. Unlike standard IPv6 ND <xref target="RFC4861"/>, this document specifically takes the characteristics of low-power, lossy wireless links into account.</t>

	  <t>This specification introduces a registration mechanism over
	  the radio edge of the NBMA network and proxy operation over the federating
	  backbone or backhaul. That registration mechanism provides a service
	  somewhat similar to the Multicast Address Resolution Server (MARS) <xref target="RFC2022"/> for a limited purpose, and in a lot simpler and less generic fashion. For those link scope
	  multicasts that could not be avoided, such as for Router Advertisements, optimizations may be used to optimize the dissemination of the information in the Low Power network.</t>

	  <t>The concept of a LoWPAN Whiteboard located at Edge Routers (ERs) is introduced,
	  which allows for Duplicate Address Detection and claim and defend addressing for the entire LoWPAN. Address resolution is not required, and thus makes LoWPAN
	  operation power efficient and to reduces LoWPAN Node complexity. A new
	  registration/confirmation message sequence is specified, allowing nodes to
	  register their IPv6 addresses with an Edge Router. </t>

	  <t> The Whiteboard makes use of soft bindings, thus nodes send periodic registration messages in order to maintain their bindings. Changes in network topology, and mobility between ERs and LoWPANs are supported. The dissemination of RA information between LoWPAN Routers in multihop IP LoWPANs is also discussed.</t>

	  <t>This document also specifies the seamless integration of an Extended LoWPAN with
	  multiple edge routers on a shared backbone link (e.g. Ethernet) to form a
	  single IPv6 subnet. This allows nodes to keep the same IPv6 address throughout
	  a large network, and allows for easy communications with nodes over the backbone link and with other IPv6 hosts.
	  </t>

	  <t>The document defines two new ICMPv6 messages: Node Registration and Node Confirmation. In addition a new 6LOWPAN_ER anycast address is introduced, used by LoWPAN Routers in order to relay a registration message to any Edge Router.</t>

	  <section anchor='goalsnassumptions' title="Goals &amp; Assumptions">

	  <t>This document has the following main goals and makes several assumptions.</t>

	  <t>Goals:
	    <list style="symbols">
	    	 <t>Enable ND operations over an entire LoWPAN, even with
	    	 non-transitive links and over multihop IP hops.</t>
	  	 <t>Minimize signalling by avoiding the use of multicast flooding and reducing the frequency of link scope multicast for ND messages inside the LoWPANs.</t>
	  	 <t>Disseminate context information throughout the LoWPAN.</t>
	  	 <t>Minimize the complexity of LoWPAN Nodes.</t>
	  	 <t>Interconnect LoWPANs with backbone links seamlessly.</t>
	  	 <t>Provide a mechanism for claim and defend addressing.</t>
	    </list>
	  </t>

	  <t>Assumptions:
	    <list style="symbols">
		 <t>Link layer technology may be e.g. IEEE 802.15.4 as in <xref target="RFC4944"/>, or any other suitable link-layer.</t>
	    	 <t>Link-local IPv6 addresses are derived from a unique identifier (e.g. EUI-64).</t>
	    	 <t>There is typically a direct mapping between the IPv6 address IID and the link-layer address (this is already an assumption by <xref target="RFC4944"/> used for header compression), thus address resolution is not normally required.</t>
	  	 <t>A subnet includes all the LoWPAN Nodes, Edge Router(s) and optionally their backbone link sharing the same IPv6 prefix.</t>
	    </list>
	  </t>

        </section>

	  <section anchor='why_not' title="Why not standard IPv6 ND?">

	  <t>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery <xref target="RFC4861"/> provides several
	  important functions such as Router Discovery, Address Resolution, Duplicate
	  Address Detection, Redirect, Prefix and Parameter Discovery.</t>

    	  <t>Following power-on and initialization of the network in IPv6 Ethernet
    	  networks, a node joins the solicited-node multicast address on the interface
    	  and then performs duplicate address detection (DAD) for the acquired
    	  link-local address by sending a solicited-node multicast message to the link.
    	  After that it sends multicast messages to the all-router address to solicit
    	  router advertisements. Once the host receives a valid router advertisement
    	  with the "A" flag, it autoconfigures the IPv6 address with the advertised
    	  prefix in the router advertisement (RA). Besides this, the IPv6 routers
    	  usually send router advertisements periodically on the network. RAs are sent to the all-node multicast address. Nodes send Neighbor Solicitation/Neighbor
    	  Advertisement messages to resolve the IPv6 address of the destination
    	  on the link. These NS/NA messages are also often multicast messages and
    	  it is assumed that the node is on the same link and relies on the fact
    	  that the destination node is always powered and generally reliable.</t>

	  <t>A LoWPAN network typically uses two types of L2 addresses - for example 16-bit
	  short addresses and 64-bit unique addresses as defined in <xref target="RFC4944"/>.
	  Moreover, the available L2 payload size on the order of less than 100 bytes
	  where we often
	  might need to use header compression and use a minimum payload. The network
	  is lossy and low-powered, and it does not provide multicast capability at
	  the link-layer, thus simulating multicast behavior by both using broadcast
	  or sending a number of unicast messages, both expensive for the low-powered
	  network and the low-processing capable nodes. Often these low-powered
	  nodes conserve energy by using sleep schedules; waking them up to receive IPv6
	  signaling messages such as multicast messages for NS or periodic RAs is not
	  practical. Also they are not capable of processing address-resolution for their
	  neighbors effectively. Due to the radio strength of its neighboring
	  router or its own strength, a node may often move from one router to
	  another without physically moving from one place to another. Considering
	  the above characteristics in a LoWPAN, and the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery <xref target="RFC4861"/> base protocol requirements, it was concluded that
	  standard Neighbor Discovery is not suitable as it is and a 6LoWPAN-specific
	  ND definition would be useful and efficient for the wide deployment of IPv6
	  over low-powered wireless networks of embedded devices.</t>

	   <t>
	      6LoWPAN Neighbor discovery (6LoWPAN-ND) provides additions and optimizations to IPv6 ND <xref target="RFC4861"/> specifically supporting 6LoWPAN. Basic Neighbor Discovery mechanisms are optimized, avoiding the use of multicast flooding and minimizing link-local multicast (broadcast) frequency. The detection of duplicate addresses is performed across the entire LoWPAN. This is achieved using a Whiteboard located on the Edge Routers of the LoWPAN network. An Extended LoWPAN topology over a shared backbone link is optionally supported.
	   </t>

	   <t>
	      The following list summarizes 6LoWPAN-ND operations and the differences with <xref target="RFC4861"/>:

		  <list style="hanging">
			<t hangText="Router Discovery:">As in <xref target="RFC4861"/> with the addition of new 6LoWPAN specific options to Router Advertisements.</t>

			<t hangText="Prefix Discovery:">The discovery of 6LoWPAN prefixes with context identifiers. Destinations are assumed to be non-local unless explicitly known to be a neighbor.</t>

			<t hangText="Address Autoconfiguration:">Stateless address autoconfiguration is supported as in <xref target="RFC4861"/>. Additionally a claim and defend address generation method is supported using the Whiteboard.</t>

			<t hangText="Address Resolution:">Not typically performed, as IIDs are normally formed from link-layer addresses. Mechanism is however included enabling routers to perform address resolution for local destinations. </t>

	      This specification makes use of RS/RA message exchanges along with standard NS/NA on the  Backbone Link. The use of NS/NA message exchanges in the LoWPAN are not required by this document. In addition 6LoWPAN-ND defines two new ICMP packet types:

	   <t>
	      ND for 6LoWPAN is designed to work with a wide variety of 6LoWPAN topologies, including isolated Ad-hoc LoWPANs, Simple LoWPANs and Extended LoWPANs. A Simple LoWPAN topology is assumed by default in the text. The case of Ad-hoc LoWPAN operation is described in <xref target="adhoc"/>. Edge Router operation and Extended LoWPAN functionality are described in <xref target="eroperation"/>. Edge Routers which will operate only in Simple LoWPANs do not need to support Extended LoWPAN functionality, such as Edge Routers which do not have a Backbone Link (but instead e.g. an ADSL interface).
	   </t>

	   </section>

	   <section anchor='overviewlink' title="Links">

	   <t>
	      The use of IEEE 802.15.4 or any other similar link-layer technology which exhibits the characteristics defined for a 6LoWPAN link such as low data-rates,
	      packet loss, limited range, asymmetricity and long sleep-cycles. This specification is able to deal with the non-symmetric, non-transitive nature of these links.
	   </t>
	   <t>
	      6LoWPAN-ND is agnostic to the use of link-layer mesh or <xref target="RFC4944"/> mesh techniques, which alleviate the otherwise non-transitive nature of wireless links. This so-called Mesh Under topology thus makes the entire link to appear to the IP layer as having a link-local scope covering all the 6LoWPAN interfaces in the LoWPAN. This kind of LoWPAN is made up of hosts and Edge Routers. This link still exhibits lossy, low-rate, asymmetric behavior along with sleep cycles.
	   </t>
	   <t>
	      The non-transitive nature of the link can also be overcome using IP routing within the LoWPAN, also called a Route Over topology. LoWPAN Routers are used in the LoWPAN to provide routing between all nodes in the LoWPAN. LoWPAN Router operations are specified in <xref target="roperation"/>. Link-local scope includes the neighbors of each node within symmetric wireless range. Mesh Under and Route Over techniques are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible to combine IP routing and mesh link-layers within a LoWPAN.
	   </t>

	   </section>

	   <section anchor='overviewbs' title="Bootstrapping">

	   <t>
	   	1. A Host first performs stateless address autoconfiguration of its link-local unicast address for each LoWPAN interface from its EUI-64 as in <xref target="RFC4944"/>. When a LoWPAN Node wants to join a LoWPAN, it does so by listening for Route Advertisements from Edge Routers or LoWPAN Routers, or by broadcasting a Router Solicitation (RS) and receiving RA responses from local routers (see <xref target="figmessrsra"/>). If a valid prefix is advertised in the RA, the host will also form an optimistic global unique address with stateless address autoconfiguration (or any other suitable method). At this point the node has also chosen one or more default routers.
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   	2. Next the node will attempt to perform initial registration with an Edge Router. Registration is always performed with a link-local
	   	Edge Router or router by sending a unicast Node Registration (NR) message to it. Registering directly with an Edge Router is of course preferred as shown in  <xref target="figmessbasic"/> (the ER is differentiated by the Prf flag in its RA), although all LoWPAN Routers have the ability to relay NR/NC messages on behalf of a node as shown in <xref target="figmessrelay"/>.
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   	These message exchanges are illustrated below. The NR contains the addresses the node wants to register.  A node may request a short address to be generated on its behalf by including an Address Option with the A flag and an address of length 0 in the NR.
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   	3. The Edge Router replies either directly with a Node Confirmation (NC), or through the relaying router. Note that routers only exist in Route Over configurations, and in pure Mesh Under configurations nodes are always within link-local scope of an Edge Router. This NC includes the set of addresses now confirmed to be bound to the Whiteboard of the ER. The Host is now capable of using the LoWPAN fully, and the ER forwards on its behalf.

         	The node may now send packets to any IPv6 address inside or outside the LoWPAN. Destinations are assumed to be non-local unless known to be within link-local scope (valid entry in the neighbor cache). Address resolution is not required to be performed with neighbors as in <xref target="RFC4861"/>, but instead the IID part of the IPv6 address directly corresponds to a MAC address. NS/NA messages are not used.
         </t>
	   <t>
	   	The Whiteboard address bindings and assignments are soft, and thus must
	   	be renewed periodically as indicated by the lifetime of the binding.
	   	This is achieved by periodically sending a new NR to the ER. If a
	   	host moves, or the network topology changes, and the current ER is
	   	no longer available, the host then starts the registration process
	   	with another ER. If the host is still in the same Extended LoWPAN (same subnet prefix), its IPv6 addresses remain the same. Claim and defend addresses generated by the Whiteboard must be remembered by the host and refreshed in order to keep the address. If the host moves to a different LoWPAN (thus with a different subnet prefix), the bootstrapping process is initiated again. See <xref target="sdoperation"/> for details on node operation.
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   	LoWPAN Routers periodically send RAs to their neighbors. The Edge Router initiates the first RAs, and this information is included in the RAs of each router. RA periods can be optimized to reduce signalling. See <xref target="roperation"/> for detailed router operation.

		<section anchor='overviewof' title="Optional features">

	   <t>
	   	This documents specifies a method for forming Extended LoWPAN networks with multiple ERs on a backbone link. This optional Edge Router feature allows for the detection of duplicate addresses across the entire Extended LoWPAN and backbone links, seen as a single subnet. The method uniquely identifies the LoWPAN Host on the backbone, and overrides the claim on an address on behalf of a LoWPAN Host. Thus a Host can keep the same address, and appears the same to other hosts on the backbone link, regardless of moving its binding from one ER to another. See <xref target="eroperation"/> for a description of Extended LoWPAN operation. Extended LoWPAN operation does not require changes to node operation.

	   <section anchor='bumess' title="Node Registration/Confirmation Message">

	     <t>
	       The Node Registration (NR) and Node Confirmation
	       (NC) messages are used by a node to register with an
	       ER, and for the ER to confirm the binding. The NR is also 
	       used to refresh its registration with a local router at a faster
	       interval.
	       Any option that is not recognized MUST be skipped silently. The
	       Node Registration message is sent by the LoWPAN Node
	       to the link-local unicast IPv6 address of an local Edge Router
	       or LoWPAN Router. NR/NC messages may be sent over multiple
	       IP hops within the LoWPAN by relaying routers, thus received messages with a
	       hop limit less than 255 MUST be accepted by LoWPAN Routers from senders with
	       a source address in the same LoWPAN. Relaying routers may also use
	       the 6LOWPAN_ER anycast address as the destination.
	     </t>
	     <t>
	       When registering the first time (the node still has optimistic addresses) it
	       sends an NR message to the link-local unicast address of an local
	       ER or LoWPAN Router. The source address must be the IPv6 unspecified address
	       to comply with oDAD.
	     </t>
	     <t>
	       Nodes send subsequent NR messages to a local ER or router, however the IPv6 source address is then the link-local IPv6 address of the sender. NR local refresh messages SHOULD be sent more often 
	       to a local router, thus reducing the amount of traffic sent to ERs over multiple hops. The timings of registrations and local refresh messages are indicated by the Binding Lifetime and Advertising
	       Interval fields, respectively.
		</t>
		<t>
	       This same message format is also used for relayed
	       NR/NC messages, with an alternative code that is set
	       when the message has been relayed. When relaying, a new
	       message is created with an updated checksum, and a code is
	       used to indicate relaying. The hop limit is not decremented
	       when relaying.
	     </t>
	     <t>
	     	 Address Options are included in the NR message for each IPv6 address to be 
	     	 registered, and included in the corresponding NC to indicate success. When 
	     	 NR/NC messages are sent through a relaying router Target link-layer and 
	     	 Source link-layer address options are used to indicate the ER with which 
	     	 registration occured (in an NC) or which ER should preferably be used 
	     	 (in an NR).  
	     </t>

	       NS/NA messages are also employed between ERs on the backbone link.
	       For this use a unique identifier is required in
	       the message as an option to uniquely identify a
	       host's interface. The standard NS/NA message is used in this
	       document is as per <xref target="RFC4861"/> with the
	       an additional Owner Interface Identifier Option defined in this document.
	       The Owner Interface Identifier is the same as that carried in NR/NC messages
	       and associated with bindings.
	     </t>

	     <t>
	       If NS/NA messages are sent on the LoWPAN link (which is not required by this specification), they do not carry link-layer address options, because of link non-transitivity and the Extended LoWPAN topologies do not preserve the MAC address. For the same reason redirect is not supported. Instead they MUST include the Owner Interface Identifier option to help resolve conflict.

	       a message. In order to be as compact as possible, fields are used to indicate
	       the compression of the IPv6 address. The Address Option also allows
	       for duplicate addresses (e.g. anycasts), the request of a generated address for claim and defend, or for an address to be removed.

                 the LoWPAN.  New context information SHOULD be
                 introduced into the LoWPAN with C=1 and V=0, to
                 ensure it is known by all nodes that may have to
                 decompress based on this context information.  Only
                 when it is reasonable to assume that this information was
                 successfully disseminated SHOULD an option with C=1

                 recently changed context, old values of a context
                 SHOULD be taken out of use for a while before new

                 its dissemination SHOULD continue for at least MIN_CONTEXT_CHANGE_DELAY with

                 that the fact that the context is now invalid was
                 successfully disseminated, should the context ID be
                 taken out of dissemination or reused with a different
                 Information field.  In the latter case, dissemination of

	   <t>
	   This section specifies LoWPAN node operations, and explains the differences to <xref target="RFC4861"/> node operation, while specifying the new Node Registration operation. Instead of relying on multicast ND messages for DAD and neighbor unreachability detection, LoWPAN Nodes send unicast messages to an Edge Router in the LoWPAN
	   which keeps a Whiteboard of all bound addresses from nodes attached
	   to that ER. Thus these functions are performed across the entire LoWPAN using the Whiteboard, which allows 6LoWPAN-ND to operate over asymmetric, non-transitive links and with sleeping nodes. Node complexity and energy consumption are reduced as address resolution and the support of redirect are not required, ND traffic is
	   reduced and nodes do not exchange NS/NA messages. In an Extended LoWPAN topology, ND functions are performed across the entire Extended LoWPAN, and a node may change its point of attachment within the LoWPAN without changing its IPv6 addresses. Extended LoWPAN operation is transparent for nodes.

	<section anchor='sdoperationfa' title="Interface initialization">

	   <t>
	   All nodes are required to autoconfigure at least one address, a link-local
	   address, which is derived from the IEEE 64-bit extended MAC
	   address that is globally unique to the interface as in <xref target="RFC4944"/>.
         As a result, knowledge of the 64-bit address of another LoWPAN Node is enough
         to derive its link-local address and reach it if on the same link. Another
         consequence is that the link-local address is presumably unique on the Extended LoWPAN, which enables the use of Optimistic Duplicate Address Detection (oDAD) <xref target="RFC4429"/> over the backbone link and the LoWPAN. The address SHOULD be created as optimistic before it has been confirmed by an Edge Router.
	   Due to the way 6LoWPAN networks perform address compression <xref target="RFC4944"/> nodes within a LoWPAN use addresses in a homogeneous way and the unicast IPv6 address IID resolves directly to a corresponding link-layer address. As a result, address resolution within the LoWPAN is not normally required. 
	   </t>

	   <t>
	   A node MUST join the all-nodes multicast address, which is used for receiving
	   RAs from routers. A node MAY join other multicast addresses such as the solicited-node multicast address if its link-layer includes multicast support, but that is not required by this specification.
	   </t>

	   <t>
	   Nodes MAY learn the address of Edge Routers or routers using
	   traditional means such as L2 configuration or Router Advertisement
	   messages as in <xref target="RFC4861"/>. When sending a Router Solicitation it MUST not have the SLLA Option, but instead MUST include the OII Option. If the sender of the RS has only optimistic addresses, it MUST not use them as the IPv6 source address for the RS, but instead uses the IPv6 unspecified address. This procedure is to comply with the use of optimistic addresses as per oDAD <xref target="RFC4429"/>.
	   </t>

   	   <t>
	   The node SHOULD also form a global unicast address for
	   routing inside the LoWPAN and reachability from outside the LoWPAN.
	   If a valid prefix is available from an RA ('A' flag is set), then a global unicast
	   address MAY be derived using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration <xref target="RFC4862"/>. This address is marked optimistic until confirmed by the ER. If the LoWPAN is operating in ad-hoc mode, then the prefix is a Unique Local IPv6 Address (ULA) prefix <xref target="RFC4193"/> as specified in <xref target="adhoc" /> (use of a ULA prefix requires no changes to node operation). A node MAY alternatively aquire a global unicast address using other suitable means, e.g. DHCPv6, L2 assignment or manual configuration.
	   </t>


      </section>

	<section anchor='sdoperationbind' title="Registration process">

	   <t>
	   The binding process is very similar to that of a MIPv6 mobile node, though
	   the messages used are new Neighbor Discovery ICMP messages. A LoWPAN Node
	   address is tentative or optimistic as long as the binding is not confirmed by the ER. There are two kinds of Node Registrations. Requests NRs (Code = 0) are used for initial registration with an ER, ans subsequent ER binding updates. Requests are sent infrequently to minimize overhead (as they may be sent over multiple hops). Refresh NRs (Code = 3) are only sent to the local LoWPAN Router in order to refresh its binding table. Refresh messages are sent more often than Request messages. If an ER is local, then refresh messages are not sent.  
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   The LoWPAN Node uses unicast Node Registrations with local ERs or LoWPAN Routers to perform the binding. The destination address is the link-local unicast address of an local ER or LoWPAN Router. While a nodes addresses are still optimistic (first registration in a LoWPAN), the IPv6 unspecified address must be used as the source. Registration SHOULD be preferred with local ERs rather than LoWPAN Routers if available. The Preference Flag of the RA is used to differentiate between ERs (Prf=01) and LoWPAN Routers (Prf=00). LoWPAN Routers with Prf=11 SHOULD NOT be used for registration. Furthermore the ER Metric in the 6LoWPAN Summary Option SHOULD be used to choose a router to use for registration. 
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   When performing Node Registration through a LoWPAN Router, the actual ER is transparent to the 
	   node by default (the router chooses the best ER). In order to provide nodes the possibility to control which ER they register with, Target link-layer and Source link-layer address options are used with NR/NC messages. LoWPAN Routers include a Source link-layer address option when relaying an NC to a node, this indicates the IID of the ER. When sending an NR to a LoWPAN Router, a node may choose to include a Target link-layer address option with the IID of the ER the node wants to register with. The router then attempts to make use of that ER if available.
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   A unique Owner Interface Identifier (OII) is included in the Node Registration so the binding can be identified throughout the LoWPAN. The OII SHOULD be formed from the EUI-64 of the interface in the same way as the node's link-local address IID as defined in <xref target="RFC4944"/>. A randomly generated 32-bit Owner Nonce is formed each time a node boots or reboots. This is included in the NR and is used by ERs to detect duplicate OIIs. While cryptographic randomness <xref target="RFC4086"/> is not strictly required, the randomness SHOULD be derived using a mechanism of similar quality.
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   The NR message includes an Address Option for each address to be registered. Thus the message is structured as follows:
	   </t>

	   <t>ICMPv6 (Node Registration (Address Option[0], Address Option[1], Address Option[n]))</t>

   	   <t>
	   This registration method includes a way of requesting a unique address from the ER by setting the 'A' flag in an Address Option during registration. This is useful for receiving a unique short link-layer address, and works in a claim and defend fashion. Although the address is generated by the ER and checked for uniqueness across the LoWPAN, it is just like any other address binding in the whiteboard of the ER after assignment. Thus in order to keep using this address the host must keep refreshing the address binding, including when moving to another ER in the same LoWPAN.
	   </t>

	   <t>A unique Transaction ID (TID) is included by the host in the NR message and
	   used to match replies. A lollipop mechanism is used. TID is set to 0 upon booting,
	   and is incremented with each Request NR message. The TID MUST NOT be incremented when sending a Refresh NR message. After reaching 0xFF, the value loops to
	   16 (0x10) and is incremented from there. Thus the values between 0-15 MUST only used after a boot or reboot while not yet registered with an ER. A node that has not heard a valid Node Confirmation for 16 Node Registration messages in a row restarts with a local next TID of zero (the node MAY, but need not, generate a new Owner Nonce). </t>

	   <t>
	   The acknowledgment to a Node Registration is a unicast Node Confirmation
	   message that contains the status of the binding. The source of the packet
	   is the link-local address of the local ER or LoWPAN Router. The destination address
	   is the link-local address of the node. An Address Option for each confirmed or
	   assigned address is included. Upon successful completion in the Node Confirmation message, the LoWPAN Node sets the address from optimistic or tentative to preferred.
	   See <xref target="messex" /> for detailed message examples.
	   </t>

	   <t>
	   If a Node Confirmation is received with an error code (128 or greater), then the registration has failed. See <xref target="bumess" /> for an explanation of NR/NC codes. If no successful Node Confirmation is received within the timeout (RegistrationTimeout) and number of retries (RegistrationRetries), then there may be no Edge Routers in the LoWPAN. See <xref target="adhoc" /> for more information on ad-hoc network operation.
	   </t>

	   <t>
	   This specification also introduces the concept of a secondary binding.
	   For redundancy, a node might place a secondary binding with one or more
	   other Edge Routers on the same or different LoWPANs. The 'P' flag in the Node Registration Identity Request Option indicates whether the binding is primary. A primary binding MUST be maintained with exactly one Edge Router in each LoWPAN at any time. The use of this mechanism for fault tolerance is explained in <xref target="eroperationfault" />.
	   </t>

	   <t>
         ER and Router bindings have timeouts associated with them, therefore nodes must periodically send a new Node Registration message to renew the bindings. The period between Request NR messages SHOULD be less than BindingLifetime. The period between Refresh NR messages SHOULD be less than AdvertiseInterval. If a node no longer receives Node Confirmation messages from any router in the current subnet, the registration process begins from the beginning. 
	   </t>

      </section>

	<section anchor='sdoperationnh' title="Next-hop determination">

	  <t>
	  The IP address of the next-hop for a destination is determined as follows. Destinations to the link-local prefix (FE80::) are sent on the link to that destination. All other prefixes are assumed to be non-local as the subnet with that prefix may be larger than link-local scope (non-transitive property). They are therefore sent to the IP address of a router chosen from the Default Router List. Address resolution is not normally performed as IIDs are derived from link-layer addresses. If it 
	  must be performed, then hosts look up link-layer information about routers from their Default Router List, and routers about hosts using their Binding Table. Hosts communication directly using link-local addresses (always derived from a link-layer address), and thus don't perform address resolution on each-other. 
	  </t>
	  <t>
	  Multicast addresses are considered to be local and are resolved as specified in <xref target="RFC4944"/> or relative future documents. A LoWPAN Node is not required to be a minimum of one buffer per neighbor as specified in <xref target="RFC4861"/>, as address lookup is not performed as part of next-hop determination.
	  </t>
	   <t>
	   Care must be used with anycast addresses, as anycast address resolution is normally performed with a multicast NS/NA exchange in <xref target="RFC4861"/>.
	   As LoWPAN Nodes are not required to perform address resolution, and do no use NS/NA messages, anycast addresses MUST be considered to be non-local. 
	   </t>

      </section>


	<section anchor='sdoperationqa' title="Destination unreachability detection">

	   <t>
	   LoWPAN Nodes do not perform <xref target="RFC4861"/> address resolution, DAD or NUD. Therefore NS/NA messages are not supported.
	   </t>

	   <t>
         In order to detect unreachable destinations, nodes SHOULD support type 1 ICMPv6 destination unreachable messages <xref target="RFC4443"/>. LoWPAN Routers or Edge Routers make use of ICMPv6 destination unreachable to indicate that delivery to that destination is not possible.

	    LoWPAN Routers are used in a route over configuration

	    Network configuration parameters carried in Router

	    same settings.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    Because Node Registration/Confirmation exchanges between LoWPAN Nodes and LoWPAN Routers only occur over link-local scope, such

	    <t>
	    Network configuration parameters carried in Router
	    Advertisements originate at edge routers and must
	    disseminate to all routers and hosts within the
	    LoWPAN. RAs include either 6LoWPAN Information 
	    Options (one for each context) and a 6LoWPAN 
	    Summary Option, or just a 6LoWPAN Summary 
	    Option.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	    The 6LoWPAN Summary Option is used to support
	    information dissemination from one or more edge routers to
	    all other nodes in the LoWPAN. The option includes a "V"
	    flag which indicates that the information contained in the
	    Router Advertisement is valid. The option also includes a
	    sequence number to ensure that all nodes converge on the
	    same settings. The sequence number is incremented by the originating
	    Edge Router each time the set of prefix information changes. 
	    </t>	    
	    <t>
	    As the number of prefixes or addresses included
	    for context compression in an RA may be large (up to 16), 
	    it is beneficial to avoid the need to always include all options 
	    in every RA. Therefore routers SHOULD only include the 6LoWPAN Prefix
	    Summary Option in unsolicited RAs, unless a set of prefix information with 
	    a new sequence number is being disseminated. In the case of a new sequence 
	    number, or when answering an RS, the router SHOULD include all 6LoWPAN 
	    Information Options in the RA. Therefore a node may use an RS in order 
	    to get the whole prefix information set in case it misses the RA sent when 
	    the sequence number changes.

		Routers maintain an set of information about nodes that are

	      The binding table contains an entry with information such as
	      the registered node's OII, link-local IPv6 address and the advertisement
	      interval from the last NR. If address resolution is required, 
	      the table will also include corresponding link-layer address information.
	    </t>
	  </section>

	  <section title="Processing a Node Registration Message">
	    <t>
	      When a router receives a Node Registration refresh message (Code = 3) 
	      from a node, it immediately reponds to the sender with a Node 
	      Confirmation message (Code = 3). The information in the NR is used to update its
	      binding table.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      When a router receives a Node Registration request message (Code = 0)
	      from a node, it sets the Code field to 1 indicating that
	      the message has been relayed. The IPv6 source address is set to
	      that of the router. Furthermore the checksum is re-calculated and the
	      hop limit is set to 255.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      By default, the router relays Node Registration
	      messages to the 6LOWPAN_ER anycast address. However, the
	      router MAY be configured to use a list of destination
	      addresses, which MAY include unicast addresses, the
	      6LOWPAN_ER anycast address, or other addresses selected
	      by the network administrator. If a target link-layer address option
	      is included, the router SHOULD take this into account as the preferred
	      ER of the node.
	    </t>
	  </section>

	  <section title="Relaying a Node Confirmation Message">
	    <t>
	      When the router receives a Relay Node Confirmation
	      message from an Edge Router, the Code field is set to 1.
	      The Owner Interface Identifier and Address Option are used to form the link-local IPv6 Destination Address for the Node Confirmation message. The IPv6 source address is set to the link-local address of the Router.
	      The Hop Limit of the Node Confirmation message is set to 255.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	  	Upon relaying a successful NC message back to a node, the router SHOULD use the information in the NC to update its Binding Table.

	   decompression between the LoWPAN and the rest of the IP network and ensure MTU
	   compatibility.  Packets flow uncompressed over the Backbone or Backhaul Links
	   and are routed normally towards a Gateway or an Application sitting outside
	   of the LoWPAN.
	   </t>

	   <t> In the Extended LoWPAN case, the Edge Router also performs proxy ND
	   operations over the Backbone Link on behalf of the LoWPAN Nodes that are
	   registered to it. This section also documents the proxy ND operation used by the Edge
	   Routers over the Backbone link and the conflict resolution process that
	   enables transparent micro-mobility for the LoWPAN Nodes.

	<section anchor='eroperationwb' title="The Whiteboard">
	   <t> The Whiteboard is a conceptual data structure that is maintained by the
	   Edge Routers to store their knowledge of the registered LoWPAN Nodes.
	   Information maintained for each registered node includes:
		 <list style="hanging">
		   <t hangText="IPv6 address:">
		     The IPv6 address being registered. This is an IPv6 unicast address of any scope.

	   It can be noted that no link-layer information is stored in the Whiteboard. If the Edge Router is also used as the default gateway for a LoWPAN Node then it would possess LLA information in its Neighbor Cache. Otherwise, it will route packets towards the LoWPAN Nodes and thus will not need or use the LLA of the LoWPAN Node.
	   </t>

	   <t> It can also be noted that in the Extended LoWPAN case, an Edge
	   Router only maintains the information on the LoWPAN Nodes that are registered to it.
	   So the full registry of all the LoWPAN Nodes in a subnet is actually distributed
	   between the Edge Routers.
	   </t>

	   <t> The Whiteboard conceptually requires 177 bits of storage per LoWPAN Node entry, plus 128 bits per IPv6 address. Considerable optimization when realizing a Whiteboard can be made with regard to IPv6 addresses using default prefix, OII and other known information along with lifetimes and TIDs. In practice IPv6 address information can mostly be elided.

   	<section anchor='eroperationsimple' title="Simple LoWPAN">

	   <t>The support of the Simple LoWPAN modality is REQUIRED. In that configuration,
	   a single Edge Router serves a subnet that is formed by the LoWPAN Nodes that are
	   registered to that Edge Router, as represented in <xref target="figsimple"/>.
	   The ER may be connected to an IP infrastructure and may inject the prefixes for
	   its subnet in the routed infrastructure.</t>

	   <t>In a Simple LoWPAN, the Edge Router is the repository of all registrations
	   and can detect a registration collision by simply using its Whiteboard, so
	   the Whiteboard is the reference for Duplicate Address Detection operations.</t>

	   <t>The prefix for the LoWPAN is configured on the Edge Router or acquired using prefix delegation. In the absence of a global IPv6 prefix, an ER may generate a prefix based on Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses (ULAs) as defined in <xref target="RFC4193"/>. A ULA is made up of the prefix fc00::/7, a global ID and a subnet ID. The global ID is randomly generated, and the subnet ID is not used. The Edge Router is responsible for the generation of the ULA prefix to be advertised to the LoWPAN and used by all nodes. ULA generation may use the algorithm suggested Section 3.2.2 of <xref target="RFC4193"/> or something appropriate to the Edge Router's capabilities. </t>

         <t>The Edge Router forms a link-local address in exactly the same way
	   as any other node on the LoWPAN, for instance based on its link layer
	   addresses to enable 6LoWPAN Header Compression. If the resulting address
	   is not present in the Whiteboard then the Edge Router owns the address
	   right away. The Edge Router announces itself using Router Advertisement (RA) messages that are broadcasted periodically over the LOWPAN.

	<section anchor='eroperationexp' title="Extended LoWPAN">

	   <t>The support of the Extended LoWPAN modality is OPTIONAL. In that modality,
	   a high speed Backbone Link interconnects multiple devices and Edge Routers to form a single subnet that encompasses IPv6 nodes attached to the Backbone Link and LoWPAN Nodes registered
	   to the Edge Routers as represented in <xref target="figextended"/>. As a result,
	   all further reference to the Backbone Link and ND proxy operation 
	   over that link is OPTIONAL but come as a whole.</t>

	   <t>
	   In the Extended LoWPAN modality, the Backbone Link is used as a reference for address ownership and registration collision detection. Addresses that are not found in the Whiteboard are queried over the backbone using the ND operation in place for that type of link, typically <xref target="RFC4861"/>;
	   Edge Routers represent themselves and the LoWPAN Nodes that are proactively registered to them. An ND lookup over the backbone is not propagated over the LoWPANs,
	   but answered by the Edge Router that has the registration for the target, if any.
	   </t>

   	   <t>
	   To enable proxying over the Backbone Link, an Edge Router must join the
	   solicited-node multicast address on that link for all the registered
	   addresses of the nodes in its LoWPANs. The Edge Router answers the
	   Neighbor Solicitation with a Neighbor Advertisement that indicates its own
	   link-layer address in the Target link-layer address option.
	   </t>

	   <t>
	   As all ERs in an Extended LoWPAN advertise the same subnet prefix on their LoWPAN interfaces, ERs acquire their LoWPAN subnet prefix from the backbone link as in <xref target="RFC4861"/>. In the absence of a global IPv6 address, an IPv6 router can alternatively advertise a ULA prefix as defined in <xref target='eroperationsimple'/>.

	   The Backbone Link Maximum Transmission Unit serves as base for Path MTU
	   discovery and Transport layer Maximum Segment Size negotiation (see

There SHOULD be only one Edge Router in an Ad-hoc LoWPAN (just as in a Simple LoWPAN) to keep consistency in the Whiteboard and ULA prefix.

	   <t>An Edge Router configures the well-known 6LOWPAN_ER anycast
	   address on the LoWPAN interfaces where it serves as Edge Router. Note that
	   the Edge Router will accept Node Registration messages with a hop limit that is

	   </t>

	   <t>The Edge Router responds to a Node Registration with a Node Confirmation.
	   If the source address of the NR was not the Unspecified Address, then the
	   destination address in the confirmation is the source in the NR.
	   If the source address of the NR was the Unspecified Address, then the ER
	   acts as the LoWPAN Router for the source, and the destination address is the
	   optimistic address being registered. The destination link-layer address
	   is not taken from the ND cache but from the source link-layer address in the
	   NR. The source address is a unicast address of the ER that matches the scope
	   of the destination, preferably the destination in the NR if it is not anycast.
	   </t>

	   <t>The remainder of this section deals with the case of an Extended LoWPAN
	   configuration. In that case:
	   </t>
	   <t>When it inserts an address in its Whiteboard, an Edge Router SHOULD
	   perform Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) over the Backbone Link to detect a collision.
	   Upon a new registration for a link-local, unique local or global unicast address
	   based on an IEEE 64-bit extended MAC address, the Edge Router MAY use
	   <xref target="RFC4429">Optimistic DAD</xref> on the Backbone Link.
	   A positive acknowledgement can be sent to the 6LoWPAN node right away if oDAD is used on the Backbone Link.
	   </t>

	   <t>
	   A LoWPAN Node should be able to join a different Edge Router at any
	   time without the complexities of terminating a current registration
	   and renumbering. To enable this, the ND operation on the Backbone
	   Link upon a Node Registration/Confirmation flow wins the address ownership over an
	   ND operation that is done asynchronously, on behalf of the same
	   LoWPAN Node, upon a prior registration. So an Edge Router that would
	   happen to have a binding for that same address for the same LoWPAN Node
	   will yield and depreciate its binding.
	   </t>

	   <t> The override (O) bit is used to
	   differentiate a registration flow from the asynchronous defense of an address
	   by an Edge Router acting as a proxy. Upon a registration flow, an Edge Router
	   doing DAD or accepting a reregistration SHOULD set the override (O) bit in
	   its NA messages. Asynchronously to the registration, the Edge Router 
	   SHOULD NOT set the override (O) bit in its NA messages and should yield 
	   to an NA message with the override (O) bit set.
	   </t>

	   <t>
         So the Edge Router operation on the Backbone Link is similar to that of
         a Home Agent as specified in <xref target="RFC3775">"Mobility Support for
         IPv6"</xref> yet different. In particular, the Neighbor Advertisement
         message is used as specified in section "10.4.1. Intercepting Packets
         for a Mobile Node" with the exception that the override (O) bit is not
         set, indicating that this Edge Router acts as a proxy for the LoWPAN and
         will yield should another Edge Router claim that address on the Backbone Link.
	   </t>

	   <t>
	   This specification also introduces the concept of a secondary binding.
	   Upon a secondary binding, the Edge Router will not announce or defend
	   the address on the backbone link, but will be able to forward packets to
	   the node over its LoWPAN interface. This feature is used for fault tolerance,
	   explained in <xref target="eroperationfault" />.
	   </t>

	   <t>
	   If the Edge Router is primary for a registration as indicated by the
	   'P' flag and it is connected to a Backbone, then it SHOULD perform ND operations on the backbone. In particular the Edge Router SHOULD reject the
	   registration if DAD fails on the backbone. When oDAD is used over the
	   backbone the Edge Router MAY issue the Node Confirmation right away
	   with a positive code, but if a collision is finally detected, it cancels
	   the registration with an asynchronous Node Confirmation and a negative
	   completion code on the same TID.
	   </t>

	   <t>
	   If the NR message includes an Address Option with the 'A' flag set, this
	   indicated the request of short address generation. The ER acquires an appropriate, unique
	   link-layer address for the network either by generating it and performing DAD, or
	   with some other method. If successful, this address is returned in an Address Option of
	   the NC with the 'A' flag set. The IPv6 address is formed from the generated link-layer address with the default prefix inline.
	   </t>

      </section>

	<section anchor='eroperationforw' title="Forwarding packets between a LoWPAN and an IPv6 infrastructure">

	   <t>
	   Upon receiving packets on one of its LoWPAN interfaces, the Edge
	   Router checks whether it has a binding for the source address.
	   If it does, then the Edge Router can forward the packet;
	   otherwise, the Edge Router MUST discard the packet.
	     </t>
		 <t> If the packet is to be transmitted over a Backbone or Backhaul Link, then the 6LoWPAN sublayer
	   is terminated and the full IPv6 packet is reassembled and expanded.
	   When forwarding a packet from the Backbone or Backhaul Link towards a LoWPAN interface,
	   the Edge Router performs the 6LoWPAN sublayer operations of compression and
	   fragmentation and passes the packet to the lower layer for transmission.
	   </t>

		 <t>From the standpoint of an Edge Router, the view of the subnet in the Extended LoWPAN modality
		is that all nodes in the subnet are either LoWPAN nodes registered to this ER
		 or local on the Backbone Link, though in fact
	   they might be proxied for by other ERs. If the destination is a LoWPAN node
	   registered to this ER, the ER will forward the packet over the LoWPAN interface either as a local
	   delivery if the node is local or via intermediate LoWPAN routers using the routing in place in the LoWPAN.
	   If the destination is not a registered LoWPAN node, then the ER acts as if the subnet was local on the
	   Backbone and looks up the node there using ND. If the node is not found there either, it is assumed unreachable
	   and an "Destination Unreachable" ICMP message is sent to the source as prescribed by  <xref target="RFC4443"/>.

      <section anchor='eroperationdad' title="Address collision detection and resolution">


      <t>The assumption in this section is that the OII that is carried in the
	  registration messages and in the NS/NA messages is globally unique.
	  When this assumption fails, this is detected by an additional collision resolution mechanism, as detailed in <xref target="eroperationduplicate" />.
	  </t>

	  <t>The address collision can be detected within the Edge Router if the
	  Edge Router already has a registration for a given address, or over the
	  Backbone Link using Duplicate Address Detection. In the latter case,
	  a new ND option, the Owner Interface Identifier Option is used in NS/NA messages to carry
	  the additional information required for the resolution of conflicts: Transaction ID, Owner Interface Identifier, and Owner Nonce. In any case, the Edge Router in charge
	  of the resolution is the Edge Router that handles the registration.</t>


	  <t>A registration is identified by the (OII, IPv6 address) pair. A conflict occurs
	  when a Node Registration is received for an IPv6 address that is already
	  registered with a different OII at the same or another Edge Router. The
	  resolution of such conflict is explained below.
	  </t>

	  <t>Additionally, the following principles apply to the resolution in the Extended LoWPAN modality:
	  <list>
	  <t>Mobility within a subnet is supported and welcome. In an Extended LoWPAN,
	  a LoWPAN Node may migrate its registration to a new
	  Edge Router transparently and at any time. The protocol is designed to recognize
	  the mobility and silently cleanup the registration states.
	  </t>
	  <t>A synchronous operation wins against a delayed proxy operation. An Edge Router
	  that processes a Node Registration normally takes over an existing registration
	  maintained by a defendant Edge Router.
	  </t>
	  <t>The decision to migrate the registration from an Edge Router to another is
	  made by the Edge Router that processes a Node Registration message based on
	  its own states for that registration and ND exchanges over the Backbone
	  Link.
	  </t>
	  <t> A conflict may also occur with a node that is already present on the Backbone
	  Link when the registration occurs, or with a node that appears on the Backbone Link while
	  a registration already exists for its claimed address.
	  The resolution of such conflict is done using standard Duplicate Address Detection
	  as prescribed by <xref target="RFC4862"/>.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	  A claim for an address with a better proof of ownership wins. For instance
   a node on the backbone that proves ownership of an address by means of 
   Secure ND <xref target="RFC3971"/> wins over a node that does not. The concept of "better"
   is a policy and is not specified hereafter, though it is REQUIRED for an
   implementation to enable the enforcement of such a policy.
	  </t>
	  </list>
	  </t>

	  <t>Upon receiving a Node Registration message, an Edge Router looks up an existing
	  registration for that IPv6 address in its LoWPAN whiteboard. If the entry
	  does not exist then the Edge Router looks up the address over the Backbone
	  Link using the NS (DAD) mechanism. The Edge Router SHOULD include an Owner Interface
	  Identifier Option in the NS message. An Edge Router that defends that address
	  for an existing registration MUST include an Owner Interface
	  Identifier Option in the NA message and SHOULD NOT set the Override (O) bit.
	  </t>
	  <t>If no entry is found for that address and DAD times out, the Edge Router
	  accepts the registration:
	  it creates an entry on the whiteboard, sends a positive Node Confirmation Message
	  to the node, and advertises the address on the Backbone Link.
	  Since this happens asynchronously to the Node Registration, the Edge Router
	  SHOULD NOT set Override (O) bit in the NA message.
	  </t>
	  <t>If an entry is found in the whiteboard for the same (OII, IPv6 address) pair,
	  additional checking is performed for duplicate OII detection as detailed in
	  <xref target="eroperationduplicate"/>. If no duplication is detected, then the
	  Edge Router accepts the update of the reservation: it updates the entry on the
	  whiteboard, sends a positive Node Confirmation Message to the node, and
	  advertises the address on the Backbone Link. Since this happens synchronously
	  to the Node Registration, the Edge Router SHOULD set the Override (O) bit in the
	  NA message.
 	  </t>
	  <t>If the address is already present on the Backbone Link and defended by

	  <t> If the Edge Router receives an NA message during the DAD period, it
	  checks for an Owner Interface Identifier Option in the NA message.
	  If there is no OII or the (O) bit is set then this is a duplicate address,
	  DAD fails and the registration is rejected. If there is an Owner Interface
	  Identifier Option in the NA message and the OII is different, then DAD fails and
	  the registration is rejected. If the OII is the same, additional checking is
	  performed for duplicate OII detection as detailed in
	  <xref target="eroperationduplicate"/>. If there is no duplication then the NA is
	  ignored and the DAD timer keeps going.</t>

	  <t> If the Edge Router receives an NS (DAD) message from another node during the
	  DAD period, it checks for a Owner Interface Identifier Option in the NS message.
	  If there is no OII then DAD fails and the registration is rejected.
	  If there is an Owner Interface Identifier Option in the NA message and
	  the OII is different, then DAD fails and the registration is rejected. If the OII
	  is the same, then the greatest TID wins. In other words, if the TID in the
	  registration is smaller than or equal to the TID in the OII Option then DAD fails
	  and the registration is rejected.  Otherwise the NS is ignored and the DAD timer
	  keeps going.

      <section anchor='eroperationduplicate' title="Duplicate OII detection">
        <t>
          The address collision detection mechanism described in the
          previous section only works if OII values are unique to each
          node. The
          purpose of the duplicate OII detection mechanism specified
          in this section is to find out where this is not the case.
          Note that such an OII collision is a "cannot happen", as the
          EUI-64 assignment mechanisms are supposed to ensure its
          uniqueness.  Still, accidents (as well as deliberate rogue
          behavior, e.g. by counterfeiters) do happen.  The objective
          here is to reliably detect, not to remedy, such a situation.
        </t>
        <!--
            This section should deal with the behavior of the ERs in the following cases. 1. A node changes its primary registration from one ER to another (TID increases). 2. A node
      reboots and registers again with the same or a new ER (TID resets). 3. A node enters a
      network on accident or maliciously using an OII (EUI-64) which already is in use in the network. -->
        <t>
          In conjunction with the OII,
          two values are sent in each Node Registration (and in the
          OII option sent with NS/NA) to help with duplicate OII
          detection: The transaction ID (TID) and the Owner Nonce.
          The TID is a sequence number that is also used to control
          the normal operation of a registration exchange, relating a
          node confirmation to its node registration.
          The TID is set by a node in its Node Registration message
          and echoed by the Edge Router in the Node Confirmation
          message.
        </t>
        <t>
          The TID is maintained using the lollipop mechanism.
	  When a node starts or restarts, it sets its local next TID to
          zero and its local Owner Nonce to a random value.
          (While cryptographic randomness <xref target="RFC4086"/> is
          not strictly required, the randomness SHOULD be derived
          using a mechanism of similar quality.)
          After that, the node
	  increments the local next TID after sending each Request Node
          Registration, but keeps the Owner Nonce constant. When the
          TID needs to be incremented beyond its maximum
	  value (0xFF), it wraps directly to its looping value at the base of the lollipop
	  that is 16 (0x10). So a value in the straight part of the lollipop (between 0 and 0xF)
	  is only used after a reboot and before the circular part of the lollipop is entered.
        </t>
        <t>
	  Upon a positive Node Confirmation, if the current local next TID is less than 16,
	  then the node sets it to 16. 
          Regardless of its current local next TID, a node that has
          not heard a valid Node Confirmation for 16
          Node Registration messages in a row restarts with a local next
          TID of zero (the node MAY, but need not, generate a new Owner Nonce).
          In summary, this means a TID less than 16 (in the straight
          part of the lollipop) denotes a node that
	  just started/restarted and did not get registered yet (or
          did not hear the acknowledgement), so we call such a TID an
          unacknowledged TID; conversely, TIDs of 16 or larger are
          acknowledged TIDs.
        </t>
        <t>
          To compare TID1 and TID2, the following rules apply:
          <list>
            <t>
              If at least one of TID1 and TID2 is unacknowledged
              (smaller than 16) then they compare directly.

            <t>
              If both TID1 and TID2 are acknowledged, then TID2 is greater than TID1 if
              (TID2 - TID1) is smaller than (TID1 - TID2).
            </t>
	  </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          A TID value is consistent with the preceding one if it is
          the same or a small increment
	  or decrement (more by or less by 0 to 16) from the preceding
          one.
          <!-- During normal operations, the TIDs saved in
	  the white board entry should be consistent. -->
          <!-- Two TIDs are strictly consistent if they are consistent and not the same. -->
	  If the TID arriving in a Node Registration message at an
          Edge Router is the same or a small decrement as a preceding
          one, then a registration message was duplicated or two of them crossed and the
          most recent message should be ignored; this is not necessarily an
          indication of an OII collision.
        </t>
        <t>
          A Node Registration message is consistent with the
          Whiteboard entry if the TIDs are consistent and the Owner
          Nonce values are the same.
          As long a new Node Registration message is consistent with
	  the current whiteboard entry, it appears that the new
          message is coming from the same source as
	  the previous one and there is no OII collision.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the TID in a new Node Registration message jumps back to
          an unacknowledged value, this can be interpreted as
	  either a new node competing for the OII and a reboot by the node owning the
	  registration.
	  With this specification, this situation is optimistically interpreted as a reboot
	  and not detected as a collision, but an actual collision will be detected and
	  filtered out next.
          For now, TID and OII from the new Node Registration message
          are copied into the Whiteboard entry.
        </t>
        <t>
          Otherwise, i.e., the TID in a new Node Registration is an
          acknowledged TID, if that is inconsistent with the most
          recently accepted TID value, or if the Owner Nonce values do not match,
          <!-- XXX: ???
               then the Edge Router compares with the
               older TID values that are saved in the whiteboard entry for that registration.
               This might occur for instance with an entry that was rendered non-operational
               when the address was taken over by another Edge Router.
               </t>
               <t>
               If the new value is consistent with a recent value then
               it appears that 2
               sources are competing for the same OII and an OII collision should be logged.
               In that case the greater TID wins, that is if the new TID is greater than the
               previous one it is accepted, otherwise it is reported as a collision.
               </t>
               <t>
               If the new value is not consistent with a recent value saved in the whiteboard
               entry
          -->
          then the Node Registration message is rejected as an OII collision.

	  This section provides basic examples of messages and options from
	  this document.

	<section title="Basic NR/NC message exchange">

	<t>In the basic case, when a host wanting to register to the whiteboard is
	on the same link with an ER, a simple NR/NC request message exchange occurs.
	In this example a host wants to register its address generated with Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SAA), and in addition requests a generated short address.</t>

	<t>First the Host sends an NR message to the link-local address of the ER. In this example the host wants to use the Edge Router as primary,
	a 10 minute binding lifetime, a 60 second advertisement interval , and its modified EUI-64 as the Owner Interface Identifier. The
	message has two Address Options. The host has just booted, therefore the TID
	starts with 0. This example assumes that the LoWPAN prefix has been assigned 
	CID 0.</t>

	<section title="Security Considerations">

	<t>
	   The security considerations of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery <xref target="RFC4861"/>
	   apply.  Additional considerations can be found in <xref target="RFC3756"/>.
	</t>
	<t>
	   This specification expects that the link layer is sufficiently
	   protected, either by means of physical or IP security for the
	   backbone link or MAC sublayer cryptography.  In other words, model
	   1 from <xref target="RFC3756"/> applies.  In particular, it is expected that the
	   LoWPAN MAC provides secure unicast to/from Routers and secure
	   broadcast from the Routers in a way that prevents tampering with or
	   replaying the RA messages.  However, any future 6LoWPAN security
	   protocol that applies to Neighbor Discovery for 6LoWPAN protocol,
	   is out of scope of this document.
	</t>
	<t>
	   The use of EUI-64 for forming the Interface ID in the link local
	   address prevents the usage of Secure ND (<xref target="RFC3971"/> and <xref target="RFC3972"/>) and
	   address privacy techniques.  Considering the envisioned deployments
	   and the MAC layer security applied, this is not considered an issue
	   at this time. 
	</t>
	<t>
	   The use of Secure ND has been considered for securing NS/NA messages exchanged
	   between Edge Routers on the backbone link.
	</t>
	<t>
	   The use of IP-level forwarding of NR/NC ND messages requires relaxed
	   checking of Hop Limit values in ND packets received, compared to
	   the validation required by <xref target="RFC4861"/>.  This may make ND vulnerable to
	   off-LoWPAN senders that accidentally or intentionally send ND
	   messages.  This specification states that Edge Routers MUST
	   implement measures to filter out such off-LoWPAN ND messages.

	<section title="IANA Considerations">
         <t>
      	This document requires two new ICMPv6 message types:

       	<list style="symbols">
       		<t>Node Registration (TBD1)</t>
       		<t>Node Confirmation (TBD2)</t>
       	</list>

      	The document also requires four new ND option types under the
      	subregistry "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option Formats":

      	<list style="symbols">
       		<t>Address Option (TBD3)</t>
       		<t>6LoWPAN Information Option (TBD4)</t>
       		<t>6LoWPAN Summary Option (TBD5)</t>
       		<t>Owner Interface Identifier Option (TBD6)</t>
       	</list>
         </t>

         <t>
      	[TO BE REMOVED: This registration should take place at the following location:
       	http://www.iana.org/assignments/icmpv6-parameters]
	   </t>

	   <t>
	      There is also the need for a new
      	link local anycast address, 6LOWPAN_ER for 6LoWPAN edge routers
      	and Routers; used as a functional address.

	<section title="Changelog">

	  <t>Changes from -05 to -06:
	    <list>
	    	 <t>o Fixed the Prf codes (#52).</t>
	    	 <t>o Corrected the OIIO TID field to 8-bits. Changed the Nonce/OII order in both the OIIO and the NR/NC. (#53)</t>
	    	 <t>o Corrected an error in Table 1 (#54).</t>
	    	 <t>o Fixed assymetric and a misplaced transient in the 6lowpan terminology section.</t>
	    	 <t>o Added Updates RFC4861 to header</t>
	    </list>
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>Changes from -04 to -05:
	    <list>
	    	 <t>o Meaning of the RA's M-bit changed to original <xref target="RFC4861"/> meaning (#46).</t>
	    	 <t>o Terms "local" and "non-local" used in place of "on-link" and "off-link".</t>
	    	 <t>o Next-hop determination text simplified (#49).</t>
	    	 <t>o Neighbor cache and destination cache removed.</t>
	    	 <t>o IID to link-layer address requirement relaxed. </t>
	    	 <t>o NR/NC changes to enable local refresh with routers (#48).</t>
	    	 <t>o Modified 6LoWPAN Information Option (#47).</t>
	    	 <t>o Added a Protocol Constants section (#24)</t>
	    	 <t>o Added the NR processing table (#51)</t>
	    	 <t>o Considered the use of SeND on backbone NS/NA messages (#50)</t>
	    </list>
	  </t>  
	    	 

	  <t>Changes from -03 to -04:
	    <list>
	    	 <t>o Moved Ad-hoc LoWPAN operation to Section 7 and made ULA prefix generation a features useful also in Simple and Extended LoWPANs. (#41)</t>
		 <t>o Added a 32-bit Owner Nonce to the NR/NC messages and the Whiteboard, removed the TID history. (#39)</t>
		 <t>o Improved the duplicate OII detection algorithm using the Owner Nonce. (#39)</t>
		 <t>o Clarified the use of Source and Target link-layer options in NR/NC. (#43)</t>
		 <t>o Included text on the use of alternative methods to aquire addresses. (#38)</t>
		 <t>o Removed S=2 from Address Option (not needed). (#36)</t>
		 <t>o Added a section on router dissemination consistency. (#44)</t>
		 <t>o Small improvements and extensive editing. (#42, #37, #35)</t>
	    </list>
	  </t>

	  <t>Changes from -02 to -03:
	    <list>
	    	<t>o Updated terminology, with RFC4861 non-transitive link model.</t>
		<t>o 6LoWPAN and ND terminology separated.</t>
		<t>o Protocol overview explains RFC4861 diff in detail.</t>
		<t>o RR/RC is now Node Registration/Confirmation (NR/NC).</t>
		<t>o Added NR failure codes.</t>
		<t>o ER Metric now included in 6LoWPAN Summary Option for use in default router determination by hosts.</t>
		<t>o Examples of host data structures, and the Whiteboard given.</t>
		<t>o Whiteboard is supported by all Edge Routers for option simplicity.</t>
		<t>o Edge Router Specification chapter re-structured, clarifying optional Extended LoWPAN operation.</t>
		<t>o NS/NA now completely optional for nodes. No address resolution or NS/NA NUD required.</t>
		<t>o Link-local operation now compatible with oDAD (was broken).</t>
		<t>o Exception to hop limit = 255 for NR/NC messages.</t>
		<t>o Security considerations improved.</t>
		<t>o ICMPv6 destination unreachable supported.</t> 
	    </list>
	  </t>

	  <t>Changes from -01 to -02:
	    <list>
	    	<t>o Fixed 16 != 0xff bug (ticket closed).</t>
	    	<t>o Specified use of ULAs in ad-hoc LoWPAN section 9 (ticket closed).</t>
	    	<t>o Terminology cleanup based on Alex's comments.</t>
	    	<t>o General editing improvements.</t>
	    </list>
	  </t>

	  <t>Changes from -00 to -01:
	    <list>
	    	<t>o Specified the duplicate owner interface identifier procedures. A TID lollypop algorithm was sufficient (nonce unnecessary).</t>
	    	<t>o Defined fault tolerance using secondary bindings.</t>
	    	<t>o Defined ad-hoc network operation.</t>
	    	<t>o Removed the E flag from RA and the X flag from RR/RC.</t>
	    	<t>o Completed message examples.</t>
	    	<t>o Lots of improvements in text quality and consistency were made. </t>
	    </list>

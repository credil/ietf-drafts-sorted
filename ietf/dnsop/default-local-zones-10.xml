      <t>
	Experience with the Domain Name System (DNS, <xref
	target="RFC1034" /> and <xref target="RFC1035" />) has shown
	that there are a number of DNS zones that all iterative
	resolvers and recursive nameservers SHOULD automatically
	serve, unless intentionally configured otherwise.  These
	zones include, but are not limited to, the IN-ADDR.ARPA
	zones for the address space allocated by <xref target="RFC1918"
	/> and the IP6.ARPA zones for locally assigned unique local
	IPv6 addresses defined in <xref target="RFC4193" />.
      </t>
      <t>
	This recommendation is made because data has shown that
	significant leakage of queries for these name spaces is
	occurring, despite instructions to restrict them, and because
	it has therefore become necessary to deploy sacrificial 
	name servers to protect the immediate parent name servers
	for these zones from excessive, unintentional, query load
	<xref target="AS112" />
	<xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-dnsop-as112-ops" />
	<xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-dnsop-as112-under-attack-help-help" />.
	There is every expectation that the query load will continue
	to increase unless steps are taken as outlined here.
      </t>
      <t>
	Additionally, queries from clients behind badly configured
	firewalls that allow outgoing queries for these name spaces
	but drop the responses, put a significant load on the root
	servers (forward but no reverse zones configured).  They
	also cause operational load for the root server operators
	as they have to reply to enquiries about why the root servers
	are "attacking" these clients.  Changing the default
	configuration will address all these issues for the zones
	listed in <xref target="list" />.
      </t>
      <t>
	<xref target="RFC4193" /> recommends that queries for
	D.F.IP6.ARPA be handled locally.  This document extends the
	recommendation to cover the IN-ADDR.ARPA zones for <xref
	target="RFC1918" /> and other well known IN-ADDR.ARPA and
	IP6.ARPA zones for which queries should not appear on the
	public Internet.
      </t>
      <t>
	It is hoped that by doing this the number of sacrificial
	servers <xref target="AS112" /> will not have to be increased,
	and may in time be reduced.
      </t>
      <t>
	This recommendation should also help DNS responsiveness for
	sites which are using <xref target="RFC1918" /> addresses
	but do not follow the last paragraph in Section 3 of <xref
	target="RFC1918" />.
      </t>

	  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
	  "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
	  and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
	  described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.
	</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section toc="yes" anchor="effects" title="Effects
    on sites using RFC 1918 addresses.">
      <t>
	For most sites using <xref target="RFC1918" /> addresses,
	the changes here will have little or no detrimental effect.
	If the site does not already have the reverse tree populated
	the only effect will be that the name error responses will
	be generated locally rather than remotely.
      </t>
      <t>
	For sites that do have the reverse tree populated, most
	will either have a local copy of the zones or will be
	forwarding the queries to servers which have local copies
	of the zone.  Therefore this recommendation will not be
	relevant.
      </t>
      <t>
	The most significant impact will be felt at sites that make
	use of delegations for <xref target="RFC1918" /> addresses
	and have populated these zones.  These sites will need to
	override the default configuration expressed in this document
	to allow resolution to continue.  Typically, such sites
	will be fully disconnected from the Internet and have their
	own root servers for their own non-Internet DNS tree.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section toc="yes" anchor="full" title="Changes to
    Iterative Resolver Behaviour.">
      <t>
	Unless configured otherwise, an iterative resolver will now
	return authoritatively (aa=1) name errors (RCODE=3) for
	queries within the zones in <xref target="list" />, with
	the obvious exception of queries for the zone name itself
	where SOA, NS and "no data" responses will be returned as
	appropriate to the query type.  One common way to do this
	all at once is to serve empty (SOA and NS only) zones.
      </t>
      <t>
	An implementation of this recommendation MUST provide a
	mechanism to disable this new behaviour, and SHOULD allow
	this decision on a zone by zone basis.
      </t>
      <t>
	If using empty zones one SHOULD NOT use the same NS and SOA
	records as used on the public Internet servers as that will
	make it harder to detect the origin of the responses and
	thus any leakage to the public Internet servers.  This
	document recommends that the NS record defaults to the name
	of the zone and the SOA MNAME defaults to the name of the
	only NS RR's target.  The SOA RNAME should default to
	"nobody.invalid." <xref target="RFC2606" />.  Implementations
	SHOULD provide a mechanism to set these values.  No address
	records need to be provided for the name server.
      </t>
      <t>
	Below is an example of a generic empty zone in master file
	format.  It will produce a negative cache TTL of 3 hours.
      </t>
      <figure>
	<artwork>
@ 10800 IN SOA @ nobody.invalid. 1 3600 1200 604800 10800
@ 10800 IN NS @
	</artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>
	The SOA RR is needed to support negative caching <xref
	target="RFC2308" /> of name error responses and to point
	clients to the primary master for DNS dynamic updates.
      </t>
      <t>
	SOA values of particular importance are the MNAME, the SOA
	RR's TTL and the negTTL value.  Both TTL values SHOULD
	match.  The rest of the SOA timer values MAY be chosen
	arbitrarily since they are not intended to control any zone
	transfer activity.
      </t>
      <t>
	The NS RR is needed as some UPDATE <xref target="RFC2136"
	/> clients use NS queries to discover the zone to be updated.
	Having no address records for the name server is expected
	to abort UPDATE processing in the client.

	/> Sections 2.4 and 2.5.7), and IPv6 Non-Locally Assigned
	Local addresses (<xref target="RFC4193" />) are not covered
	here.
      </t>
      <t>
	It is expected that IPv6 site-local addresses will be self
	correcting as IPv6 implementations remove support for
	site-local addresses.  However, sacrificial servers for the
	zones C.E.F.IP6.ARPA through F.E.F.IP6.ARPA may still need
	to be deployed in the short term if the traffic becomes
	excessive.
      </t>

      <t>
	For IPv6 Non-Locally Assigned Local addresses (L = 0) <xref
	target="RFC4193" />, there has been no decision made about
	whether the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) will provide
	delegations in this space or not.  If they don't, then
	C.F.IP6.ARPA will need to be added to the list in <xref

	need to take steps to ensure that name servers are provided

      </t>
      <t>
	This document also ignores IP6.INT.  IP6.INT has been
	wound up with only legacy resolvers now generating reverse
	queries under IP6.INT <xref target="RFC4159" />.
      </t>
      <t>
	This document has also deliberately ignored names immediately
	under the root domain.  While there is a subset of queries
	to the root name servers which could be addressed using the
	techniques described here (e.g. .local, .workgroup and IPv4
	addresses), there is also a vast amount of traffic that
	requires a different strategy (e.g. lookups for unqualified
	hostnames, IPv6 addresses).

    </section>
    <section toc="yes" anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
	This document requests that IANA establish a registry of
	zones which require this default behaviour. The initial
	contents of this registry are defined in <xref target="list"
	/>.  Implementors are encouraged to periodically check this
	registry and adjust their implementations to reflect changes
	therein.
      </t>
      <t>
	This registry can be amended through "IETF Review" as per
	<xref target="RFC5226" />.
      </t>
      <t>
	IANA should co-ordinate with the RIRs to ensure that, as DNSSEC
	is deployed in the reverse tree, delegations for these zones are
	made in the manner described in <xref target="security" />.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section toc="yes" anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
	During the initial deployment phase, particularly where
	<xref target="RFC1918" /> addresses are in
	use, there may be some clients that unexpectedly receive a
	name error rather than a PTR record.  This may cause some
	service disruption until their recursive name server(s)
	have been re-configured.
      </t>
      <t>
	As DNSSEC is deployed within the IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA
	namespaces, the zones listed above will need to be delegated
	as insecure delegations, or be within insecure zones.  This
	will allow DNSSEC validation to succeed for queries in these
	spaces despite not being answered from the delegated servers.
      </t>
      <t>
	It is recommended that sites actively using these namespaces
	secure them using DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4035" /> by
	publishing and using DNSSEC trust anchors.  This will protect
	the clients from accidental import of unsigned responses
	from the Internet.

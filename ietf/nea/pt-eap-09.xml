		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>This document specifies PT-EAP, a Posture Transport (PT) protocol
				protected by a TLS protected EAP tunnel method.
			    The PT protocol in the NEA architecture is responsible for transporting 
				Posture Broker (PB-TNC <xref target="RFC5793"/>) batches (often containing Posture Attributes [PA-TNC <xref target="RFC5792"/>] attributes) across
				the network between the NEA Client and NEA Server.  The PT-EAP protocol 
				must be protected by an outer TLS-based EAP tunnel method to ensure the exchanged messages are 
				protected from a variety of threats from hostile intermediaries.</t>
			<t> NEA protocols are intended to be used both for pre-admission assessment of endpoints 
				joining the network and to assess endpoints already present on the network.  In order 
				to support both usage models, two types of PT protocols are needed.  One type of PT, PT-TLS 
                <xref target="I-D.ietf-nea-pt-tls"/>,  
				operates after the endpoint has an assigned IP address, layering on top of the IP 
				protocol to carry a NEA exchange.  The other type of PT operates before the endpoint 
				gains any access to the IP network. This specification defines PT-EAP, the PT 
				protocol used to assess endpoints before they gain access to the network.</t>
			<t> PT-EAP is an inner EAP <xref target="RFC3748"/> method designed to be used 
				inside a protected tunnel such as TEAP <xref target="I-D.ietf-emu-eap-tunnel-method"/>, EAP-FAST <xref target="RFC4851"/> 
				or EAP-TTLS <xref target="RFC5281"/>.  That is, an outer EAP method is typically a TLS-based EAP method that first establishes a protected tunnel by which other conversations, such as other EAP methods (e.g. "inner" EAP methods) can ensue under the tunnel protection. </t>

			<section title="Prerequisites">
				<t>This document does not define an architecture or reference model.  Instead, it defines a 
					protocol that works within the reference model described in the NEA Requirements 
					specification <xref target="RFC5209"/>.  The reader is assumed to be thoroughly familiar 
					with that document.</t>
			</section>
			<section anchor="Conventions" title="Message Diagram Conventions">
				<t> This specification defines the syntax of PT-EAP messages using diagrams.  
					Each diagram depicts the format and size of each field in bits.  Implementations 
					MUST send the bits in each diagram as they are shown, traversing the diagram from 
					top to bottom and then from left to right within each line (which represents a
					32-bit quantity).  Multi-byte fields representing numeric values MUST be sent in 
					network (big endian) byte order.</t>
				<t> Descriptions of bit field (e.g. flag) values are described referring to the 
					position of the bit within the field.  These bit positions are numbered from the
					most significant bit through the least significant bit so a one octet field with
					only bit 0 set has the value 0x80.</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Terminology">
				<t> This document reuses many terms defined in the NEA Requirements document 
					<xref target="RFC5209"/>, such as Posture Transport Client and Posture Transport Server. 
					The reader is assumed to have read that document and understood it.</t>
				<t>When defining the PT-EAP method, this specification does not use the terms "EAP peer" 
					and "EAP authenticator". Instead, it uses the terms "NEA Client" and "NEA Server"
					since those are considered to be more familiar to NEA WG participants. However, 
					these terms are equivalent for the purposes of these specifications. The part
					of the NEA Client that terminates PT-EAP (generally in the Posture Transport 
					Client) is the EAP peer for PT-EAP. The part of the NEA Server that terminates 
					PT-EAP (generally in the Posture Transport Server) is the EAP authenticator for PT-EAP.</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Conventions used in this document">
				<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in 
					<xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Compatibility with other Specifications">
				<t>One of the goals of the NEA effort is to deliver a single set of
					endpoint assessment standards, agreed upon by all parties. For
					this reason, the authors understand that the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) will be replacing
					its existing posture transport protocols with new versions that
					are equivalent to and interoperable with the NEA specifications.</t>
				</section>
		</section>
		<section title="Use of PT-EAP">
			<t> PT-EAP is designed to encapsulate PB-TNC batches in a simple EAP method 
				that can be carried within EAP tunnel methods. The EAP tunnel methods 
				provide confidentiality and message integrity, so PT-EAP does not have 
				to do so. Therefore, PT-EAP MUST be used inside a TLS-based EAP tunnel 
				method that provides strong cryptographic authentication (possibly 
				server only), message integrity and confidentiality services.</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Definition of PT-EAP">
			<t> The PT-EAP protocol operates between a Posture Transport Client and a Posture 
				Transport Server, allowing them to send PB-TNC batches to each other over an EAP 
				tunnel method. When PT-EAP is used, the Posture Transport Client in the NEA reference 
				model acts as an EAP peer (terminating the PT-EAP method on the endpoint) and 
				the Posture Transport Server acts as an EAP authenticator (terminating the PT-EAP
				method on the NEA Server).</t>
			<t>This section describes and defines the PT-EAP method. First, it provides a protocol 
				overview. Second, it describes specific features like version 
				negotiation. Third, it gives a detailed packet description. Finally, 
				it describes how the tls-unique channel binding <xref target="RFC5929"/> may be used to 
				bind PA-TNC exchanges to the EAP tunnel method, defeating MITM attacks such as 
				the Asokan attack <xref target="Asokan"/>. </t>
			<section title="Protocol Overview">
				<t> PT-EAP has two phases that follow each other in strict sequence: negotiation 
					and data transport.</t>
				<t> The PT-EAP method begins with the negotiation phase.  The NEA Server starts this 
					phase by sending a PT-EAP Start message: an EAP Request message of type PT-EAP 
					with the S (Start) flag set. The NEA Server also sets the Version field as described 
					in <xref target="Negotiation"/>. This is the only message in the negotiation
					phase. </t>
				<t>The data transport phase is the only phase of PT-EAP where PB-TNC batches are allowed 
					to be exchanged.  This phase always starts with the NEA Client sending a PB-TNC 
					batch to the NEA Server.  The NEA Client and NEA Server then take turns sending a PB-TNC batch.  The data transport phase always 
					ends with an EAP Response message from the NEA Client to the NEA Server.  The Data field of this message may have zero length if the NEA Server has just sent the last PB-TNC batch in the PB-TNC exchange.</t>
                <t> Note that the success of PT-EAP does not mean the overall authentication (using the outer EAP tunnel method) will succeed.  Neither does the failure of PT-EAP mean that the overall authentication will fail.  Success of the overall authentication depends on the policy configured by the administrator. </t>
				<t> At the end of the PT-EAP method, the NEA Server will indicate success or failure to 
					the EAP tunnel method.  Some EAP tunnel methods may provide explicit confirmation of 
					inner method success; others may not.  This is out of scope for the PT-EAP method specification.
					Successful completion of PT-EAP does not imply successful completion of the overall
					authentication nor does PT-EAP failure imply overall failure. This depends on the 
					administrative policy in place.</t>
				<t> The NEA Server and NEA Client may engage in an abnormal termination of the PT-EAP 
					exchange at any time by simply stopping the exchange. This may also require terminating 
					the EAP tunnel method, depending on the capabilities of the EAP tunnel method. </t>
			</section>
			<section anchor="Negotiation" title="Version Negotiation">
				<t> PT-EAP version negotiation takes place in the first PT-EAP message sent by the 
					NEA Server (the Start message) and the first PT-EAP message sent by the NEA Client 
					(the response to the Start message). The NEA Server MUST set the Version field in the 
					Start message to the maximum PT-EAP version that the NEA Server supports and is 
					willing to accept.</t>
				<t> The NEA Client chooses the PT-EAP version to be used for the exchange and places
					this value in the Version field in its response to the Start message. The NEA Client 
					SHOULD choose the value sent by the NEA Server if the NEA Client supports it. However, 
					the NEA Client MAY set the Version field to a value less than the value sent by the 
					NEA Server (for example, if the NEA Client only supports lesser PT-EAP versions). 
					If the NEA Client only supports PT-EAP versions greater than the value sent by 
					the NEA Server, the NEA Client MUST abnormally terminate the EAP negotiation.</t>
				<t>If the version sent by the NEA Client is not acceptable to the NEA Server, the NEA 
					Server MUST terminate the PT-EAP session immediately.  Otherwise, the version 
					sent by the NEA Client is the version of PT-EAP that MUST be used. Both the NEA 
					Client and the NEA Server MUST set the Version field to the chosen version number 
					in all subsequent PT-EAP messages in this exchange.</t>
				<t>This specification defines version 1 of PT-EAP.  Version 0 is reserved and MUST 
					never be sent. New versions of PT-EAP (values 2-7) may be defined by Standards 
					Action, as defined in <xref target="RFC5226"/>.</t>
			</section>
			
			<section anchor="MsgFmt" title="PT-EAP Message Format">
				<t> This section provides a detailed description of the fields in a PT-EAP message. 
					For a description of the diagram conventions used here, see
					<xref target="Conventions"/>.  Since PT-EAP is an EAP method, the first four 
					fields (e.g. Code, Identifier, Length and Type as shown in Figure 1) in each message are mandated by and defined in EAP. The other fields, e.g. Flags, Version and Data are specific to PT-EAP.</t>

			<section anchor="MIM" title="Preventing MITM Attacks with Channel Bindings">
				<t> As described in the NEA Asokan Attack Analysis <xref target="I-D.ietf-nea-asokan"/>, a sophisticated MITM attack can 
					be mounted against NEA systems.  The attacker forwards PA-TNC messages from a healthy 
					machine through an unhealthy one so that the unhealthy machine can gain network access.  
					Because there are easier attacks on NEA systems, like having the unhealthy machine lie
					about its configuration, this attack is generally only mounted against machines with 
					an External Measurement Agent (EMA). The EMA is a separate entity, difficult to compromise,
					which measures and attests to the configuration of the endpoint. </t>
				<t>To protect against NEA Asokan attacks, it is necessary for the Posture Broker on an 
					EMA-equipped endpoint to pass the tls-unique channel binding <xref target="RFC5929"/> from PT-EAP's 
					tunnel method to the EMA.  
                    This value can then be included in the EMA's attestation so that the Posture Validator 
                    responsible may then confirm that the value matches the 
                    tls-unique channel binding for its end of the tunnel. 
                    If the tls-unique values of the NEA Client and NEA Server match and this is confirmed by the EMA, then
                    the posture sent by a trustworthy EMA (and thus the NEA Client) is from the same endpoint as 
                    the client side of the TLS connection 
                    (since the endpoint knows the tls-unique value) so no man-in-the-middle is forwarding posture. 
                    If they differ, an attack has been detected and the Posture Validator SHOULD fail its 
                    verification. </t>
                <t> Note that tls-unique, as opposed to invoking a mutual cryptographic binding, is used as there is no
                    keying material being generated by PT-EAP (the method is defined to facilitate the transport of
                    posture data and is not an authentication method).  However, the NEA Client may host an EMA
                    which can be used as the means to cryptographically bind the tls-unique content that may be
                    validated by the Posture Validator interfacing with the EAP Server.  The binding of the tls-unique to the client authentication prevents the client's message from being used in another context.   This prevents a poorly configured client from unintentionally compromising the NEA system. Strong mutual authentication of the NEA server and client is still REQUIRED to prevent the disclosure of possibly sensitive NEA client information to an attacker.</t>

		<section anchor="Considerations" title="Security Considerations">
			<t>This section discusses the major threats and countermeasures provided by PT-EAP. 
                As discussed throughout the document, the PT-EAP method is designed to run 
                inside an EAP tunnel method which is capable of protecting the PT-EAP protocol from many
                threats. Since the EAP tunnel method will be specified separately, this section describes
                the considerations on the EAP tunnel method but does not evaluate its ability 
                to meet those requirements. The security considerations and requirements for NEA
                can be found in <xref target="RFC5209" />.
            </t>
			<section anchor="Trust" title="Trust Relationships">
				<t>In order to understand where security countermeasures are necessary,
					this section starts with a discussion of where the NEA architecture
					envisions some trust relationships between the processing elements

			<section title="Threats and Countermeasures">
				<t> Beyond the trusted relationships assumed in <xref target="Trust"/>, the PT-EAP EAP method
					faces a number of potential security attacks that could require security countermeasures.</t>
				<t>Generally, the PT protocol is responsible for providing strong security protections for
					all of the NEA protocols so any threats to PT's ability to protect NEA protocol messages
					could be very damaging to deployments.  For the PT-EAP method, most of the cryptographic
					security is provided by the outer EAP tunnel method and PT-EAP is encapsulated within 
					the protected tunnel.   Therefore, this section highlights the cryptographic requirements 
					that need to be met by the EAP tunnel method carrying PT-EAP in order to meet the NEA PT 
					requirements.  </t>
				<t> Once the message is delivered to the Posture Broker Client or Posture Broker Server, 
					the posture brokers are trusted to properly safely process the messages.</t> 
                <section anchor="theft" title="Message Confidentiality">
                        <t>When PT-EAP messages are sent over unprotected network links or spanning local 
                            software stacks that are not trusted, the contents of the messages may be subject
                            to information theft by an intermediary party.  This theft could result in information
                            being recorded for future use or analysis by an adversary.  Messages observed by 
                            eavesdroppers could contain information that exposes potential weaknesses in the 
                            security of the endpoint, or system fingerprinting information easing the ability
                            of the attacker to employ attacks more likely to be successful against the endpoint. 
                            The eavesdropper might also learn information about the endpoint or network policies 
                            that either singularly or collectively is considered sensitive information.  
                            For example, if PT-EAP is carried by an EAP tunnel method that does not provide 
                            confidentiality protection, an adversary could observe the PA-TNC attributes 
                            included in the PB-TNC batch and determine that the endpoint is lacking patches,
                            or particular sub-networks have more lenient policies.</t>
                        <t>In order to protect against NEA assessment message theft, the EAP tunnel method 
                            carrying PT-EAP must provide strong cryptographic authentication, integrity 
                            and confidentiality protection.  The use of bi-directional authentication in the 
                            EAP tunnel method carrying PT-EAP ensures that only properly authenticated and 
                            authorized parties may be involved in an assessment message exchange.  When 
                            PT-EAP is carried within a cryptographically protected EAP tunnel method like 
                            EAP-FAST or EAP-TTLS, all of the PB-TNC and PA-TNC protocol messages contents are hidden 
                            from potential theft by intermediaries lurking on the network.</t>
                    </section>
            <section title="Message Fabrication">
					<t> Attackers on the network or present within the NEA system could introduce fabricated 
						PT-EAP messages intending to trick or create a denial of service against aspects of an assessment. 
						For example, an adversary could attempt to 
                        insert a PT-EAP message to
                        tell a NEA Server that the endpoint is totally infected.
                        This could cause the device to be blocked from accessing
                        a critical resource, which would be a denial of service.
                        </t>
					<t>The EAP tunnel method carrying a PT-EAP method needs to provide strong security 
						protections for the complete message exchange over the network.  These security 
						protections prevent an intermediary from being able to insert fake messages into 
						the assessment. See <xref target="Reqmts"/> for more details on the EAP tunnel requirements.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="Message Modification">
					<t> This attack could allow an active attacker capable of intercepting a message to modify
						a PT-EAP message or transported PA-TNC attribute to a desired value to ease the 
						compromise of an endpoint.  Without the ability for message recipients to detect 
						whether a received message contains the same content as what was originally sent, 
						active attackers can stealthily modify the attribute exchange.</t>
					<t>PT-EAP leverages the EAP tunnel method (e.g. TEAP, EAP-FAST or EAP-TTLS) to provide strong 
						authentication and integrity protections as a countermeasure to this threat.  The 
						bi-directional authentication prevents the attacker from acting as an active 
						man-in-the-middle to the protocol that could be used to modify the message exchange.  
						The strong integrity protections offered by the TLS-based EAP tunnel method allows the PT-EAP 
						message recipients to detect message alterations by other types of network based
						adversaries.  Because PT-EAP does not itself provide explicit integrity protection
						for the PT-EAP payload, an EAP tunnel method that offers strong integrity protection
						is needed to mitigate this threat.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="Denial of Service">
					<t>A variety of types of denial of service attacks are possible against PT-EAP 
						if the message exchange is left unprotected while traveling over the network.  
						The Posture Transport Client and Posture Transport Server are trusted not to 
						participate in the denial of service of the assessment session, leaving the 
						threats to come from the network.</t>
					<t> The PT-EAP method primarily relies on the outer EAP tunnel method to provide
						strong authentication (at least of one party) and deployers are expected to leverage 
						other EAP methods to authenticate the other party (typically the client) within 
						the protected tunnel.  The use of a protected bi-directional authentication will
						prevent unauthorized parties from participating in a PT-EAP exchange.  </t>
					<t>After the cryptographic authentication by the EAP tunnel method, the session can be protected cryptographically to provide confidentiality
                        and source authenticity. Such protection prevents undetected
                        modification that could create a denial of service situation. However it is possible for an adversary to alter the 
						message flows causing each message to be rejected by the recipient because it fails 
						the integrity checking.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="NEA Asokan Attacks">
					<t>As described in <xref target="MIM"/> and in the NEA Asokan Attack Analysis 
						<xref target="I-D.ietf-nea-asokan"/>, a sophisticated MITM attack can be mounted against 
						NEA systems.  The attacker forwards PA-TNC messages from a healthy machine 
						through an unhealthy one so that the unhealthy machine can gain network access. 
						<xref target="MIM"/> and the NEA Asokan Attack Analysis provide a detailed 
						description of this attack and of the countermeasures that can be employed against it.</t>
					<t> Because lying endpoint attacks are much easier than Asokan attacks and an
						effective countermeasure against lying endpoint attacks is the use 
						of an External Measurement Agent (EMA), countermeasures against an Asokan 
						attack are not necessary unless an EMA is in use. However, PT-EAP implementers
						may not know whether an EMA will be used with their implementation. Therefore, 
						PT-EAP implementers SHOULD support these countermeasures by providing the value 
						of the tls-unique channel binding to higher layers in the NEA reference model: 
						Posture Broker Clients, Posture Broker Servers, Posture Collectors, and Posture 
						Validators. If the tls-unique channel binding is implemented,it must be verified before any other attestations are evaluated. </t>
				</section>
			</section>
            <section title="Candidate EAP Tunnel Method Protections">
				<t>This section discusses how PT-EAP is used within various EAP tunnel methods to meet 
					the PT requirements from <xref target="Reqmts"/>.  </t>
				<t>TEAP <xref target="I-D.ietf-emu-eap-tunnel-method"/>, EAP-FAST <xref target="RFC4851" /> and EAP-TTLS <xref target="RFC5281" /> make use of TLS <xref target="RFC5246"/> to protect the 
					transport of information between the NEA Client and NEA Server.  Each of these 
					EAP tunnel methods has two phases. In the first phase, a TLS tunnel is established
					between NEA Client and NEA Server. In the second phase, the tunnel is used to 
					pass other information.  PT-EAP requires that establishing this tunnel include at 
					least an authentication of the NEA Server by the NEA Client.</t>
				<t>The phase two dialog may include authentication of the user by doing other EAP 
					methods or in the case of EAP-TTLS by using EAP or non-EAP authentication dialogs.  
					PT-EAP is also carried by the phase two tunnel allowing the NEA assessment to 
					be within an encrypted and integrity protected transport.</t>
				<t>With all these methods (e.g. TEAP <xref target="I-D.ietf-emu-eap-tunnel-method"/>, 
				        EAP-FAST <xref target="RFC4851"/> and EAP-TTLS <xref target="RFC5281"/>),
					a cryptographic key is derived from the authentication 
					that may be used to secure later transmissions.  Each of these methods employs
					at least a NEA Server authentication using an X.509 certificate.  Within each 
					EAP tunnel method will exist a set of inner EAP methods.  These inner methods may 
					perform additional security handshakes including more granular authentications 
					or exchanges of integrity information (such as PT-EAP.)  At some point after 
					the conclusion of each inner EAP method, some of the methods will export the 
					established secret keys to the outer tunnel method.  It's expected that the 
					outer method will cryptographically mix these keys into any keys it is currently
					using to protect the session and perform a final operation to determine whether
					both parties have arrived at the same mixed key.  This cryptographic binding of 
					the inner method results to the outer method's keys is essential for detection of 
					conventional (non-NEA) Asokan attacks. </t>
                <t>TEAP <xref target="I-D.ietf-emu-eap-tunnel-method"/> is the mandatory to implement EAP tunnel method.</t>

        <section anchor="Reqmts" title="Requirements for EAP Tunnel Methods">
                <t>Because the PT-EAP inner method described in this specification relies on the outer
                    EAP tunnel method for a majority of its security protections, this section 
                    reiterates the PT requirements that MUST be met by the IETF standard EAP tunnel 
                    method for use with PT-EAP.</t>
                
                <t> At the time of this writing, 
                    the IETF EAP Method Update (EMU) working group is working on 
                    standardizing on TEAP <xref target="I-D.ietf-emu-eap-tunnel-method"/> as a Standards Track EAP 
                    tunnel method that will satisfy NEA's requirements and is the mandatory to implement EAP tunnel method. </t>
                
                <t>The security requirements described in this specification MUST be implemented in 
                    any product claiming to be PT-EAP compliant.  The decision of whether a particular 
                    deployment chooses to use these protections is a deployment issue.  A customer
                    may choose to avoid potential deployment issues or performance penalties 
                    associated with the use of cryptography when the required protection has been 
                    achieved through other mechanisms (e.g. physical isolation).  If security 
                    mechanisms may be deactivated by policy, an implementation SHOULD offer an 
                    interface to query how a message will be (or was) protected by PT so higher 
                    layer NEA protocols can factor this into their decisions.</t>
                <t><xref target="RFC5209">RFC 5209</xref> includes the following requirement that is to be applied during the 
                    selection of the EAP tunnel method(s) used in conjunction with PT-EAP:</t>
                <t>
                    <list hangIndent="0" style="hanging">
                        <t>PT-2: The PT protocol MUST be capable of supporting mutual authentication, 
                            integrity, confidentiality, and replay protection of the PB messages 
                            between the Posture Transport Client and the Posture Transport Server.</t>
                    </list>
                </t>
                <t>Note that mutual authentication could be achieved by a combination of a strong
                    authentication of one party (e.g. server authentication while establishing the
                    TLS-based tunnel) by the EAP
                    tunnel method in conjunction with a second authentication of the other party 
                    (e.g. client authentication inside the protected tunnel) by another EAP method
                    running prior to PT-EAP.</t>
                <t> Having the Posture Transport Client always authenticate the Posture Transport Server 
                    provides assurance to the NEA Client that the NEA Server is authentic (not a rogue 
                    or MiTM) prior to disclosing secret or potentially privacy sensitive information 
                    about what is running or configured on the endpoint.  However the NEA Server's
                    policy may allow for the delay of the authentication of the NEA Client until a
                    suitable protected channel has been established allowing for non-cryptographic 
                    NEA Client credentials (e.g. username/password) to be used.  Whether the 
                    communication channel is established with mutual or server-side only authentication,
                    the resulting channel needs to provide strong 
                    integrity and confidentiality protection to its contents.  These protections 
                    are to be bound to at least the authentication of the NEA Server by the NEA Client, 
                    so the session
                    is cryptographically bound to a particular authentication event.</t>
                <t> The EAP tunnel method 
                        carrying PT-EAP MUST provide strong cryptographic authentication, integrity 
                        and confidentiality protection to protect against NEA assessment message theft as described in <xref target="theft"/>.  The cryptographically protected EAP tunnel ensures
                    that all of the PA-TNC and PB-TNC protocol messages are hidden from intermediaries 
                    wanting to steal NEA data. </t>
                <t>To support countermeasures against NEA Asokan attacks as described in
                    <xref target="MIM"/>, the EAP Tunnel Method used with PT-EAP will need to 
                    support generation of the tls-unique value to be used with the higher layers of the NEA reference model. This should not be a high bar since all
                    EAP tunnel methods currently support this but not all implementations of those methods
                    may do so.</t>
            </section>
            
		<section title="Privacy Considerations">
			<t>The role of PT-EAP is to act as a secure transport for PB-TNC over a network before
				the endpoint has been admitted to the network.  As a transport protocol, PT-EAP 
				does not directly utilize or require direct knowledge of any personally identifiable 
				information (PII).  PT-EAP will typically be used in conjunction with other EAP 
				methods that provide for the user authentication (if bi-directional authentication is 
				used), so the user's credentials are not directly seen by the PT-EAP inner method.  
				</t>
			<t>While PT-EAP does not provide cryptographic protection for the PB-TNC batches, it is
				designed to operate within an EAP tunnel method that provides strong authentication, 
				integrity and confidentiality services.  Therefore, it is important for deployers to

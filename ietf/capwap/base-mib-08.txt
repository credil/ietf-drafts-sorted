Internet-Draft          CAPWAP Protocol Base MIB            January 2010


1.  Introduction

   The CAPWAP Protocol [RFC5415] defines a standard, interoperable
   protocol, which enables an Access Controller (AC) to manage a
   collection of Wireless Termination Points(WTPs).

   This document defines a MIB module that can be used to manage the
   CAPWAP implementations.  This MIB module covers both configuration
   and WTP status-monitoring aspects of CAPWAP, and provides a way to
   reuse MIB modules for any wireless technology.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the CAPWAP Protocol specification
   [RFC5415] and the Architecture Taxonomy for CAPWAP [RFC4118].

   Access Controller (AC): The network entity that provides WTP access
   to the network infrastructure in the data plane, control plane,
   management plane, or a combination therein.

   Wireless Termination Point (WTP): The physical or network entity that
   contains an RF antenna and wireless physical layer (PHY) to transmit
   and receive station traffic for wireless access networks.

   Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP): It is a
   generic protocol defining AC and WTP control and data plane
   communication via a CAPWAP protocol transport mechanism.  CAPWAP
   control messages, and optionally CAPWAP data messages, are secured
   using Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [RFC4347].

   CAPWAP Control Channel: A bi-directional flow defined by the AC IP
   Address, WTP IP Address, AC control port, WTP control port and the
   transport-layer protocol (UDP or UDP-Lite) over which CAPWAP control

Internet-Draft          CAPWAP Protocol Base MIB            January 2010


   packets are sent and received.

   CAPWAP Data Channel: A bi-directional flow defined by the AC IP
   Address, WTP IP Address, AC data port, WTP data port, and the
   transport-layer protocol (UDP or UDP-Lite) over which CAPWAP data
   packets are sent and received.

   Station (STA): A device that contains an interface to a wireless
   medium (WM).

   Split and Local MAC: The CAPWAP protocol supports two modes of
   operation: Split and Local MAC.  In Split MAC mode all L2 wireless
   data and management frames are encapsulated via the CAPWAP protocol
   and exchanged between the AC and the WTPs.  The Local MAC mode allows
   the data frames to be either locally bridged, or tunneled as 802.3
   frames.

   Wireless Binding: The CAPWAP protocol is independent of a specific
   WTP radio technology, as well its associated wireless link layer
   protocol.  Elements of the CAPWAP protocol are designed to
   accommodate the specific needs of each wireless technology in a
   standard way.  Implementation of the CAPWAP protocol for a particular
   wireless technology MUST define a binding protocol for it, e.g., the
   binding for IEEE 802.11, provided in [RFC5416].

   Autonomous Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Architecture: It is the
   traditional autonomous WLAN architecture, in which each WTP is a
   single physical device that implements all the wireless services.

   Centralized WLAN Architecture: It is an emerging hierarchical
   architecture utilizing one or more centralized controllers for
   managing a large number of WTP devices.  It can be said that the full
   wireless functions are implemented across multiple physical network
   devices, namely, the WTPs and ACs.

4.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

5.  Overview

5.1.  Requirements and Constraints

   The CAPWAP Protocol MIB module (CAPWAP-BASE-MIB) is designed to:

   - Support centralized management and monitoring of WTPs from the AC



Shi, et al.               Expires July 15, 2010                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          CAPWAP Protocol Base MIB            January 2010


   in combination with the CAPWAP protocol;

   - Allow operators to make configurations for WTPs before and after
   they connect to the AC;

   - Support querying of CAPWAP protocol parameters;

   - Support displaying of WTPs' current state and configuration;

   - Provide basic property information about the AC, WTP, radio and
   station and their relationships;

   - Provide counters for events on WTPs and radios such as reboot and
   hardware failure;

   - Provide various notifications such as channel up and join failure.

5.2.  Wireless Binding MIB Modules

   Other Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs), such as IEEE, have
   already defined MIB modules for a specific wireless technology, e.g.,
   IEEE 802.11 MIB module [IEEE.802-11.2007].  Such MIB modules are
   called wireless binding MIB modules.

5.3.  Design Objectives

   This document introduces a mechanism to avoid redefining MIB objects
   in the existing MIB modules for a specific wireless technology, in
   other words, a mechanism to reuse wireless binding MIB modules
   defined by other SDOs.

   In summary, the CAPWAP-BASE-MIB module has the following design
   objectives:

   - To implement an architecture that uses SNMP for the management and
   control of wireless networks, and answering the operator's
   requirements for centralized management, whatever the wireless
   devices are configured and deployed (centralized, autonomous, or some
   mix);

   - To be consistent with the CAPWAP protocol;

   - To be independent of any wireless technologies and be able to reuse
   wireless binding MIB modules defined by other SDOs;

   - To enable interoperability between vendors;

   - To meet the management requirements for the centralized WLAN

Internet-Draft          CAPWAP Protocol Base MIB            January 2010


   architecture.

5.4.  Design Idea

   The basic design idea of the CAPWAP-BASE-MIB module is:

   - The SNMP agent MUST be run on the AC devices and is not REQUIRED on
   the WTP devices.  It follows the same model as the CAPWAP protocol:
   Centralized Control;

   - It is designed to accommodate the specific needs of each wireless
   technology in a standard way.  It is independent of any wireless
   technologies;

   - The ifIndex [RFC2863] is used as a common index for corresponding
   interfaces in the CAPWAP-BASE-MIB and the MIB modules of specific
   wireless technologies;

   - The operator could manage and control the centralized WLAN
   architectures using multiple MIB modules defined by multiple SDOs,
   while keeping them loosely coupled.

5.5.  Mechanism of Reusing Wireless Binding MIB Modules

   For any wireless technology, the configuration and management of
   radios are very important.  As usual, wireless binding MIB modules
   support radio management on their own.  For example, the MIB tables
   such as the Dot11OperationTable [IEEE.802-11.2007] are able to
   support WTP radio configuration.  These tables use the ifIndex as the
   index, and work well under autonomous WLAN architecture.

   To reuse such wireless binding MIB modules is very important to
   centralized WLAN architectures.  According to [RFC5415], a specific
   PHY radio could be identified by the combination of the identifiers
   of the WTP and radio (WTP ID + radio ID), so the key point is to make
   use of the ifIndex idea and find a way to maintain the mappings
   between 'WTP ID + radio ID' and the ifIndex.  As a generic mechanism,
   an ifIndex can identify an interface in an abstract way, and it does
   NOT care for the interface's PHY location (either on the WTP or AC).
   The AC can have WTP Virtual Radio Interfaces to logically represent
   PHY radios on the WTP.  It looks like that PHY radios are located on
   the AC, and PHY location of the WTP (radio) is hidden to the
   operator.  The operator can operate radios through MIB tables with
   the ifIndex of a WTP Virtual Radio Interface.  As a type of abstract
   interface, the WTP Virtual Radio Interface could be used by any
   wireless technology such as IEEE 802.11 and 802.16.  The
   capwapBaseWirelessBindingTable in the CAPWAP-BASE-MIB module is used
   to store the mappings between the 'WTP ID+ Radio ID' and the ifIndex.

Internet-Draft          CAPWAP Protocol Base MIB            January 2010


5.6.  CAPWAP Protocol Wireless Binding MIB Module

   According to the CAPWAP Protocol specification [RFC5415], when
   defining a binding for wireless technologies, the authors MUST
   include any necessary definitions for technology-specific messages
   and all technology-specific message elements for those messages.  A
   CAPWAP binding protocol is required for a specific wireless binding
   technology, e.g., the protocol of [RFC5416] for IEEE 802.11 binding.

   Sometimes, not all the technology-specific message elements in a
   CAPWAP binding protocol have MIB objects defined by other SDOs.  For
   example, the protocol of [RFC5416] defines WLAN management.  The WLAN
   refers to a logical component instantiated on a WTP device.  A single
   physical WTP MAY operate a number of WLANs.  Also, Local or Split MAC
   modes could be specified for a WLAN.  The MAC mode for a WLAN is not
   in the scope of IEEE 802.11 [IEEE.802-11.2007].  In such cases, in
   addition to the existing wireless binding MIB modules defined by
   other SDOs, a CAPWAP protocol wireless binding MIB module is required
   to be defined for a wireless binding, e.g, the CAPWAP Protocol
   Binding MIB for IEEE 802.11 [I-D.ietf-capwap-802dot11-mib].

5.7.  WTP Profile

   In a centralized WLAN architecture, a WTP profile is used to make
   configurations such as static IP address for a WTP before and after
   it connects to the AC.  It MUST contain the Base MAC address
   [RFC5415] of the WTP because the CAPWAP message received from the WTP
   contains the Base MAC address and the AC uses this Base MAC address
   to find the corresponding WTP profile.

   In the section 4.6.40 [RFC5415], it omits indicating that the WTP's
   Base MAC address MUST be included in the WTP Board Data message
   element.  It is a known errata item and assumed to be fixed in future
   by the editors of the RFC5415.

   Another important function of WTP profile is to trigger the creation
   of WTP Virtual Radio Interfaces on the AC.  To implement this
   function, a WTP profile MUST include the WTP's model number
   [RFC5415], which reflects the number of PHY radios on the WTP.  In
   this way, the creation of a WTP profile triggers the AC to
   automatically create the same number of WTP Virtual Radio Interfaces
   corresponding to the WTP's PHY radios without manual intervention.
   With the ifIndexes of WTP Virtual Radio Interfaces, the operator
   could configure and manage the WTP's PHY radios through the wireless
   binding MIB modules.

6.  Structure of the MIB Module

   The MIB objects are derived from the CAPWAP protocol document
   [RFC5415].

   1) capwapBaseAcNameListTable

   The AC name list table is used to configure the AC name list.

   2) capwapBaseMacAclTable

   The ACL table is used to configure stations' Access Control
   List(ACL).

   3) capwapBaseWtpProfileTable

   The WTP profile table is used to configure WTP profiles for WTPs to
   be managed before they connect to the AC.  An operator could change a
   WTP's current configuration by changing the values of parameters in
   the corresponding WTP profile, then the WTP could get the new
   configuration through the CAPWAP control channel.

   4) capwapBaseWtpStateTable

   The WTPs status table is used to indicate each WTP's CAPWAP FSM
   state, and helps operator to query WTPs' current configuration.

   5) capwapBaseWtpTable

   The WTPs table is used display properties of WTPs in running state.

   6) capwapBaseWirelessBindingTable

   The wireless binding table is used to display the mappings between
   WTP Virtual Radio Interfaces and PHY radios, and the wireless binding
   type for each PHY radio.

   7) capwapBaseStationTable

   The station table is used for providing stations' basic property
   information.

   8) capwapBaseWtpEventsStatsTable

   The WTP events statistic table is used for collecting WTP reboot
   count, link failure count, hardware failure count and so on.

   9) capwapBaseRadioEventsStatsTable

Internet-Draft          CAPWAP Protocol Base MIB            January 2010


   The radio events statistic table is used for collecting radio reset
   count, channel change count, hardware failure count and so on.

7.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

7.1.  Relationship to SNMPv2-MIB Module

   The CAPWAP-BASE-MIB module does not duplicate the objects of the
   'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] that is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.

7.2.  Relationship to IF-MIB Module

   The Interfaces Group [RFC2863] defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces.  This memo contains the media-specific
   extensions to the Interfaces Group for managing WTP PHY radios that
   are modeled as interfaces.

   The IF-MIB module is required to be supported on the AC.  Each PHY
   radio on the WTP corresponds to a WTP Virtual Radio Interface on the
   AC.  The WTP Virtual Radio Interface provides a way to configure the
   radio's parameters and query radio's traffic statistics, and reuse
   wireless binding modules defined by other SDOs.  The interface MUST
   be modeled as an ifEntry, and ifEntry objects such as ifIndex,
   ifDescr, ifName, ifAlias are to be used as per [RFC2863].

   Also, as an ifIndex [RFC2863] is used as a common index for a
   corresponding interfaces in the CAPWAP-BASE-MIB and specific wireless
   technologies MIB modules, the AC MUST have a mechanism that preserves
   the values of the ifIndexes in the ifTable at AC reboot.

7.3.  Relationship to ENTITY-MIB Module

   The ENTITY-MIB module [RFC4133] meets the need for a standardized way
   of representing a single agent, which supports multiple instances of
   one MIB.  It could express a certain relationship between multiple
   entities, and provide entity properties for each entity.

   In a centralized WLAN architecture, the SNMP agent runs on the AC,
   and is not required on the WTP.  With the ENTITY-MIB module on the
   AC, it could keep entity information such as firmware revision and
   software revision of the AC and WTPs.  From the ENTITY-MIB module's
   perspective, the overall physical entity (AC) is a 'compound' of
   multiple physical entities (that is, the WTPs connected to AC), and
   all entities are each identified by a Physical index.  The
   capwapBaseWtpTable of the CAPWAP-BASE-MIB module uses the

   capwapBaseWtpPhyIndex object to store the mappings of WTP object
   between CAPWAP-BASE-MIB and ENTITY-MIB modules.

   By querying both the CAPWAP-BASE-MIB and ENTITY-MIB modules,
   operators could query the status and properties of the AC and WTPs.
   For example, they could get a WTP's current status through the
   CAPWAP-BASE-MIB module, and a WTP's software revision information
   through the ENTITY-MIB module.  The CAPWAP-BASE-MIB module does not
   duplicate those objects defined in the ENTITY-MIB module.

7.4.  Relationship to Wireless Binding MIB Modules

   The wireless binding MIB module of a wireless technology (such as
   [IEEE.802-11.2007]) is required to be supported on the AC.  The
   CAPWAP-BASE-MIB module is able to support any wireless binding.
   Through the ifIndexes of WTP Virtual Radio Interfaces, it provides a
   consistent and abstract way of reusing MIB objects in the wireless
   binding MIB modules.  The CAPWAP-BASE-MIB module does not duplicate
   those objects defined in the wireless binding MIB modules.

7.5.  MIB Modules Required for IMPORTS

   The following MIB module IMPORTS objects from SYSAPPL-MIB [RFC2287],
   SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IF-
   MIB [RFC2863], SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB [RFC3411], INET-ADDRESS-MIB
   [RFC4001] and ENTITY-MIB [RFC4133].

8.  Example of CAPWAP-BASE-MIB Module Usage

   Here takes IEEE 802.11 binding as an example to show how the MIB
   modules operate.

   1) Create a WTP profile

   Suppose the WTP's Base MAC address is '00:01:01:01:01:00'.  Create
   the WTP profile as follows:

   Suppose the WTP with model number 'WTP123' has one PHY radio and this
   PHY radio is identified by ID 1.  The creation of this WTP profile
   triggers the AC to automatically create a WTP Virtual Radio Interface
   and add a new row object to the CapwapBaseWirelessBindingTable
   without manual intervention.  Suppose the ifIndex of the WTP Virtual
   Radio Interface is 10.  The following information is stored in the
   CapwapBaseWirelessBindingTable.

      In CapwapBaseWirelessBindingTable
      {
        capwapBaseWtpProfileId                          = 1,
        capwapBaseWirelessBindingRadioId                = 1,
        capwapBaseWirelessBindingVirtualRadioIfIndex    = 10,
        capwapBaseWirelessBindingType                   = dot11(2)
      }

   The WTP Virtual Radio Interfaces on the AC correspond to the PHY
   radios on the WTP.  The WTP Virtual Radio Interface is modeled by
   ifTable [RFC2863].

        ifOutDiscards        = 0,
        ifOutErrors          = 0
       }

   2) Query the ifIndexes of WTP Virtual Radio Interfaces

   Before configuring PHY radios, the operator needs to get the
   ifIndexes of WTP Virtual Radio Interfaces corresponding to the PHY
   radios.

   As CapwapBaseWirelessBindingTable already stores the mappings between
   PHY radios (Radio IDs) and the ifIndexes of WTP Virtual Radio
   Interfaces, the operator can get the ifIndex information by querying
   this table.  Such a query operation SHOULD run from radio ID 1 to
   radio ID 31 according to [RFC5415]), and stop when a invalid ifIndex
   value (0) is returned.

   This example uses capwapBaseWtpProfileId = 1 and
   capwapBaseWirelessBindingRadioId = 1 as inputs to query the
   CapwapBaseWirelessBindingTable, and gets
   capwapBaseWirelessBindingVirtualRadioIfIndex = 10.  Then it uses
   capwapBaseWtpProfileId = 1 and capwapBaseWirelessBindingRadioId = 2,
   and gets a invalid ifIndex value (0), so the the query operation
   ends.  This method gets not only the ifIndexes of WTP Virtual Radio
   Interfaces, but also the numbers of PHY radios.  Besides checking
   whether the ifIndex value is valid, the operator SHOULD check whether
   the capwapBaseWirelessBindingType is the desired binding type.

Internet-Draft          CAPWAP Protocol Base MIB            January 2010


   3) Configure specific wireless binding parameters for a WTP Virtual
   Radio Interface

   This configuration is made on the AC through a specific wireless
   binding MIB module such as the IEEE 802.11 MIB module.

   The following shows an example of configuring parameters for a WTP
   Virtual Radio Interface with ifIndex 10 through the IEEE 802.11
   Dot11OperationTable [IEEE.802-11.2007].

      In Dot11OperationTable
      {
        ifIndex                         = 10,
        dot11MACAddress                 = '00:00:00:00:00:00',
        dot11RTSThreshold               = 2347,
        dot11ShortRetryLimit            = 7,
        dot11LongRetryLimit             = 4,
        dot11FragmentationThreshold     = 256,
        dot11MaxTransmitMSDULifetime    = 512,
        dot11MaxReceiveLifetime         = 512,
        dot11ManufacturerID             = 'capwap',
        dot11ProductID                  = 'capwap'
      }

   4) Current configuration status report from the WTP to the AC

   According to [RFC5415], before a WTP that has joined the AC gets
   configuration from the AC, it needs to report its current
   configuration status by sending a configuration status request
   message to the AC, which use the message to update MIB objects on the
   AC.  For example, for IEEE 802.11 binding, the AC updates data in the
   ifTable [RFC2863] and IEEE 802.11 MIB module so on according to the
   message.  For ifIndex 10, its ifOperStatus in ifTable is updated
   according to the current radio operational status in the CAPWAP
   message.

   5) Query WTP and radio statistics data

   After WTPs start to run, the operator could query WTP and radio
   statistics data through CAPWAP-BASE-MIB and specific binding MIB
   module on the AC.  For example, through dot11CountersTable in the
   IEEE 802.11 MIB module, the operator could query the counter data of
   a radio using the ifIndex of the corresponding WTP Virtual Radio
   Interface.  With the capwapBaseWtpTable table in the CAPWAP-BASE-MIB
   module, the operator could query the properties of running WTPs.

   6) MIB operations through a CAPWAP protocol wireless binding MIB
   module

Internet-Draft          CAPWAP Protocol Base MIB            January 2010


   For example, for CAPWAP IEEE 802.11 binding protocol [RFC5416], Some
   MIB operations such as MAC mode configuration for a WLAN depend on
   the CAPWAP Protocol Binding MIB for IEEE 802.11
   [I-D.ietf-capwap-802dot11-mib].  For more information, refer to
   [I-D.ietf-capwap-802dot11-mib].

   7) Query other properties of a WTP

   The Operator could query MIB objects in the ENTITY-MIB [RFC4133]
   module by using the capwapBaseWtpPhyIndex in the capwapBaseWtpTable
   of CAPWAP-BASE-MIB module.  The properties of a WTP such as software
   version, hardware version are available in the ENTITY-MIB module.

9.  CAPWAP Message Element Extension

   This section describes the CAPWAP control message extension for
   CAPWAP protocol to support CAPWAP-BASE-MIB module.

   To enable CAPWAP protocol timers and variables [RFC5415] manageable
   through CAPWAP protocol, the following capwap message element
   extensions are defined using Vendor Specific Payload message element
   in this section.  These message elements are used by WTP to report
   extra configuration information to the AC.

11.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects MAY be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  The followings are the tables and objects and
   their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   - Unauthorized changes to the capwapBaseWtProfileTable, and writable
   objects under capwapBaseAcs group MAY disrupt allocation of resources
   in the network.  For example, a WTP's static IP address could be
   changed by set capwapBaseWtpProfileWtpStaticIp object.

   - Unauthorized changes to writable objects under the capwapBaseAc
   group, it MAY disrupt allocation of resources in the network.  For
   example, a invalid value for capwapBaseWtpSessionsLimit object will
   increase the AC's traffic burden.  Also, some objects such as
   capwapBaseDataChannelDTLSPolicyConfig MAY cause network unsafe.

   - Unauthorized changes to the capwapBaseMacAclTable, it MAY cause
   legal stations unable to access the network any more while illegal
   stations have chance to access the network.

   - Unauthorized changes to writable objects under the
   capwapBaseParameters group, it MAY influence CAPWAP protocol
   behaviour and status.  For example, an invalid value set for the
   capwapBaseAcDataCheckTimer MAY influence the CAPWAP state machine.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) MAY be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  The followings are the tables and objects and
   their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   - The capwapBaseDataChannelDTLSPolicyOptions and
   capwapBaseControlChannelAuthenOptions under the capwapBaseAc group
   exposes the current security option for CAPWAP data and control
   channels.

   - The capwapBaseWtpTable exposes a WTP's important information like
   tunnel mode, MAC type and so on.

   - The capwapBaseWtpEventsStatsTable exposes a WTP's failure
   information.

   - The capwapBaseRadioEventsStatsTable exposes a radio's failure
   information.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, the deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

12.  IANA Considerations

12.1.  IANA Considerations for CAPWAP-BASE-MIB Module

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        capwapBaseMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

12.2.  IANA Considerations for ifType

   Require IANA to assign a ifType for the WTP Virtual Radio Interface.

13.  Contributors

   This MIB module is based on contributions from Long Gao.

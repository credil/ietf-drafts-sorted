        	<t>
        	Since cryptographic algorithms can become weak over the years,
        	it is necessary to evaluate their security suitability.
        	When signing or verifying data, or when encrypting or decrypting
        	data, these evaluations must be considered.  This document specifies
        	a data structure that enables an automated analysis of the security
        	suitability of a given cryptographic algorithm at a given point of
        	time which may be in the past, at the present time or in the future.

       <section title="Introduction">
       	       <section title="Motivation">
	       <t>
	       Digital signatures can provide data integrity and authentication.
	       They are based on cryptographic algorithms that are required to have certain security
	       properties. For example, hash algorithms must be resistant to collisions and in
	       case of public key algorithms computation of the private key that corresponds to a
	       given public key must be infeasible. If algorithms lack the required properties,
	       signatures could be forged, unless they are protected by a strong cryptographic algorithm.
	       </t>
	       <t>
	       Cryptographic algorithms that are used in signatures shall be selected to resist such attacks 
	       during their period of use. For signature keys included in public key certificates, it is the 
	       validity period of the certificate. Cryptographic algorithms that are used for encryption shall 
	       resist during the time during which it is planned to keep the information confidential.
	       </t>
	       <t>
	       Only very few algorithms satisfy the security requirements. Besides, because of the increasing performance
	       of computers and progresses in cryptography, algorithms or their parameters
	       become insecure over the years. The hash algorithm MD5, for example, is unsuitable today for many purposes.
	       A digital signature using a "weak" algorithm has no probative value, unless the "weak" algorithm has been
	       protected by a strong algorithm before the time it was considered to be weak.
	       Many kinds of digital signed data, including signed documents, time stamps,
	       certificates, and revocation lists, are affected, in particular in the case of long-term archiving.
	       Over long periods of time, it is assumed that the algorithms
	       used in signatures become insecure.
	       </t>
	       <t>
	       For this reason, it is important to periodically evaluate an algorithm's fitness and to consider 
	       the results of these evaluations when creating and verifying signatures, or when maintaining the validity
	       of signatures made in the past. One result is a projected validity period for the algorithm, i.e.,
	       a prediction of the period of time during which the algorithm is fit for use. This prediction can
	       help to detect whether a weak algorithm is used in a signature and whether that signature has been properly 
	       protected in due time by another signature made using an algorithm that is suitable at the present point of time.
	       Algorithm evaluations are made by expert committees. In Germany the Federal Network Agency annually publishes
	       evaluations of cryptographic algorithms <xref target='BNetzAg.2008' />. Examples of other European and
	       international evaluations are <xref target='ETSI-TS102176-1-2005' /> and <xref target='NIST.800-57-Part1.2006' />.
	       </t>
	       <t>
	       These evaluations are published in documents intended to be read by humans. Therefore it is necessary to define a
	       data structure that expresses the content of the evaluations to enable automated processing. 
	       This standardized data structure can be used for publication and can be interpreted by signature generation and verification tools.
	       Algorithm evaluations are pooled in a security suitability policy.
	       In this document a data structure for a security suitability policy is specified.
	       Therefore the document provides a framework for expressing evaluations of cryptographic algorithms.
	       This document does not attempt to catalog the security properties of cryptographic algorithms.
	       Furthermore no guidelines are made about which kind of algorithms shall be evaluated: 
	       For example, security suitability policies may be used to evaluate public key and hash algorithms, signature schemes, and encryption schemes.

       	       <t>
       	       In the following some use cases for a security suitability policy are presented.
       	       <list style="hanging">
       	            <t hangText="Long-term archiving:">
       	            The most important use case is long-term archiving
       	            of signed data. Algorithms or their parameters become insecure over
       	            long time periods. Therefore signatures of archived data and timestamps have to be periodically
       	            renewed.
       	            A policy provides information about suitable and threatened algorithms.
       	            Additionally the policy assists in verifying archived as well as re-signed documents.

       	            <t hangText="Services:">
       	            Services may provide information about cryptographic algorithms.
       	            On the basis of a policy a service is able to provide the date when an algorithm
       	            became insecure or presumably will become insecure or to provide all algorithms
       	            which are presently valid.
       	            Verification tools or long-term archiving systems can request such services and therefore do not need to deal 
       	            with the algorithm security by themselves.

       	            </t>

       	            <t hangText="Signing and verifying:">
       	            When signing documents, or certificates, it must be assured that the algorithms
       	            used for signing or verifying are suitable. Accordingly, when verifying
       	            CMS <xref target='RFC3852' /> or XML signatures
       	            <xref target="RFC3275" /> <xref target='ETSI-TS101903' />, not only the
       	            validity of the certificates may be checked but also the validity of the
       	            algorithms.
       	            </t>

       	            <t hangText="Re-encryption:">
       	            A security suitability policy can also be used to decide if encrypted documents
       	            must be re-encrypted because the encryption algorithm is no longer secure.
       	            </t>

       	concerning both the design and the usage of the data structure.
       	</t>
       	<t>
       	A policy contains a list of algorithms that have been evaluated by a publisher. An algorithm evaluation is described
	by its identifier, security constraints and validity period.
	By these constraints the requirements for algorithm properties must be defined,
	e.g. a public key algorithm is evaluated on the basis of its parameters.

	    The data structure of the policy must allow automated evaluation of the security suitability of an algorithm.
	       	</t>
	       	<t hangText="Flexibility:">
		The data structure must be flexible enough to support new algorithms.

		<t>
		It is assumed that a policy contains the evaluations of all currently known algorithms,

		An algorithm is suitable at a time of interest if it is contained in the current policy and 
		the time of interest is within the validity period.
		Additionally, if the algorithm has any parameters, these parameters must meet the requirements defined in the
		security constraints.
		</t>
	       	<t>
		If an algorithm appears in a policy for the first time,
		it may be assumed that the algorithm has already been suitable in the past.
		Generally, algorithms are used in practice prior to evaluation.
		</t>
		<t>
		To avoid inconsistencies, multiple instances of the same algorithm are prohibited. 
		The publisher must take care about preventing conflicts within a policy.
		</t>
	       	<t>
		Assertions made in the policy are suitable at least until the next policy is published.
		</t>
	       	<t>
		Publishers may extend the lifetime of an algorithm prior to reaching the end of the algorithm's
		validity period by publishing a revised policy. Publishers should not resurrect algorithms that are
		expired at the time a revised policy is published.

       		which SHOULD be used.
       		For the actual parameter, a range of values or an exact value may be defined.
       		These constraints are expressed by the following elements:
       		<list style="hanging">
	       	<t hangText="Min:">
	       	The Min element defines the minimum value of the parameter.

	       	A range MAY also be specified by a combination of both elements,

	       	The parameter may have any value within the defined range, 
	       	including the minimum and maximum values.
	       	An exact value is expressed by using the same value in both the

        <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="secCons">
        <t>The policy for algorithm's security suitability has great impact on the quality
        of the results of signature generation and verification operations. If an algorithm is incorrectly 
        evaluated against a policy,
        signatures with a low probative force could be created or verification results
        could be incorrect. The following security considerations have been identified:
        <list style="numbers">
        <t>
        Publishers MUST ensure unauthorized manipulation of any security suitability is not possible prior to a policy being
        signed and published. There is no mechanism provided to revoke a policy after publication.
        Since the algorithm evaluations change infrequently, the lifespan of a policy should be carefully considered prior
        to publication.
        </t>
        <t>
        Operators SHOULD only accept policies issued by a trusted publisher.
        Furthermore, the validity of the certificate used to sign the policy SHOULD be verifiable by CRL <xref target="RFC5280" /> or OCSP <xref target="RFC2560" />. 
        The certificate used to sign the policy SHOULD be revoked if the algorithms used in this certificate are not longer suitable.
        It MUST NOT be possible to alter or replace a policy once
        accepted by an operator.
        </t>
        <t>
        Operators SHOULD periodically check to see if a new policy has been published to avoid using obsolete policy information.
        For publishers it is suggested not to omit the NextUpdate element in order to give operators a hint, when the next policy
        will be published.
        </t>
        <t>
        When signing a policy, algorithms SHOULD be used which are suitable according this policy.
        </t>
        <t>
        The processing rule described in <xref target="processing"/> is about one cryptographic algorithm independently of the use case.
        Depending upon the use case, an algorithm that is no more suitable at the time of interest, does not necessarily mean
        that the data structure where it is used is no more secure. For example, a signature has been made with an RSA signer's key of 1024 bits.
        This signature is time-stamped with a time-stamp token that uses an RSA key of 2048 bits, before an RSA key size of 1024 bits will be broken.
        The fact that the signature key of 1024 bits is no more suitable at the time of interest does not mean that the whole data structure
        is no more secure, if an RSA key size of 2048 bits is still suitable at the time of interest.
        </t>
        <t>
        In addition to the key size considerations, other considerations must be applied, like whether a time-stamp token has been
        provided by a trusted authority. It means that the simple use of a suitability policy is not the single element to consider
        when evaluating the security of a complex data structure using several cryptographic algorithms.
        </t>
        <t>
        The policies described in this document are suitable to evaluate basic cryptographic algorithms, like public key or hash algorithms,
        as well as cryptographic schemes (e.g. the PKCS#1 v1.5 signature schemes <xref target="RFC3447" />).
	But it MUST be kept in mind that a basic cryptographic algorithm that is suitable according to the policy, does not necessarily mean 
	that any cryptographic schemes based on this algorithm are also secure. 
	For example, a signature scheme based on RSA must not necessarily be secure if RSA is suitable.
	In case of a complete signature verification including validation of the certificate path, various algorithms have to be checked against
	the policy (i.e. signature schemes of signed data objects and revocation information, public key algorithms of the involved certificates, etc.).
	Thus a policy SHOULD contain evaluations of public key and hash algorithms as well as signature schemes. 
        </t>

        Re-encrypting documents that were originally encrypted using an algorithm that is no more suitable, will not protect the
        semantics of the document, if the document has been intercepted. However, for documents stored in an encrypted form,
        re-encryption must be considered, unless the document has lost its original value.

  		<t>
  		This section describes the verification 
  		of an Evidence Record according to
  		the Evidence Record Syntax (ERS, <xref target='RFC4998' />),
  		using the presented data structure.
  		</t>
  		<t>
  		An Evidence Record contains a sequence of archiveTimeStampChains which
  		consist of ArchiveTimeStamps.
  		For each archiveTimeStamp the hash algorithm used for the hash tree
  		(digestAlgorithm) and the public key algorithm and hash algorithm in the
  		timestamp signature have to be examined.
  		The relevant date is the time information in the timestamp (date of issue).
  		Starting with the first ArchiveTimestamp it has to be assured that
  		<list style="numbers">
	           <t>
	           The timestamp uses public key and hash algorithms
	           which have been suitable at the date of issue.
	           </t>
	           <t>
	           The hashtree was build with an hash algorithm that has been suitable
	           at the date of issue as well.
	           </t>
	           <t>
	           Algorithms for timestamp and hashtree in the preceding ArchiveTimestamp
	           must have been suitable at the issuing date of considered ArchiveTimestamp.
	           </t>
	           <t>
	           Algorithms in the last ArchiveTimstamp have to be suitable now.
	           </t>
	        </list>
	        If the check of one of these items fails, this will lead to a failure of the
	        verification.

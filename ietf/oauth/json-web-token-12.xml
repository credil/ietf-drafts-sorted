      <t>
	JWTs represent a set of claims as a JSON object that is
	encoded in a JWS and/or JWE structure.
	This JSON object is the  JWT Claims Set.
	As per <xref target="RFC4627">RFC 4627</xref>
	Section 2.2, the JSON object consists of zero or more
	name/value pairs (or members), where the names are strings and
	the values are arbitrary JSON values.
	These members are the claims represented by the JWT.
      </t>
      <t>
	The member names within the JWT Claims Set are
	referred to as Claim Names.  The
	corresponding values are referred to as Claim Values.
      </t>
      <t>
	The contents of the JWT Header describe the cryptographic
	operations applied to the JWT Claims Set.
	If the JWT Header is a JWS Header, the JWT is represented as a JWS,
	and the claims are digitally signed or MACed,
	with the JWT Claims Set being the JWS Payload.
	If the JWT Header is a JWE Header, the JWT is represented as a JWE,
	and the claims are encrypted,
	with the JWT Claims Set being the input Plaintext.
	A JWT may be enclosed in another JWE or JWS structure
	to create a Nested JWT,
	enabling nested signing and encryption to be performed.
      </t>
      <t>
	A JWT is represented as a sequence of URL-safe parts
	separated by period ('.') characters.
	Each part contains a base64url encoded value.
	The number of parts in the JWT is dependent upon
	the representation of the resulting JWS or JWE
	object using the JWS Compact Serialization
	or the JWE Compact Serialization.

	  This specification allows Claims present in the JWT Claims Set

    <section title="Rules for Creating and Validating a JWT" anchor="Validating">

      <t>
	To create a JWT, one MUST perform these steps.  The order of
	the steps is not significant in cases where there are no
	dependencies between the inputs and outputs of the steps.

        <list style="numbers">

	  <t>
	    Create a JWT Claims Set containing the desired claims.
	    Note that white space is explicitly allowed in the
	    representation and no canonicalization need be performed before
	    encoding.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Let the Message be the octets of the UTF-8 representation
	    of the JWT Claims Set.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Create a JWT Header containing the desired set of Header Parameters.
	    The JWT
	    MUST conform to either the <xref target="JWS" /> or <xref
	    target="JWE" /> specifications.
	    Note that white
	    space is explicitly allowed in the representation and no
	    canonicalization need be performed before encoding.
	  </t>
          <t>
	    Base64url encode the octets of the UTF-8 representation of
	    the JWT Header.  Let this be the Encoded JWT Header.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Depending upon whether the JWT is a JWS or JWE,
	    there are two cases:
	    <list style='symbols'>
	      <t>
		If the JWT is a JWS, create a JWS using the JWT
		Header as the JWS Header and the Message as the JWS
		Payload; all steps specified in <xref target="JWS" />
		for creating a JWS MUST be followed.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Else, if the JWT is a JWE, create a JWE using the
		JWT Header as the JWE Header and the Message as the
		JWE Plaintext; all steps specified in <xref
		target="JWE" /> for creating a JWE MUST be followed.
	      </t>
	    </list>
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    If a nested signing or encryption operation will be
	    performed, let the Message be the JWS or JWE, and
	    return to Step 3, using a <spanx style="verb">cty</spanx> (content type)
	    value of <spanx style="verb">JWT</spanx>
	    in the new JWT Header created in that step.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Otherwise, let the resulting JWT be the JWS or JWE.
	  </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
	When validating a JWT the following steps MUST be taken.  The
	order of the steps is not significant in cases where there are
	no dependencies between the inputs and outputs of the steps.
	If any of the listed steps fails then the JWT MUST be
	rejected for processing.
      </t>
      <t>
	<list style="numbers">
	  <t>
	    The JWT MUST contain at least one period ('.') character.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Let the Encoded JWT Header be the portion of the JWT
	    before the first period ('.') character.
	  </t>
          <t>
	    The Encoded JWT Header MUST be successfully base64url
	    decoded following the restriction given in this
	    specification that no padding characters have been used.
	  </t>
          <t>
	    The resulting JWT Header MUST be completely valid JSON syntax
	    conforming to <xref target="RFC4627">RFC 4627</xref>.
	  </t>
          <t>
	    The resulting JWT Header MUST be validated to only include
	    parameters and values whose syntax and semantics are both
	    understood and supported
	    or that are specified as being ignored when not understood.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Determine whether the JWT is a JWS or a JWE by
	    examining the <spanx style="verb">alg</spanx>
	    (algorithm) header value and optionally, the <spanx
	    style="verb">enc</spanx> (encryption method) header value,
	    if present.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Depending upon whether the JWT is a JWS or JWE,
	    there are two cases:
	    <list style='symbols'>
	      <t>
		If the JWT is a JWS, all steps specified in <xref

	      </t>
	      <t>
		Else, if the JWT is a JWE, all steps specified in <xref

		Let the Message be the JWE Plaintext.

	    If the JWT Header contains a <spanx style="verb">cty</spanx> (content type)
	    value of <spanx style="verb">JWT</spanx>,
	    then the Message is a JWT that was the subject of
	    nested signing or encryption operations.  In
	    this case, return to Step 1, using the Message as the JWT.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Otherwise, let the JWT Claims Set be the Message.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The JWT Claims Set MUST be completely valid
	    JSON syntax conforming to <xref target="RFC4627">RFC
	    4627</xref>.

      </t>

      <section title="String Comparison Rules" anchor="StringComparison">

	<t>
	  Processing a JWT inevitably requires comparing known strings
	  to values in JSON objects. For example, in checking what the
	  algorithm is, the Unicode string encoding
	  <spanx style="verb">alg</spanx> will be
	  checked against the member names in the JWT Header
	  to see if there is a matching Header Parameter Name.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Comparisons between JSON strings and other Unicode strings
	  MUST be performed by comparing Unicode code points without normalization

	  Values are registered with a Specification Required

          registration once they are satisfied that such a specification will be published.
	</t>
        <t>
          Registration requests must be sent to the [TBD]@ietf.org mailing list for review and

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="Security">
      <t>
	All of the security issues faced by any cryptographic application
	must be faced by a JWT/JWS/JWE/JWK agent.  Among these issues are protecting
	the user's private and symmetric keys, preventing various attacks, and helping the
	user avoid mistakes such as inadvertently encrypting a message for
	the wrong recipient.  The entire list of security considerations is
	beyond the scope of this document.
      </t>
      <t>
	All the security considerations in the JWS specification also
	apply to JWT, as do the JWE security considerations when
	encryption is employed.  In particular, the JWS
	JSON Security Considerations and Unicode Comparison Security Considerations
	apply equally to the JWT Claims Set in the same manner that
	they do to the JWS Header.
      </t>
      <t>
	While syntactically, the signing and encryption operations for
	Nested JWTs may be applied in any order,
	normally senders should sign the message and then encrypt the
	result (thus encrypting the signature). This prevents attacks
	in which the signature is stripped, leaving just an encrypted
	message, as well as providing privacy for the signer.
	Furthermore, signatures over encrypted text are not considered
	valid in many jurisdictions.
      </t>
      <t>
	Note that potential concerns about security issues related to
	the order of signing and encryption operations are already
	addressed by the underlying JWS and JWE specifications;
	in particular, because JWE only supports the use of
	authenticated encryption algorithms, cryptographic concerns
	about the potential need to sign after encryption that apply
	in many contexts do not apply to this specification.

    <section title="Relationship of JWTs to SAML Assertions" anchor="SAMLRelationship">
      <t>
	<xref target="OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os">SAML 2.0</xref> provides
	a standard for creating security tokens with greater expressivity
	and more security options than supported by JWTs. However, the
	cost of this flexibility and expressiveness is both size and complexity.
	SAML's use of XML <xref target="W3C.CR-xml11-20021015"/> and
	XML DSIG <xref target="RFC3275"/> contributes to the size
	of SAML assertions; its use of XML and especially
	XML Canonicalization <xref target="W3C.REC-xml-c14n-20010315"/>
	contributes to their complexity.
      </t>
      <t>
	JWTs are intended to provide a simple security token format that is
	small enough to fit into HTTP headers and query arguments in
	URIs. It does this by supporting a much simpler token model
	than SAML and using the <xref target="RFC4627">JSON</xref>
	object encoding syntax. It also supports securing tokens using
	Message Authentication Codes (MACs) and digital
	signatures using a smaller (and less flexible) format than XML
	DSIG.
      </t>
      <t>
	Therefore, while JWTs can do some of the things SAML assertions
	do, JWTs are not intended as a full replacement for SAML
	assertions, but rather as a token format to be used
	when ease of implementation or compactness are considerations.
      </t>
      <t>
	SAML Assertions are always statements made by an entity about a subject.
	JWTs are often used in the same manner, with the entity making the
	statements being represented by the <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> (issuer) claim, and
	the subject being represented by the <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> (subject) claim.
	However, with these claims being optional, other uses of the JWT format are also permitted.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Relationship of JWTs to Simple Web Tokens (SWTs)" anchor="SWTRelationship">

      <t>
	Both JWTs and Simple Web Tokens <xref target="SWT">SWT</xref>,
	at their core, enable sets of claims to be communicated
	between applications.  For SWTs, both the claim names and
	claim values are strings.  For JWTs, while claim names are
	strings, claim values can be any JSON type.  Both token types
	offer cryptographic protection of their content: SWTs with
	HMAC SHA-256 and JWTs with a choice of algorithms, including
	signature, MAC, and encryption algorithms.
      </t>

    <section title="Acknowledgements" anchor="Acknowledgements">

      <t>
	The authors acknowledge that the design of JWTs was
	intentionally influenced by the design and simplicity of <xref
	target="SWT">Simple Web Tokens</xref> and ideas for JSON
	tokens that Dick Hardt discussed within the OpenID community.
      </t>
      <t>
	Solutions for signing JSON content were previously explored by
	<xref target="MagicSignatures">Magic Signatures</xref>, <xref
	target="JSS">JSON Simple Sign</xref>, and <xref
	target="CanvasApp">Canvas Applications</xref>, all of which
	influenced this draft.

      <t>
	-12
	<list style='symbols'>
	  <t>
	    Tracked the JOSE change
	    refining the <spanx style="verb">typ</spanx> and
	    <spanx style="verb">cty</spanx> definitions to always be
	    MIME Media Types, with the omission of "application/"
	    prefixes recommended for brevity.
	    For compatibility with legacy implementations,
	    it is RECOMMENDED that <spanx style="verb">JWT</spanx>
	    always be spelled using uppercase characters
	    when used as a <spanx style="verb">typ</spanx> or
	    <spanx style="verb">cty</spanx> value.
	    As side effects, this change removed the
	    <spanx style="verb">typ</spanx> Claim definition
	    and narrowed the uses of the URI
	    <spanx style="verb">urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt</spanx>.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Updated base64url definition to match JOSE definition.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Changed terminology from "Reserved Claim Name" to "Registered Claim Name"
	    to match JOSE terminology change.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Applied other editorial changes to track parallel JOSE changes.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Clarified that the subject value may be scoped to be locally unique
	    in the context of the issuer or may be globally unique.

	<list style='symbols'>
	  <t>
	    Added a Nested JWT example.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Added <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> to the list of Claims

	</list>
      </t>

      <t>
	-09
	<list style='symbols'>
	  <t>
	    Clarified that the

	    in an application-specific manner
	    and has no effect upon the JWT processing.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Stated that recipients MUST either reject JWTs with
	    duplicate Header Parameter Names
	    or with duplicate Claim Names
	    or use a JSON parser that returns only
	    the lexically last duplicate member name.

      </t>
      <t>
	-07
	<list style='symbols'>

	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Changed from using the term "byte" to "octet" when referring to 8 bit values.

	  <t>
	    Changed the name of the <spanx style="verb">prn</spanx> claim
	    to <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> (subject)
	    both to more closely align with SAML name usage
	    and to use a more intuitive name.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Allow JWTs to have multiple audiences.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Applied editorial improvements suggested by
	    Jeff Hodges, Prateek Mishra, and Hannes Tschofenig.
	    Many of these simplified the terminology used.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Explained why Nested JWTs should be signed and then encrypted.

	  <t>
	    Clarified statements of the form "This claim is OPTIONAL"
	    to "Use of this claim is OPTIONAL".

	<list style='symbols'>
	  <t>
	    Promoted Initialization Vector from being a header parameter to being a top-level JWE element.
	    This saves approximately 16 bytes in the compact serialization,
	    which is a significant savings for some use cases.
	    Promoting the Initialization Vector out of the header also avoids repeating
	    this shared value in the JSON serialization.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Applied changes made by the RFC Editor to RFC 6749's registry language
	    to this specification.

      <t>
        -01
        <list style='symbols'>
	  <t>
	    Added the <spanx style="verb">cty</spanx> (content type) header parameter
	    for declaring type information about the secured content,
	    as opposed to the <spanx style="verb">typ</spanx> (type) header parameter,
	    which declares type information about this object.
	    This significantly simplified nested JWTs.

	  <t>
	    Moved description of how to determine whether a header is

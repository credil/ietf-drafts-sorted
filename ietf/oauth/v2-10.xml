    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>
        With the increasing use of distributed web services and cloud computing, third-party
        applications require access to server-hosted resources. These resources are usually
        protected and require authentication using the resource owner's credentials (typically a
        username and password).
      </t>
      <t>
        In the traditional client-server authentication model, the client accesses a protected
        resource on the server by authenticating with the server using the resource owner's
        credentials. In order to provide third-party applications access to protected resources,
        the resource owner shares its credentials with the third-party. This creates several
        problems and limitations:
        
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            Third-party applications are required to store the resource-owner's credentials
            for future use, typically a password in clear-text.
          </t>
          <t>
            Servers are required to support password (symmetric) authentication, despite the
            security weaknesses created by passwords.
          </t>
          <t>
            Third-party applications gain overly broad access to the resource-owner's protected
            resources, leaving resource owners without any ability to restrict access to a limited
            subset of resources, to limit access duration, or to limit access to the methods
            supported by these resources.
          </t>
          <t>
            Resource owners cannot revoke access to an individual third-party without revoking
            access to all third-parties, and must do so by changing their password.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        OAuth address these issues by separating the role of the client from that of the
        resource owner. In OAuth, the client (which is usually not the resource owner, but is
        acting on the resource owner's behalf) requests access to resources controlled by the
        resource owner and hosted by the resource server, and is issued a different set of
        credentials than those of the resource owner.
      </t>
      <t>
        Instead of using the resource owner's credentials to access protected resources, clients
        obtain an access token (a string which denotes a specific scope, duration, and other
        attributes). The format and structure of access tokens is beyond the scope of this
        specification.
      </t>
      <t>
        Tokens are issued to third-party clients by an authorization server with the approval of
        the resource owner. The client uses the access token to access the protected resources
        hosted by the resource server. The interaction between the authorization server and
        resource server is beyond the scope of this specification.
      </t>
      <t>
        For example, a web user (resource owner) can grant a printing service (client) access to
        her protected photos stored at a photo sharing service (resource server), without sharing
        her username and password with the printing service. Instead, she authenticates directly
        with an authentication service trusted by the photo sharing service (authorization server)
        which issues the printing service delegation-specific credentials (token).
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification defines the use of OAuth over <xref target='RFC2616'>HTTP</xref>
        (or HTTP over TLS as defined by <xref target='RFC2818' />). Other specifications may
        extend it for use with other transport protocols.

              A string representing an access authorization issued to the client. The string is
              usually opaque to the client. Tokens represent specific scopes and durations of
              access, granted by the resource owner, and enforced by the resource server and
              authorization servers. The token may denote an identifier used to retrieve the
              authorization information, or self-contain the authorization information in a
              verifiable manner (i.e. a token string consisting of some data and a signature).
              Tokens may be pure capabilities. Specific additional authentication credentials may

          OAuth provides a method for clients to access a protected resource on behalf of a
          resource owner. Before a client can access a protected resource, it must first obtain
          authorization from the resource owner, then exchange the access grant for an access token
          (representing the grant's scope, duration, and other attributes). The client accesses the
          protected resource by presenting the access token to the resource server.

          The abstract flow illustrated in <xref target='Figure 1' /> includes the following
          steps:

          <list style='format (%C)'>
            <t>
              The client requests authorization from the resource owner. The client should not
              request the resource owner's credentials directly. Instead, it should request
              authorization via an authorization server or other entities. For example, the client
              directs the resource owner to the authorization server which in turn issues it an
              access grant. When unavoidable, the client interacts directly with the end-user,
              asking for the end-user's username and password. If the client is acting
              autonomously, the authorization request is beyond the scope of this specification.
            </t>
            <t>
              The client is issued an access grant which represents the authorization provided by
              the resource owner. The access grant can be expressed as:

              <list style='symbols'>
                <t>
                  Authorization code - an access grant obtained via an authorization server.
                  <xref target='user-authorization' /> describes how to obtain an authorization
                  code when the end-user is present and using a user-agent.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Assertion - an access grant obtained using a different trust framework.
                  Assertions enable the client to utilize existing trust relationships to obtain an
                  access token. They provide a bridge between OAuth and other trust frameworks. The
                  access grant represented by an assertion depends on the assertion type, its
                  content, and how it was issued, which are beyond the scope of this specification.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Resource owner password credentials - obtained when interacting directly with a
                  resource-owner. Resource owner password credentials (i.e. a username and
                  password) should only be used when there is a high degree of trust between the
                  resource owner and the client (e.g. its computer operating system or a highly
                  privileged application). However, unlike the HTTP Basic authentication scheme
                  defined in <xref target='RFC2617' />, the resource owner's credentials are used
                  for a single request and are exchanged for an access token and refresh token.
                  This eliminates the need for the client to store the resource-owner's credentials
                  for future use.
                </t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t>
              The client requests an access token by authenticating with the authorization server,
              and presenting the access grant. The token request is described in
              <xref target='obtaining-token' />.
            </t>
            <t>
              The authorization server validates the client credentials and the access grant, and
              issues an access token with an optional refresh token. Access tokens usually have a
              shorter lifetime than the access grant. Refresh tokens usually have a lifetime equal
              to the duration of the access grant. When an access token expires, the refresh token
              is used to obtain a new access token without having to request another access grant
              from the resource owner.
            </t>
            <t>
              The client makes a protected resource request to the resource server, and presents
              the access token in order to gain access. Accessing a protected resource is described
              in <xref target='access-resource' />.
            </t>
            <t>
              The resource server validates the access token, and if valid, serves the request.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          When the client is acting on its own behalf (the client is also the resource owner),
          the client does not obtain an access grant. The simplified protocol flow is illustrated
          in <xref target='Figure 2' />:

        <t>
          OAuth supports a wide range of client types by providing a rich and extensible framework
          for establishing authorization and exchanging it for an access token. The methods detailed
          in this specification were designed to accommodate four client types: web servers,
          user-agents, native applications, and autonomous clients. Additional authorization flows
          and client profiles may be defined by other specifications to cover additional scenarios
          and client types.
        </t>

        <section title='Web Server'>
          <t>
            The web server profile is suitable for clients capable of interacting with the end-user's
            user-agent (typically a web browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests from the
            authorization server (capable of acting as an HTTP server).

            The web server flow illustrated in <xref target='Figure 4' /> includes the following
            steps:

            <list style='format (%C)'>
              <t>
                The web client initiates the flow by redirecting the end-user's user-agent to the
                end-user authorization endpoint as described in <xref target='user-authorization' />.
                The client includes its client identifier, requested scope, local state, and a
                redirect URI to which the authorization server will send the end-user back once
                access is granted (or denied).
              </t>
              <t>
                The authorization server authenticates the end-user (via the user-agent) and
                establishes whether the end-user grants or denies the client's access request.
              </t>
              <t>
                Assuming the end-user granted access, the authorization server redirects the
                user-agent back to the client to the redirection URI provided earlier. The
                authorization includes an authorization code for the client to use to obtain an
                access token.
              </t>
              <t>
                The client requests an access token from the authorization server by authenticating
                and including the authorization code received in the previous step as described in
                <xref target='obtaining-token' />.
              </t>
              <t>
                The authorization server validates the client credentials and the authorization
                code and responds back with the access token.

          <t>
            The user-agent profile is suitable for client applications residing in a user-agent,
            typically implemented in a browser using a scripting language such as JavaScript. These
            clients cannot keep client secrets confidential and the authentication of the client is
            based on the user-agent's same-origin policy.
          </t>
          <t>
            Unlike other profiles in which the client makes separate requests for end-user
            authorization and access token, the client receives the access token as a result of the
            end-user authorization request in the form of an HTTP redirection. The client requests
            the authorization server to redirect the user-agent to another web server or local
            resource accessible to the user-agent which is capable of extracting the access token
            from the response and passing it to the client.
          </t>
          <t>
            This user-agent profile does not utilize the client secret since the client executables
            reside on the end-user's computer or device which makes the client secret accessible
            and exploitable. Because the access token is encoded into the redirection URI, it may
            be exposed to the end-user and other applications residing on the computer or device.

            The user-agent flow illustrated in <xref target='Figure 5' /> includes the following
            steps:

            <list style='format (%C)'>
              <t>
                The client sends the user-agent to the end-user authorization endpoint as described
                in <xref target='user-authorization' />. The client includes its client identifier,
                requested scope, local state, and a redirect URI to which the authorization server
                will send the end-user back once authorization is granted (or denied).
              </t>
              <t>
                The authorization server authenticates the end-user (via the user-agent) and
                establishes whether the end-user grants or denies the client's access request.
              </t>
              <t>
                If the end-user granted access, the authorization server redirects the
                user-agent to the redirection URI provided earlier. The redirection URI includes
                the access token in the URI fragment.
              </t>
              <t>
                The user-agent follows the redirection instructions by making a request to the web
                server which does not include the fragment. The user-agent retains the fragment
                information locally.
              </t>
              <t>
                The web server returns a web page  (typically an HTML page with an embedded script)
                capable of accessing the full redirection URI including the fragment retained by the
                user-agent, and extracting the access token (and other parameters) contained in the
                fragment.
              </t>
              <t>
                The user-agent executes the script provided by the web server locally, which
                extracts the access token and passes it to the client.

        <section title='Native Application'>
          <t>
            Native application are clients running as native code on the end-user's computer or
            device (i.e. executing outside a user-agent or as a desktop program). These clients are
            often capable of interacting with (or embedding) the end-user's user-agent but are
            limited in how such interaction affects their end-user experience. In many cases,
            native applications are incapable of receiving direct callback requests from the
            server (e.g. firewall, operating system restrictions).
          </t>
          <t>
            Native application clients can be implemented in different ways based on their
            requirements and desired end-user experience. Native application clients can:

            <list style='symbols'>
              <t>
                Utilize the end-user authorization endpoint as described in
                <xref target='user-authorization' /> by launching an external user-agent. The
                client can capture the response by providing a redirection URI with a custom URI
                scheme (registered with the operating system to invoke the client application), or
                by providing a redirection URI pointing to a server-hosted resource under the
                client's control which makes the response available to the client (e.g. using the
                window title or other locations accessible from outside the user-agent).
              </t>
              <t>
                Utilize the end-user authorization endpoint as described in
                <xref target='user-authorization' /> by using an embedded user-agent. The client
                obtains the response by directly communicating with the embedded user-agent.
              </t>
              <t>
                Prompt end-users for their password and use them directly to obtain an access
                token. This is generally discouraged, as it hands the end-user's password directly
                to the third-party client which in turn has to store it in clear-text. It also
                requires the server to support password-based authentication.

          <t>
            When choosing between launching an external browser and an embedded user-agent,
            developers should consider the following:

            <list style='symbols'>
              <t>
                External user-agents may improve completion rate as the end-user may already be
                logged-in and not have to re-authenticate.
              </t>
              <t>
                Embedded user-agents often offer a better end-user flow, as they remove the need to
                switch context and open new windows.
              </t>
              <t>
                Embedded user-agents pose a security challenge because users are authenticating in
                an unidentified window without access to the visual protections offered by many
                user-agents.

        <section title='Autonomous'>
          <t>
            Autonomous clients utilize an existing trust relationship or framework to establish
            authorization. Autonomous clients can be implemented in different ways based on their
            requirements and the existing trust framework they rely upon. Autonomous clients can:

            <list style='symbols'>
              <t>
                Obtain an access token by authenticating with the authorization server using their
                client credentials. The scope of the access token is limited to the protected
                resources under the control of the client, or that of another resource owner
                previously arranged with the authorization server.
              </t>
              <t>
                Use an existing access grant expressed as an assertion using an assertion format
                supported by the authorization server. Using assertions requires the client to
                obtain a assertion (such as a <xref target='OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os'>SAML</xref>
                assertion) from an assertion issuer or to self-issue an assertion. The assertion
                format, the process by which the assertion is obtained, and the method of
                validating the assertion are defined by the assertion issuer and the authorization
                server, and are beyond the scope of this specification.

    <section title='Client Credentials' anchor='client-authentication'>
      <t>
        When interacting with the authorization server, the client identifies itself using a client
        identifier and authenticates using a set of client credentials. This specification provides
        one mechanism for authenticating the client using password credentials.
      </t>
      <t>
        The means through which the client obtains its credentials are beyond the scope of this
        specification, but usually involve registration with the authorization server.
        [[ OAuth Discovery provides one way of obtaining a client password ]]
      </t>
      <t>
        Due to the nature of some clients, authorization servers SHOULD NOT make assumptions
        about the confidentiality of client secrets without establishing trust with the
        client operator. Authorization servers SHOULD NOT issue client secrets to clients
        incapable of keeping their secrets confidential.
      </t>
      <t>
        The authorization server MAY authenticate the client using any appropriate set of
        credentials and authentication scheme. The client MUST NOT utilize more than one set of
        credentials or authentication mechanism with each request.
      </t>

      <section title='Client Password Credentials'>
        <t>
          The client password credentials use a shared symmetric secret to authenticate the client.
          The client identifier and password are included in the request using the

          The authorization server MUST accept the client credentials using both the request

    </section>

    <section title='Obtaining End-User Authorization' anchor='user-authorization'>
      <t>
        When the client interacts with an end-user, the end-user MUST first grant the client
        authorization to access its protected resources. Once obtained, the end-user access
        grant is expressed as an authorization code which the client uses to obtain an access
        token. To obtain an end-user authorization, the client sends the end-user to the
        end-user authorization endpoint.
      </t>
      <t>
        At the end-user authorization endpoint, the end-user first authenticates with the
        authorization server, and then grants or denies the access request. The way in which the
        authorization server authenticates the end-user (e.g. username and password login, OpenID,
        session cookies) and in which the authorization server obtains the end-user's
        authorization, including whether it uses a secure channel such as TLS, is beyond the scope
        of this specification. However, the authorization server MUST first verify the identity of
        the end-user.
      </t>
      <t>
        The location of the end-user authorization endpoint can be found in the service
        documentation, or can be obtained by using [[ OAuth Discovery ]]. The end-user
        authorization endpoint URI MAY include a query component as defined by
        <xref target='RFC3986' /> section 3, which must be retained when adding additional
        query parameters.
      </t>
      <t>
        Since requests to the end-user authorization endpoint result in user authentication and
        the transmission of sensitive information, the authorization server SHOULD require the
        use of a transport-layer security mechanism such as TLS when sending requests to the
        end-user authorization endpoint.
      </t>
      <t>
        In order to direct the end-user's user-agent to the authorization server, the client
        constructs the request URI by adding the following parameters to the end-user
        authorization endpoint URI query component using the
        <spanx style='verb'>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</spanx> format as defined by

    <section title='Accessing a Protected Resource' anchor='access-resource'>
      <t>
        Clients access protected resources by presenting an access token to the resource server.
        Access tokens act as bearer tokens, where the token string acts as a shared symmetric
        secret. This requires treating the access token with the same care as other secrets (e.g.
        end-user passwords). Access tokens SHOULD NOT be sent in the clear over an insecure
        channel.
      </t>
      <t>
        However, when it is necessary to transmit access tokens in the clear without a secure
        channel, authorization servers SHOULD issue access tokens with limited scope and lifetime
        to reduce the potential risk from a compromised access token.
      </t>
      <t>
        Clients MUST NOT make authenticated requests with an access token to unfamiliar resource
        servers, regardless of the presence of a secure channel.
      </t>
      <t>
        The resource server MUST validate the access token and ensure it has not expired and
        that its scope covers the requested resource. The methods used by the resource server
        to validate the access token are beyond the scope of this specification, but generally
        involve an interaction or coordination between the resource server and authorization
        server.
      </t>

      <section title='Authenticated Requests'>
        <t>
          Clients make authenticated token requests using the
          <spanx style='verb'>Authorization</spanx> request header field. Resource servers MUST
          accept authenticated requests using the <spanx style='verb'>OAuth</spanx> HTTP
          authentication scheme as described in <xref target='authz-header' />, and MAY support
          additional methods.
        </t>
        <t>
          Alternatively, clients MAY attempt to include the access token using the HTTP request
          URI in the query component as described in <xref target='query-param' />, or in the HTTP
          body when using the <spanx style='verb'>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</spanx> content
          type as described in <xref target='body-param' />. Resource server MAY support these
          alternative methods.
        </t>
        <t>
          Clients SHOULD only use the request URI or body when the
          <spanx style='verb'>Authorization</spanx> request header field is not available, and MUST
          NOT use more than one method in each request.

            The <spanx style='verb'>Authorization</spanx> request header field is used by clients

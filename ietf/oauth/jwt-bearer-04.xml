      <t>This specification defines the use of a JSON Web Token (JWT) Bearer Token as a means for requesting an OAuth 2.0 access
        token as well as for use as a means of client authentication.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	<xref target="JWT">JSON Web Token (JWT)</xref>
	is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) <xref target="RFC4627"/>
	based security token encoding that enables
	identity and security information to be shared across security
	domains.
        A security token is generally issued by an identity provider
        and consumed by a relying party that relies on its content to
        identify the token's subject for security related purposes.
      </t>

      <t>
        <xref target="RFC6749">The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework</xref>
        provides
        a method for making authenticated HTTP requests to a resource using an access token.
        Access tokens are issued to third-party clients by an
        authorization server (AS) with the (sometimes implicit) approval of the resource owner.
        In OAuth, an authorization grant is an abstract term used to describe
        intermediate credentials that represent the resource owner
        authorization.  An authorization grant is used by the client to obtain an access token.
        Several authorization grant types are defined to support a wide range
        of client types and user experiences.
        OAuth also allows for the definition of new extension grant types
        to support additional clients or to provide a bridge between OAuth and other trust frameworks.
        Finally, OAuth allows the definition of additional authentication mechanisms to be used by clients when interacting with the authorization server.
      </t>

      <t>The <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-assertions">Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0</xref> is an abstract extension to OAuth 2.0 that provides a general
        framework for the use of Assertions (a.k.a. Security Tokens) as client credentials and/or authorization grants with OAuth 2.0.
        This specification profiles the <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-assertions">Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0</xref> to define an extension grant type that uses a JSON Web Token (JWT) Bearer Token to
        request an OAuth 2.0 access token as well as for use as client credentials.
        The format and processing rules for the JWT defined in this specification are intentionally similar,
        though not identical, to those in the closely related
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-saml2-bearer">SAML 2.0 Bearer Assertion Profiles for OAuth 2.0</xref>.
      </t>

      <t>This document defines how a JSON Web Token (JWT) Bearer Token can be used to request an access token when a client wishes to utilize an existing trust
        relationship, expressed through the semantics of (and digital signature calculated over) the JWT,
        without a direct user approval step at the authorization server.  It also defines how a JWT can be used as a client authentication mechanism.
        The use of a security token for client
        authentication is orthogonal to and separable from using a security token as an
        authorization grant.  They can be used either in combination or separately.
        Client authentication using a JWT is nothing more than an alternative way for a client to authenticate
        to the token endpoint and must be used in conjunction with some grant type to form a complete and
        meaningful protocol request. JWT authorization grants may be used with or without client authentication
        or identification. Whether or not client authentication is needed in conjunction with a JWT authorization
        grant, as well as the supported types of client authentication, are policy decisions at the discretion of the authorization server.
      </t>
      <t>The process by which the client obtains the JWT, prior to exchanging it with the authorization server or using it for client authentication, is out of scope.</t>

      <t>
	In order to issue an access token response as described in
	<xref target="RFC6749">The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework</xref>
	or to rely on a JWT for client authentication,
	the authorization server MUST validate the JWT according to the criteria below.
	Application of additional restrictions and policy are at the discretion of the authorization server.
      </t>
      <t>
	<list style="symbols">

	  <t>
	    The JWT MUST contain an <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx>
	    (issuer) claim that contains a unique identifier for the
	    entity that issued the JWT.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The JWT MUST contain a <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx>
	    (subject) claim identifying the subject of the transaction.
	    The subject MAY identify the resource owner for
	    whom the access token is being requested.
	    For client authentication, the subject MUST be the <spanx style='verb'>client_id</spanx> of the OAuth client.  When using
	    a JWT as an authorization grant, the subject SHOULD identify
	    an authorized accessor for whom the access token is being requested (typically the resource owner, or an authorized delegate).
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The JWT MUST contain an <spanx style="verb">aud</spanx>
	    (audience) claim containing an audience value that
	    identifies the
	    authorization server, or the service provider principal entity of its controlling domain, as an
	    intended audience.  The token endpoint URL of the authorization server MAY be used as an
	    acceptable value for an <spanx style="verb">aud</spanx> element.
	    The authorization server MUST verify that it is an intended audience for
	    the JWT.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The JWT MUST contain an <spanx style="verb">exp</spanx>
	    (expiration) claim that limits the time window during
	    which the JWT can be used.  The authorization server
	    MUST verify that the expiration time has not passed,
	    subject to allowable clock skew between systems.  The
	    authorization server MAY reject JWTs with an <spanx
	    style="verb">exp</spanx> claim value that is
	    unreasonably far in the future.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The JWT MAY contain an <spanx style="verb">nbf</spanx>
	    (not before) claim that identifies the time before which
	    the token MUST NOT be accepted for processing.

	  <t>
	    The JWT MAY contain an <spanx style="verb">iat</spanx>
	    (issued at) claim that identifies the time at which the

	    with an <spanx style="verb">iat</spanx> claim value that is
	    unreasonably far in the past.

	  <t>
	    The JWT MAY contain a <spanx style="verb">jti</spanx>
	    (JWT ID) claim that provides a unique identifier for
	    the token.
	    The authorization server MAY ensure that JWTs are not
	    replayed by maintaining the set of used
	    <spanx style="verb">jti</spanx> values for the length of
	    time for which the JWT would be considered valid based

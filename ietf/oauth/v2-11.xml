    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>
        With the increasing use of distributed web services and cloud computing, third-party
        applications require access to server-hosted resources. These resources are usually
        protected and require authentication using the resource owner's credentials (typically a
        username and password).
      </t>
      <t>
        In the traditional client-server authentication model, the client accesses a protected
        resource on the server by authenticating with the server using the resource owner's
        credentials. In order to provide third-party applications access to protected resources,
        the resource owner shares its credentials with the third-party. This creates several
        problems and limitations:

        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            Third-party applications are required to store the resource-owner's credentials
            for future use, typically a password in clear-text.
          </t>
          <t>
            Servers are required to support password authentication, despite the security
            weaknesses created by passwords.
          </t>
          <t>
            Third-party applications gain overly broad access to the resource-owner's protected
            resources, leaving resource owners without any ability to restrict access to a limited
            subset of resources, to limit access duration, or to limit access to the methods
            supported by these resources.
          </t>
          <t>
            Resource owners cannot revoke access to an individual third-party without revoking
            access to all third-parties, and must do so by changing their password.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        OAuth addresses these issues by separating the role of the client from that of the
        resource owner. In OAuth, the client (which is usually not the resource owner, but is
        acting on the resource owner's behalf) requests access to resources controlled by the
        resource owner and hosted by the resource server, and is issued a different set of
        credentials than those of the resource owner.
      </t>
      <t>
        Instead of using the resource owner's credentials to access protected resources, the client
        obtains an access token - a string which denotes a specific scope, duration, and other
        attributes. Access tokens are issued to third-party clients by an authorization server with
        the approval of the resource owner. The client uses the access token to access the
        protected resources hosted by the resource server.
      </t>
      <t>
        For example, a web user (resource owner) can grant a printing service (client) access to
        her protected photos stored at a photo sharing service (resource server), without sharing
        her username and password with the printing service. Instead, she authenticates directly
        with an authentication service trusted by the photo sharing service (authorization server)
        which issues the printing service delegation-specific credentials (token).
      </t>
      <t>
        Access tokens can have different formats, structures, and methods of utilization (e.g.
        cryptographic properties), based on the resource server security requirements. Access token
        attributes and the methods used to access protected resources are beyond the scope of this
        specification and are defined by companion specifications. The interaction between the
        authorization server and resource server is beyond the scope of this specification.
      </t>

            <t hangText='resource owner'>
              <vspace />
              An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource.
            </t>
            <t hangText='end-user'>
              <vspace />
              A human resource owner.
            </t>
            <t hangText='token'>
              <vspace />
              A string representing an access authorization issued to the client. The string is
              usually opaque to the client. Tokens represent specific scopes and durations of
              access, granted by the resource owner, and enforced by the resource server and
              authorization servers. The token may denote an identifier used to retrieve the
              authorization information, or self-contain the authorization information in a
              verifiable manner (i.e. a token string consisting of some data and a signature).
              Tokens may be pure capabilities. Specific additional authentication credentials may
              be required in order for a client to use a token.
            </t>
            <t hangText='access token'>
              <vspace />
              A token used by the client to make authenticated requests on behalf of the resource
              owner.
            </t>
            <t hangText='refresh token'>
              <vspace />
              A token used by the client to obtain a new access token without having to involve
              the resource owner.
            </t>
            <t hangText='authorization code'>
              A short-lived token representing the authorization provided by the end-user. The
              authorization code is used to obtain an access token and a refresh token.
            </t>
            <t hangText='access grant'>
              A general term used to describe the intermediate credentials (such as an end-user
              password or authorization code) representing the resource owner authorization. Access
              grants are used by the client to obtain an access token. By exchanging access
              grants of different types for an access token, the resource server is only required
              to support a single authentication scheme.
            </t>
            <t hangText='authorization server'>
              <vspace />
              A server capable of issuing tokens after successfully authenticating the resource
              owner and obtaining authorization. The authorization server may be the same server as
              the resource server, or a separate entity. A single authorization server may issue
              tokens for multiple resource servers.
            </t>
            <t hangText='end-user authorization endpoint'>
              <vspace />
              The authorization server's HTTP endpoint capable of authenticating the end-user and
              obtaining authorization. The end-user authorization endpoint is described in
              <xref target='user-authorization' />.
            </t>
            <t hangText='token endpoint'>
              <vspace />
              The authorization server's HTTP endpoint capable of issuing tokens and refreshing
              expired tokens. The token endpoint is described in <xref target='obtaining-token' />.
            </t>
            <t hangText='client identifier'>
              <vspace />
              A unique identifier issued to the client to identify itself to the authorization
              server. Client identifiers may have a matching secret. The client identifier is
              described in <xref target='client-authentication' />.

      <section title='Overview'>
        <t>
          OAuth provides a method for clients to access a protected resource on behalf of a
          resource owner. Before a client can access a protected resource, it must first obtain
          authorization (access grant) from the resource owner, then exchange the access grant for
          an access token (representing the grant's scope, duration, and other attributes). The
          client accesses the protected resource by presenting the access token to the resource
          server.
        </t>
        <t>
          The access token provides an abstraction layer, replacing different authorization
          constructs (e.g. username and password, assertion) for a single token understood by the
          resource server. This abstraction enables issuing access tokens valid for a short time
          period, as well as removing the resource server's need to understand a wide range of
          authentication schemes.

          The abstract flow illustrated in <xref target='Figure 1' /> describes the overall
          protocol architecture and includes the following steps:

          <list style='format (%C)'>
            <t>
              The client requests authorization from the resource owner. The authorization request
              can be made directly to the resource owner, or preferably indirectly via an
              intermediary such as an authorization server.
            </t>
            <t>
              The client receives an access grant which represents the authorization provided by
              the resource owner.
            </t>
            <t>
              The client requests an access token by authenticating with the authorization server
              using its client credentials, and presenting the access grant.
            </t>
            <t>
              The authorization server validates the client credentials and the access grant, and
              if valid issues an access token.
            </t>
            <t>
              The client makes a protected resource request to the resource server by presenting
              the access token.
            </t>
            <t>
              The resource server validates the access token, and if valid, serves the request.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Access Grants'>
        <t>
          The access grant represents the authorization provided by the resource owner. The access
          grant type depends on the method used by the client and supported by the authorization
          server to obtain it.
        </t>

        <section title='Authorization Code'>
          <t>
            The authorization code is an access grant obtained by directing the end-user to an
            authorization server. The authorization server authenticates the end-user, obtains
            authorization, and issues the an authorization code to the client. Because the end-user
            only authenticates with the authorization server, the end-user's password is never
            shared with the client.
          </t>
          <t>
            The authorization code access grant is suitable when the client is interacting with an
            end-user via a user-agent.
          </t>

          <t>
            The authorization code flow illustrated in <xref target='Figure 2' /> includes the
            following steps:

            <list style='format (%C)'>
              <t>
                The client initiates the flow by directing the end-user's user-agent to the
                authorization server's end-user authorization endpoint. The client includes its
                client identifier, requested scope, local state, and a redirection URI (to which
                the authorization server will send the user-agent back once access is granted or
                denied).
              </t>
              <t>
                The authorization server authenticates the end-user (via the user-agent) and
                establishes whether the end-user grants or denies the client's access request.
              </t>
              <t>
                If access is granted, the authorization server directs the user-agent back to the
                client using the redirection URI provided. The authorization server includes an
                authorization code for the client to use to obtain an access token.
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            Once the client obtains an authorization code, it requests an access token by
            authenticating with the authorization server (using its client credentials) and
            presenting the authorization code (access grant).
          </t>
          <t>
            In cases where the client is incapable of maintaining its client credentials secret
            (such as native applications or an application implemented as a user-agent script), the
            authorization server issues an access token directly to the client in step (C), instead
            of issuing an authorization code.
          </t>
          <t>
            Obtaining an authorization code is described in <xref target='user-authorization' />.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title='Resource Owner Password Credentials'>
          <t>
            The resource owner password credentials (e.g. a username and password) can be used
            directly as an access grant to obtain an access token. The credentials should only be
            used when there is a high degree of trust between the resource owner and the client
            (e.g. its computer operating system or a highly privileged application), and when
            other access grant types are not available (such as an authorization code).
          </t>
          <t>
            Even though this grant type requires direct client access to the resource owner's
            credentials, the resource owner's credentials are used for a single request and are
            exchanged for an access token. Unlike the HTTP Basic authentication scheme defined in
            <xref target='RFC2617' />, this grant type eliminates the need for the client to store
            the resource-owner's credentials for future use.
          </t>
          <t>
            In <xref target='Figure 3' />, the client requests authorization from the resource
            owner directly. When the resource owner is an end-user, the client typically prompts
            the end-user for the username and password.

        <section title='Client Credentials'>
          <t>
            The client credentials can be used as an access grant when the authorization scope is
            limited to the protected resources under the control of the client, or other protected
            resources previously arranged with the authorization server. Client credentials are
            used as an access grant typically when the client is acting on its own behalf (the
            client is also the resource owner).
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title='Refresh Token'>
          <t>
            Access tokens usually have a shorter lifetime than authorized by the resource owner.
            When issuing an access token, the authorization server can include a refresh token
            which is used by the client to obtain a new access token when the current access token
            expires. When requesting a new access token, the refresh token acts as an access grant.
            Using a refresh token removes the need to interact with the resource owner again, or to
            store the original access grant used to obtain the access token and refresh token.

            The refresh token flow illustrated in <xref target='Figure 4' /> includes the following
            steps:

            <list style='format (%C)'>
              <t>
                The client requests an access token by authenticating with the authorization server
                using its client credentials, and presenting an access grant.
              </t>
              <t>
                The authorization server validates the client credentials and the access grant, and
                if valid issues an access token and a refresh token.
              </t>
              <t>
                The client makes a protected resource requests to the resource server by presenting
                the access token.
              </t>
              <t>
                The resource server validates the access token, and if valid, serves the request.
              </t>
              <t>
                Steps (C) and (D) repeat until the access token expires. If the client does not
                know the access token expired, it makes another protected resource request.
                Otherwise, it skips to step (G).
              </t>
              <t>
                Since the access token is invalid (expired), the resource server returns an invalid
                token error.
              </t>
              <t>
                The client requests a new access token by authenticating with the authorization
                server using its client credentials, and presenting the refresh token (as the
                access grant).
              </t>
              <t>
                The authorization server validates the client credentials and the refresh token,
                and if valid issues a new access token (and optionally, a new refresh token).

        <section title='Assertion'>
          <t>
            Assertions provide a bridge between OAuth and other trust frameworks. They enable the
            client to utilize existing trust relationships in order to obtain an access token. The
            access grant represented by an assertion depends on the assertion type, its content,
            and how it was issued, which are beyond the scope of this specification.
          </t>
          <t>
            Assertions are used as part of the protocol extensibility model, providing a way for
            authorization servers to support additional access grant types.

          The web server flow illustrated in <xref target='Figure 6' /> includes the following

          <list style='format (%C)'>
            <t>
              The web client initiates the flow by redirecting the end-user's user-agent to the
              end-user authorization endpoint as described in <xref target='user-authorization' />.
              The client includes its client identifier, requested scope, local state, and a
              redirect URI to which the authorization server will send the end-user back once
              access is granted (or denied).
            </t>
            <t>
              The authorization server authenticates the end-user (via the user-agent) and
              establishes whether the end-user grants or denies the client's access request.
            </t>
            <t>
              Assuming the end-user granted access, the authorization server redirects the
              user-agent back to the client to the redirection URI provided earlier. The
              authorization includes an authorization code for the client to use to obtain an
              access token.
            </t>
            <t>
              The client requests an access token from the authorization server by authenticating
              and including the authorization code received in the previous step as described in
              <xref target='obtaining-token' />.
            </t>
            <t>
              The authorization server validates the client credentials and the authorization
              code and responds back with the access token.

      <section title='User-Agent' anchor='user-agent'>
        <t>
          The user-agent profile is suitable for client applications residing in a user-agent,
          typically implemented in a browser using a scripting language such as JavaScript. These
          clients cannot keep client secrets confidential and the authentication of the client is
          based on the user-agent's same-origin policy.
        </t>
        <t>
          Unlike other profiles in which the client makes separate requests for end-user
          authorization and access token, the client receives the access token as a result of the
          end-user authorization request in the form of an HTTP redirection. The client requests
          the authorization server to redirect the user-agent to another web server or local
          resource accessible to the user-agent which is capable of extracting the access token
          from the response and passing it to the client.
        </t>
        <t>
          This user-agent profile does not utilize the client secret since the client executables
          reside on the end-user's computer or device which makes the client secret accessible
          and exploitable. Because the access token is encoded into the redirection URI, it may
          be exposed to the end-user and other applications residing on the computer or device.

            <t>
              The client sends the user-agent to the end-user authorization endpoint as described

              The authorization server authenticates the end-user (via the user-agent) and

            </t>
            <t>
              If the end-user granted access, the authorization server redirects the
              user-agent to the redirection URI provided earlier. The redirection URI includes
              the access token in the URI fragment.
            </t>
            <t>
              The user-agent follows the redirection instructions by making a request to the web
              server which does not include the fragment. The user-agent retains the fragment
              information locally.
            </t>
            <t>
              The web server returns a web page  (typically an HTML page with an embedded script)
              capable of accessing the full redirection URI including the fragment retained by the
              user-agent, and extracting the access token (and other parameters) contained in the

            </t>
            <t>
              The user-agent executes the script provided by the web server locally, which

      <section title='Native Application'>
        <t>
          Native applications are clients running as native code on the end-user's computer or
          device (i.e. executing outside a user-agent or as a desktop program). These clients are
          often capable of interacting with (or embedding) the end-user's user-agent but are
          limited in how such interaction affects their end-user experience. In many cases,
          native applications are incapable of receiving direct callback requests from the
          server (e.g. firewall, operating system restrictions).
        </t>
        <t>
          Native application clients can be implemented in different ways based on their
          requirements and desired end-user experience. Native application clients can:

          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>
              Utilize the end-user authorization endpoint as described in
              <xref target='user-authorization' /> by launching an external user-agent. The
              client can capture the response by providing a redirection URI with a custom URI
              scheme (registered with the operating system to invoke the client application), or
              by providing a redirection URI pointing to a server-hosted resource under the
              client's control which makes the response available to the client (e.g. using the
              window title or other locations accessible from outside the user-agent).
            </t>
            <t>
              Utilize the end-user authorization endpoint as described in
              <xref target='user-authorization' /> by using an embedded user-agent. The client
              obtains the response by directly communicating with the embedded user-agent.
            </t>
            <t>
              Prompt end-users for their password and use them directly to obtain an access
              token. This is generally discouraged, as it hands the end-user's password directly
              to the third-party client which in turn has to store it in clear-text. It also
              requires the server to support password-based authentication.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          When choosing between launching an external browser and an embedded user-agent,
          developers should consider the following:

          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>
              External user-agents may improve completion rate as the end-user may already be
              logged-in and not have to re-authenticate.
            </t>
            <t>
              Embedded user-agents often offer a better end-user flow, as they remove the need to
              switch context and open new windows.
            </t>
            <t>
              Embedded user-agents pose a security challenge because users are authenticating in
              an unidentified window without access to the visual protections offered by many
              user-agents.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Autonomous'>
        <t>
          Autonomous clients utilize an existing trust relationship or framework to establish
          authorization. Autonomous clients can be implemented in different ways based on their
          requirements and the existing trust framework they rely upon. Autonomous clients can:

          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>
              Obtain an access token by authenticating with the authorization server using their
              client credentials. The scope of the access token is limited to the protected
              resources under the control of the client, or that of another resource owner
              previously arranged with the authorization server.
            </t>
            <t>
              Use an existing access grant expressed as an assertion using an assertion format
              supported by the authorization server. Using assertions requires the client to
              obtain an assertion (such as a <xref target='OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os'>SAML</xref>
              assertion) from an assertion issuer or to self-issue an assertion. The assertion
              format, the process by which the assertion is obtained, and the method of

        When interacting with the authorization server, the client identifies itself using a set of
        client credentials which include a client identifier and other properties for client
        authentication. The means through which the client obtains its credentials are beyond the
        scope of this specification, but typically involve registration with the authorization
        server.
      </t>
      <t>
        Due to the nature of some clients, authorization servers SHOULD NOT make assumptions
        about the confidentiality of client secrets without establishing trust with the client.
        Authorization servers SHOULD NOT issue client secrets to clients incapable of keeping their
        secrets confidential.
      </t>
      <t>
        The authorization server MAY authenticate the client using any appropriate set of
        credentials and authentication schemes. The client MUST NOT include more than one set of
        credentials or authentication mechanism with each request.
      </t>

      <section title='Client Password Credentials'>
        <t>
          The client password credentials use a shared symmetric secret to authenticate the client.
          The client identifier and password are included in the request using the
          HTTP Basic authentication scheme as defined in <xref target='RFC2617' /> by including the
          client identifier as the username and client password as the password.

          The authorization server MUST accept the client credentials using both the request

          credentials.

      <section title='Client Assertion Credentials'>
        <t>
          The client assertion credentials are used in cases where a password (clear-text shared
          symmetric secret) is unsuitable or does not provide sufficient security for client
          authentication. In such cases it is common to use other mechanisms such as HMAC or
          digital signatures that do not require sending clear-text secrets. The client assertion
          credentials provide an extensible mechanism to use an assertion format supported by the
          authorization server for authentication the client.
        </t>
        <t>
          Using assertions requires the client to obtain an assertion (such as a
          <xref target='OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os'>SAML</xref> assertion) from an assertion issuer or
          to self-issue an assertion. The assertion format, the process by which the assertion is
          obtained, and the method of validating the assertion are defined by the assertion issuer
          and the authorization server, and are beyond the scope of this specification.
        </t>
        <t>
          When using a client assertion, the client includes the following parameters:

          <list style='hanging' hangIndent='6'>
            <t hangText='client_assertion_type'>
              REQUIRED. The format of the assertion as defined by the authorization server. The value

        <t>
          When obtaining an access token using a client assertion together with an authorization code
          (as described in <xref target='code-grant-type' />), a mechanism is needed to map between the
          value of <spanx style='verb'>client_id</spanx> parameter used to obtain the authorization code,
          and the client assertion. Such mechanism is beyond the out of scope for this specification,
          but MUST be specified for any client assertion type used in combination with an authorization
          code.
        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization server MUST reject access token requests using client assertion credentials
          that do not contain HMAC or signed values that:

          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>
              State the assertion was specifically issued to be consumed by the receiving endpoint

              identifier).
            </t>
            <t>
              Identify the entity that issued the assertion (typically via an issuer value).
            </t>
            <t>
              Identify when the assertion expires as an absolute time (typically via an expiration
              value containing a UTC date/time value). The authorization server MUST reject expired
              assertions.

    <section title='Obtaining End-User Authorization' anchor='user-authorization'>
      <t>
        Before the client can access a protect resource, it MUST first obtain authorization from
        the end-user. To obtain an end-user authorization, the client sends the end-user to the
        end-user authorization endpoint. Once obtained, the end-user access grant is expressed as
        an authorization code which the client uses to obtain an access token.
      </t>
      <t>
        At the end-user authorization endpoint, the end-user first authenticates with the
        authorization server, and then grants or denies the access request. The way in which the
        authorization server authenticates the end-user (e.g. username and password login, OpenID,
        session cookies) and in which the authorization server obtains the end-user's
        authorization, including whether it uses a secure channel such as TLS, is beyond the scope
        of this specification. However, the authorization server MUST first verify the identity of
        the end-user.
      </t>
      <t>
        The location of the end-user authorization endpoint can be found in the service
        documentation. The end-user authorization endpoint URI MAY include a query component as
        defined by <xref target='RFC3986' /> section 3, which must be retained when adding
        additional query parameters.
      </t>
      <t>
        Since requests to the end-user authorization endpoint result in user authentication and
        the transmission of sensitive information, the authorization server SHOULD require the
        use of a transport-layer security mechanism such as TLS when sending requests to the
        end-user authorization endpoint.
      </t>

      <section title='Authorization Request'>
        <t>
          In order to direct the end-user's user-agent to the authorization server, the client

          authorization endpoint URI query component using the
          <spanx style='verb'>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</spanx> format as defined by

          If the client has previously registered a redirection URI with the authorization server,

          registered URI associated with the client identifier. The authorization server SHOULD
          NOT redirect the user-agent to unregistered or untrusted URIs to prevent the endpoint
          from being used as an open redirector. If no valid redirection URI is available, the
          authorization server SHOULD inform the end-user of the error occured.

        <t>
          The authorization server validates the request to ensure all required parameters are
          present and valid. If the request is invalid, the authorization server redirects the

        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization server authenticates the end-user and obtains an authorization
          decision (by asking the end-user or by establishing approval via other means). When a
          decision has been established, the authorization server directs the end-user's
          user-agent to the provided client redirection URI using an HTTP redirection response,

      <t>
        The client obtains an access token by authenticating with the authorization server and
        presenting its access grant (in the form of an authorization code, resource owner
        credentials, an assertion, or a refresh token).
      </t>
      <t>
        Since requests to the token endpoint result in the transmission of clear-text
        credentials in the HTTP request and response, the authorization server MUST require the
        use of a transport-layer security mechanism when sending requests to the token endpoints.
        Servers MUST support TLS 1.2 as defined in <xref target='RFC5246' />, and MAY support
        additional transport-layer security mechanisms.
      </t>
      <t>
        The client requests an access token by making an HTTP <spanx style='verb'>POST</spanx>
        request to the token endpoint. The location of the token endpoint can be found in the
        service documentation. The token endpoint URI MAY include a query component.
      </t>
      <t>
        The client authenticates with the authorization server by adding its client credentials to
        the request as described in <xref target='client-authentication' />. The authorization
        server MAY allow unauthenticated access token requests when the client identity does not
        matter (e.g. anonymous client) or when the client identity is established via other means
        (e.g. using an assertion access grant).
      </t>
      <t>
        The client constructs the request by including the following parameters using the
        <spanx style='verb'>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</spanx> format in the HTTP request
        entity-body:

            <spanx style='verb'>refresh_token</spanx>,
            <spanx style='verb'>client_credentials</spanx>, or an absolute URI identifying an
            assertion format supported by the authorization server.

            <vspace />
            OPTIONAL. The scope of the access request expressed as a list of space-delimited
            strings. The value of the <spanx style='verb'>scope</spanx> parameter is defined
            by the authorization server. If the value contains multiple space-delimited
            strings, their order does not matter, and each string adds an additional access
            range to the requested scope. If the access grant being used already represents an
            approved scope (e.g. authorization code, assertion), the requested scope MUST be equal
            or lesser than the scope previously granted, and if omitted is treated as equal to the
            previously approved scope.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        In addition, the client MUST include the appropriate parameters listed for the selected
        access grant type as described in <xref target='access-grant-types' />.
      </t>
      <t>
        Parameters sent without a value MUST be treated as if they were omitted from the request.

    <section title='Accessing a Protected Resource' anchor='access-resource'>
      <t>
        Clients access protected resources by presenting an access token to the resource server.
        The resource server MUST validate the access token and ensure it has not expired and
        that its scope covers the requested resource. The methods used by the resource server
        to validate the access token are beyond the scope of this specification, but generally
        involve an interaction or coordination between the resource server and authorization
        server.
      </t>
      <t>
        The method in which the client utilized the access token to authenticate with the resource
        server depends on the type of access token issued by the authorization server.

Abstract

   This document requests one Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)
   from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for a class of 
   real-time traffic.  This class conforms to the Expedited Forwarding 
   Per Hop Behavior.  It is also admitted using a CAC procedure 
   involving authentication, authorization, and capacity admission.  
   This differs from a real-time traffic class conforming to the 
   Expedited Forwarding Per Hop Behavior but not subject to capacity 
   admission or subject to very coarse capacity admission.

1.  Introduction

   This document requests one Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)
   from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for a class of
   real-time traffic.  This class conforms to the Expedited Forwarding
   [RFC3246] [RFC3247] Per Hop Behavior.  It is also admitted using a
   CAC procedure involving authentication, authorization, and capacity
   admission.  This differs from a real-time traffic class conforming 
   to the Expedited Forwarding Per Hop Behavior but not subject to 
   capacity admission or subject to very coarse capacity admission.

   It also recommends that certain classes of video described in
   [RFC4594] be treated as requiring capacity admission as well.

   Real-time traffic flows have one or more potential congestion points
   between the endpoints.  Reserving capacity for these flows is 
   important to application performance.  All of these applications 
   have low tolerance to jitter (aka delay variation) and loss, as 
   summarized in Section 2, and most (except for multimedia 
   conferencing) have inelastic flow behavior from Figure 1 of 
   [RFC4594].  Inelastic flow behavior and low jitter/loss tolerance 
   are the service characteristics that define the need for admission 
   control behavior.

   One of the reasons behind this is the need for classes of traffic
   that are handled under special policies.  Service providers need to 
   distinguish between special-policy traffic and other classes, 
   particularly the existing VoIP services that perform no capacity 
   admission or only very coarse capacity admission and can exceed 
   their allocated resources.

   The requested DSCP applies to the Telephony Service Class described
   in [RFC4594].

   Since video classes have not had the history of mixing admitted and
   non-admitted traffic in the same Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) as has
   occurred for EF, an additional DSCP code point is not recommended 
   within this document for video.  Instead, the recommended "best 
   practice" is to perform admission control for all traffic in three 
   of [RFC4594]'s video classes: the 

   o  Interactive Real-Time Traffic (CS4, used for Video conferencing
      and Interactive gaming),

   o  Broadcast TV (CS3) for use in a video on demand context, and

   o  AF4 Multimedia Conferencing (video conferencing).

   Other video classes are believed to not have the current problem of
   confusion with unadmitted traffic and therefore would not benefit
   from the notion of a separate DSCP for admitted traffic.  Within an
   ISP and on inter-ISP links (i.e. within networks whose internal 
   paths are uniform at hundreds of megabits per second or faster), one
   would expect all of this traffic to be carried in the Real-Time 
   Traffic (RTP) Class described in [RFC5127].

1.1.  Definitions

   The following terms and acronyms are used in this document.

   PHB:  A Per-Hop-Behavior (PHB) is the externally observable
      forwarding behavior applied at a Differentiated Services 
      compliant node to a DS behavior aggregate [RFC2475].  It may be 
      thought of as a program configured on the interface of an 
      Internet host or router, specified in terms of drop 
      probabilities, queuing priorities or rates, and other handling 
      characteristics for the traffic class.

   DSCP:  The Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP), as defined in
      [RFC2474], is a value which is encoded in the DS field, and which
      each DS Node MUST use to select the PHB which is to be 
      experienced by each packet it forwards [RFC3260].  It is a 6-bit 
      number embedded into the 8-bit TOS field of an IPv4 datagram or 
      the Traffic Class field of an IPv6 datagram.

   CAC:  Call Admission Control includes concepts of authorization and
      capacity admission.  "Authorization" refers to any procedure that
      identifies a user, verifies the authenticity of the
      identification, and determines whether the user is authorized to
      use the service under the relevant policy.  "Capacity Admission"
      refers to any procedure that determines whether capacity exists
      supporting a session's requirements under some policy.

      In the Internet, these are separate functions, while in the PSTN
      they and call routing are carried out together.

   UNI:  A User/Network Interface (UNI) is the interface (often a
      physical link or its virtual equivalent) that connects two
      entities that do not trust each other, and in which one (the 
      user) purchases connectivity services from the other (the 
      network).

      Figure 1 shows two user networks connected by what appears to 
      each of them to be a single network ("The Internet", access to 
      which is provided by their service provider) that provides 
      connectivity services to other users.



Baker, et al.             Expires Sept 8, 2010                 [Page 4]
Internet-Draft     DSCP for Capacity-Admitted Traffic        March 2010

      UNIs tend to be the bottlenecks in the Internet, where users
      purchase relatively low amounts of bandwidth for cost or service
      reasons, and as a result are most subject to congestion issues 
      and therefore issues requiring traffic conditioning and service 
      prioritization.

   NNI:  A Network/Network Interface (NNI) is the interface (often a
      physical link or its virtual equivalent) that connects two
      entities that trust each other within limits, and in which the 
      two are seen as trading services for value.  Figure 1 shows three
      service networks that together provide the connectivity services 
      that we call "the Internet".  They are different administrations 
      and are very probably in competition, but exchange contracts for 
      connectivity and capacity that enable them to offer specific 
      services to their customers.

      NNIs may not be bottlenecks in the Internet if service providers
      contractually agree to provision excess capacity at them, as they
      commonly do.  However, NNI performance may differ by ISP, and the
      performance guarantee interval may range from a month to a much
      shorter period.  Furthermore, a peering point NNI may not have
      contractual performance guarantees or may become overloaded under
      certain conditions.  They are also policy-controlled interfaces,
      especially in BGP.  As a result, they may require traffic
      prioritization policy.

   Queue:  There are multiple ways to build a multi-queue scheduler.
      Weighted Round Robin (WRR) literally builds multiple lists and
      visits them in a specified order, while a calendar queue (often
      used to implement Weighted Fair Queuing, or WFQ) builds a list 
      for each time interval and queues at most a stated amount of data
      in each such list for transmission during that time interval.  
      While these differ dramatically in implementation, the external 
      difference in behavior is generally negligible when they are 
      properly configured.  Consistent with the definitions used in the
      Differentiated Services Architecture [RFC2475], these are treated
      as equivalent in this document, and the lists of WRR and the 
      classes of a calendar queue will be referred to uniformly as 
      "queues".

1.2.  Problem

   In short, the Telephony Service Class described in [RFC4594] permits
   the use of capacity admission in implementing the service, but
   present implementations either provide no capacity admission 
   services or do so in a manner that depends on specific traffic 
   engineering. In the context of the Internet backbone, the two are 
   essentially equivalent; the edge network depends on specific 
   engineering by the service provider that might not be present, 
   especially in a mobile environment.

   However, services are being requested of the network that would
   specifically make use of capacity admission, and would distinguish
   among users or the uses of available Voice-over-IP or Video-over-IP
   capacity in various ways.  Various agencies would like to provide
   services as described in section 2.6 of [RFC4504] or in [RFC4190].

   This requires the use of capacity admission to differentiate among

   users to provide services to them that are not afforded to 
   non-capacity admitted customer-to-customer IP telephony sessions.


2.  Candidate Implementations of the Admitted Telephony Service Class

2.1.  Potential implementations of EF in this model

   There are at least two possible ways to implement isolation between
   the Capacity Admitted PHB and the Expedited Forwarding PHB in this
   model.  They are to implement separate classes as a set of

   o  Multiple data plane traffic classes, each consisting of a policer
      and a queue, and the queues enjoying different priorities, or

   o  Multiple data plane traffic classes, each consisting of a policer
      but feeding into a common queue or multiple queues at the same
      priority.

   We will explain the difference, and describe in what way they differ
   in operation.  The reason this is necessary is that there is current
   confusion in the industry.

   The multi-priority model is shown in Figure 2.  In this model,
   traffic from each service class is placed into a separate priority
   queue.  If data is present in more than one queue, traffic from one 
   of them will always be selected for transmission.  This has the 
   effect of transferring jitter from the higher priority queue to the 
   lower priority queues, and reordering traffic in a way that gives 
   the higher priority traffic a smaller average queuing delay.  Each 
   queue must have its own policer, however, to protect the network 
   from errors and attacks; if a traffic class thinks it is carrying a 
   certain data rate but an abuse sends significantly more, the effect 
   of simple prioritization would not preserve the lower priorities of 
   traffic, which could cause routing to fail or otherwise impact an 
   SLA.

             Figure 2: Implementation as a data plane priority

   The multi-policer model is shown in Figure 3.  In this model, 
   traffic from each service class is policed according to its SLA 
   requirements, and then placed into a common priority queue.  Unlike 
   the multi-priority model, the jitter experienced by the traffic 
   classes in this case is the same, as there is only one queue, but 
   the sum of the traffic in this higher priority queue experiences 
   less average jitter than the elastic traffic in the lower priority.

             Figure 3: Implementation as a data plane policer

   The difference between the two operationally is, as stated, the
   issues of loss due to policing and distribution of jitter.

   If the two traffic classes are, for example, voice and video,
   datagrams containing video data can be relatively large (often of
   variable sizes up to the path MTU) while datagrams containing voice
   are relatively small, on the order of only 40 to 200 bytes, 
   depending on the codec.  On lower speed links (less than 10 MBPS), 
   the jitter introduced by video to voice can be disruptive, while at 
   higher speeds the jitter is nominal compared to the jitter 
   requirements of voice.  At access network speeds, therefore, 
   [RFC4594] recommends separation of video and voice into separate 
   queues, while at optical speeds [RFC5127] recommends that they use a
   common queue.

   If, on the other hand, the two traffic classes are carrying the same
   type of application with the same jitter requirements, then giving
   one preference in this sense does not benefit the higher priority
   traffic and may harm the lower priority traffic.  In such a case,
   using separate policers and a common queue is a superior approach.


2.2.  Capacity admission control

   There are at least six major ways that capacity admission is done or
   has been proposed to be done for real-time applications.  Each will 
   be described below, then Section 3 will judge which ones are likely 


Baker, et al.             Expires Sept 8, 2010                 [Page 8]
Internet-Draft     DSCP for Capacity-Admitted Traffic        March 2010

   to meet the requirements of the Admitted Telephony service class. 
   These include:

   o  Drop Precedence used to force sessions to voluntarily exit,

   o  Capacity admission control by assumption or engineering,

   o  Capacity admission control by call counting,

   o  End-point capacity admission performed by probing the network,

   o  Centralized capacity admission control via bandwidth broker, and

   o  Distributed capacity admission control using protocols such as
      RSVP or NSIS.

   The problem with dropping traffic to force users to hang up is that
   it affects a broad class of users - if there is capacity for N calls
   and the N+1 calls are active, data is dropped randomly from all
   sessions to ensure that offered load doesn't exceed capacity.  On
   very fast links, that is acceptable, but on lower speed links it can
   seriously affect call quality. There is also a behavioral issue 
   involved here, in which users who experience poor quality calls tend
   to hang up and call again, making the problem better - then worse.

   The problem with capacity admission by assumption, which is widely
   deployed in today's VoIP environment, is that it depends on the
   assumptions made.  One can do careful traffic engineering to ensure
   needed bandwidth, but this can also be painful, and has to be
   revisited when the network is changed or network usage changes.

   The problem with call counting based admission control is it gets 
   exponentially worse the farther you get from the control point 
   (e.g., it lacks sufficient scalability out into the network).

   There are two fundamental problems with depending on the endpoint to
   perform capacity admission; it may not be able to accurately measure
   the impact of the traffic it generates on the network, and it tends
   to be greedy (e.g., it doesn't care).  If the network operator is
   providing a service, he must be able to guarantee the service, which
   means that he cannot trust systems that are not controlled by his
   network.

   The problem with capacity controls via a bandwidth broker is 
   centralized servers lack far away awareness, and also lack effective
   real-time reaction to dynamic changes in all part of the network
   at all instances of time.

   The problem with mechanisms that do not enable the association of a
   policy with the request is that they do not allow for multi-policy
   services, which are becoming important.



Baker, et al.             Expires Sept 8, 2010                 [Page 9]
Internet-Draft     DSCP for Capacity-Admitted Traffic        March 2010

   The operator's choice of admission procedure MUST, for this DSCP,
   ensure the following:

   o  The actual links that a session uses have enough bandwidth to
      support it.

   o  New sessions are refused admission if there is inadequate
      bandwidth under the relevant policy.

   o  If multiple policies are in use in a network, that the user is
      identified and the correct policy applied.

   o  Under periods of network stress, the process of admission of new
      sessions does not disrupt existing sessions, unless the service
      explicitly allows for disruption of calls.

2.3.  Recommendations on implementation of an Admitted Telephony 
      Service Class

   When coupled with adequate AAA and capacity admission procedures as 
   described in Section 2.2, either of the two PHB implementations 
   described in Section 2.1 is sufficient to provide the services 
   required for an Admitted Telephony service class.  If preemption is 
   required, as described in section 2.3.5.2 of [RFC4542], this 
   provides the tools for carrying out the preemption. If preemption is 
   not in view, or if used in addition to preemptive services, the 
   application of different thresholds depending on call precedence has 
   the effect of improving the probability of call completion by 
   admitting preferred calls at a time that other calls are being 
   refused.  Routine and priority traffic can be admitted using the 
   same DSCP value, as the choice of which calls are admitted is 
   handled in the admission procedure executed in the control plane, 
   not the policing of the data plane.

   On the point of what protocols and procedures are required for
   authentication, authorization, and capacity admission, we note that
   clear standards do not exist at this time for bandwidth brokers, 
   NSIS has not been finalized at this time and in any event is limited
   to unicast sessions, and that RSVP has been standardized and has the
   relevant services.  We therefore RECOMMEND the use of a protocol, 
   such as RSVP, at the UNI.  Procedures at the NNI are business 
   matters to be discussed between the relevant networks, and are 
 I RECOMMENDED but NOT REQUIRED.



3.  Summary: changes from RFC 4594

   To summarize, there are two changes to [RFC4594] discussed in this
   document:

   Telephony class:  The Telephony Service Class in RFC 4594 does not


Baker, et al.             Expires Sept 8, 2010                [Page 10]
Internet-Draft     DSCP for Capacity-Admitted Traffic        March 2010

      involve capacity admission, but depends on application layer
      admission that only estimates capacity, and that through static
      engineering.  In addition to that class, a separate Admitted
      Telephony Class is added which performs capacity admission
      dynamically.

   Video classes:  Capacity admission is added to three video classes.
      These are the Interactive Real-Time Traffic class, Broadcast TV
      class when used for video on demand, and the Multimedia
      Conferencing class.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This note requests that IANA assign a DSCP value to a second EF
   traffic class consistent with [RFC3246] and [RFC3247] in the
   "Differentiated Services Field Codepoints" registry.  It implements
   the Telephony Service Class described in [RFC4594] at lower speeds
   and is included in the Real Time Treatment Aggregate [RFC5127] at 
   higher speeds.  The recommended code point value should be from pool
   1 within the dscp-registry. This document RECOMMENDS retaining a 
   parallel with the existing EF code point (101110) by assigning a 
   value for the code point of 101100 -- keeping the (left to right) 
   first 4 binary values the same in both.  The code point described 
   within this document should be referred to as VOICE-ADMIT.  Here is 
   the recommended addition to the Pool 1 Codepoint registry:

   Sub-registry: Pool 1 Codepoints 
   Reference: [RFC2474]
   Registration Procedures: Standards Action

      Registry:
      Name         Space    Reference
      ---------    -------  ---------
      VOICE-ADMIT  101100   [this document]

   This traffic class REQUIRES the use of capacity admission, such as
   RSVP services together with AAA services, at the User/Network
   Interface (UNI); the use of such services at the NNI is at the 
   option of the interconnected networks.


5.  Security Considerations

   A major requirement of this service is effective use of a signaling
   Protocol, such as RSVP, with the capabilities to identify its user
   either as an individual or as a member of some corporate entity, and
   assert a policy such as "normal", "routine" or some level of 
   "priority".

   This capability, one has to believe, will be abused by script 
   kiddies and others if the proof of identity is not adequately strong


Baker, et al.             Expires Sept 8, 2010                [Page 11]
Internet-Draft     DSCP for Capacity-Admitted Traffic        March 2010

   or if policies are written or implemented improperly by the 
   carriers.  This goes without saying, but this section is here for it
   to be said...

   Much of the security considerations from RFC 3246 [RFC3246] applies 
   to this document, as well as the security considerations in RFC 
   2474 and RFC 4542. RFC 4230 [RFC4230] analyzes RSVP, providing some 
   gap analysis to the NSIS WG as they started their work. Keep in mind
   that this document is advocating RSVP at the UNI only, while RFC 
   4230 discusses (mostly) RSVP from a more complete point of view  
   (i.e., e2e and edge2edge). When considering the RSVP aspect of this 
   document, understanding Section 6 of RFC 4230 is a good source of 
   information.

Abstract

   The Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) can be used to make end-to-
   end resource reservations in an IP network in order to guarantee the
   quality of service required by certain flows.  RSVP assumes that both
   the data sender and receiver of a given flow take part in RSVP
   signaling.  Yet, there are use cases where resource reservation is
   required, but the receiver, the sender, or both, is not RSVP-capable.
   This document presents RSVP Proxy behaviors allowing RSVP routers to
   initiate or terminate RSVP signaling on behalf of a receiver or a
   sender that is not RSVP-capable.  This allows resource reservations
   to be established on a critical subset of the end-to-end path.  This
   document reviews conceptual approaches for deploying RSVP Proxies and
   discusses how RSVP reservations can be synchronized with application
   requirements, despite the sender, receiver, or both not participating
   in RSVP.  This document also points out where extensions to RSVP (or
   to other protocols) may be needed for deployment of a given RSVP
   Proxy approach.  However, such extensions are outside the scope of
   this document.  Finally, practical use cases for RSVP Proxy are
   described.

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches               March 2010


1.  Introduction

   Guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) for some applications with tight
   requirements (such as voice or video) may be achieved by reserving
   resources in each node on the end-to-end path.  The main IETF
   protocol for these resource reservations is RSVP, specified in
   [RFC2205].  RSVP does not require that all intermediate nodes support
   RSVP, however it assumes that both the sender and the receiver of the
   data flow support RSVP.  There are environments where it would be
   useful to be able to reserve resources for a flow on at least a
   subset of the flow path even when the sender or the receiver (or
   both) is not RSVP (for example from the sender to the network edge,
   or from edge to edge, or from the network edge to the receiver).

   Since the data sender or receiver may be unaware of RSVP, there are
   two types of RSVP Proxies.  When the sender is not using RSVP, an
   entity in the network must operate on behalf of the data sender, and
   in particular, generate RSVP Path messages, and eventually receive,
   process and sink Resv messages.  We refer to this entity as the RSVP
   Sender Proxy.  When the receiver is not using RSVP, an entity in the
   network must receive Path messages sent by a data sender (or by an
   RSVP Sender Proxy), sink those, and return Resv messages on behalf of
   the data receiver(s).  We refer to this entity as the RSVP Receiver
   Proxy.  The RSVP Proxies need to be on the data path in order to
   establish the RSVP reservation; Note, however, that some of the
   approaches described in this document allow the RSVP Proxies to be
   controlled/triggered by an off-path entity.

   The flow sender and receiver generally have at least some (if not
   full) awareness of the application producing or consuming that flow.
   Hence, the sender and receiver are in a natural position to
   synchronize the establishment, maintenance and tear down of the RSVP
   reservation with the application requirements.  Similarly they are in
   a natural position to determine the characteristics of the
   reservation (bandwidth, QoS service,...) which best match the
   application requirements.  For example, before completing the
   establishment of a multimedia session, the endpoints may decide to
   establish RSVP reservations for the corresponding flows.  Similarly,
   when the multimedia session is torn down, the endpoints may decide to
   tear down the corresponding RSVP reservations.  For instance,
   [RFC3312] discusses how RSVP reservations can be very tightly
   synchronized by endpoints that uses the [RFC3261] Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) for session control.

   When RSVP reservation establishment, maintenance and tearing down is
   to be handled by RSVP Proxies on behalf of an RSVP sender or
   receiver, a key challenge for the RSVP Proxy is to determine when the
   RSVP reservations need to be established, maintained and torn down

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches               March 2010


   and to determine what are the characteristics (bandwidth, QoS
   Service,...) of the required RSVP reservations matching the
   application requirements.  We refer to this problem as the
   synchronization of RSVP reservations with application level
   requirements.

   The IETF Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) working group is specifying a
   new QoS signaling protocol: the QoS NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol
   (NSLP) ([I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp]).  This protocol also includes the
   notion of proxy operation, and terminating QoS signaling on nodes
   that are not the actual data senders or receivers (see section "4.8
   Proxy Mode" of [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp].  This is the same concept as
   the proxy operation for RSVP discussed in this document.  One
   difference though is that the NSIS framework does not consider
   multicast resource reservations, which RSVP provides today.

   Section 2 introduces the notion of RSVP Sender Proxy and RSVP
   Receiver Proxy.  Section 3 defines useful terminology.  Section 4
   then presents several fundamental RSVP Proxy approaches discussing
   how they achieve the necessary synchronization of RSVP reservations
   with application level requirements.  Appendix A includes more
   detailed use cases for the proxies in various real life deployment
   environments.

   It is important to keep in mind that the strongly recommended RSVP
   deployment model remains end to end as assumed in [RFC2205] with RSVP
   support on the sender and the receiver.  The end to end model allows
   the most effective synchronization between the reservation and
   application requirements.  Also, when compared to the end to end RSVP
   model, the use of RSVP Proxies involves additional operational burden
   and/or impose some topological constraints.  The additional
   operational burden comes in particular from additional configuration
   needed to activate the RSVP Proxies and to help them identify for
   which senders/receivers a Proxy behavior is required and for which
   senders/receivers it is not (so that an RSVP Proxy does not perform
   establishment of reservations on behalf of devices that are capable
   of doing so themselves but would then be prevented -without
   notification- from doing so by the RSVP Proxy).  The additional
   topological constraints come in particular from the requirement to
   have one RSVP Receiver Proxy on the path from any sender to every
   non-RSVP capable device (so that a non-RSVP capable device is always
   taken care of by an RSVP Proxy) and the objective to have only one
   such Receiver Proxy on the path from any sender to every non-RSVP
   capable device (so that an RSVP Receiver Proxy does not short-circuit
   another RSVP Receiver Proxy closer to the non-RSVP capable device,
   thereby reducing the span of the RSVP reservation and the associated
   benefits).  In the case of the Path-triggered Receiver Proxy
   approach, the operational burden and topological constraints can be

   significantly alleviated using the mechanisms discussed in
   Section 4.1.1.

   It is also worth noting that RSVP operations on endsystems is
   considerably simpler than on a router, and consequently that RSVP
   implementations on endsystems are very lightweight (particularly
   considering modern endsystems capabilities, including mobile and
   portable devices).  For example, endsystem RSVP implementations are
   reported to only consume low tens of kilobytes of code space.  Hence,
   the present document should not be seen as an encouragement to depart
   from the end to end RSVP model.  Its purpose is only to allow RSVP
   deployment in special environments where RSVP just cannot be used on
   some senders and/or some receivers for reasons specific to the
   environment.


2.  RSVP Proxy Behaviors

   This section discusses the two types of proxies; the RSVP Sender
   Proxy operating on behalf of data senders, and the RSVP Receiver
   Proxy operating for data receivers.  The concepts presented in this
   document are not meant to deprecate the traditional [RFC2205] RSVP
   end-to-end model: end-to-end RSVP reservations are still expected to
   be used whenever possible.  However, RSVP Proxies are intended to
   facilitate RSVP deployment where end-to-end RSVP signaling is not
   possible.

2.1.  RSVP Receiver Proxy

   With conventional end-to-end RSVP operations, RSVP reservations are
   controlled by receivers of data.  After a data sender has sent an
   RSVP Path message towards the intended recipient(s), each recipient
   that requires a reservation generates a Resv message.  If, however, a
   data receiver is not running the RSVP protocol, the last hop RSVP
   router will still send the Path message to the data receiver, which
   will silently drop this message as an IP packet with an unknown
   protocol number.

   In order for reservations to be made in such a scenario, one of the
   RSVP routers on the data path determines that the data receiver will
   not be participating in the resource reservation signaling and
   performs RSVP Receiver Proxy functionality on behalf of the data
   receiver.  This is illustrated in Figure 1.  Various mechanisms by
   which the RSVP proxy router can gain the required information are
   discussed later in the document.

2.2.  RSVP Sender Proxy

   With conventional end-to-end RSVP operations, if a data sender is not
   running the RSVP protocol, a resource reservation can not be set up;
   a data receiver can not alone reserve resources without Path messages
   first being received.  Thus, even if the data receiver is running
   RSVP, it still needs some node on the data path to send a Path
   message towards the data receiver.

   In that case, an RSVP node on the data path determines that it should
   generate Path messages to allow the receiver to set up the resource
   reservation.  This node is referred to as the RSVP Sender Proxy and
   is illustrated in Figure 2.  This case presents additional challenges
   over the Receiver Proxy case, since the RSVP Sender Proxy must be
   able to generate all the information in the Path message (such as the
   Sender TSpec) without the benefit of having previously received any
   RSVP message.  An RSVP Receiver Proxy, by contrast only needs to
   formulate an appropriate Resv message in response to an incoming Path
   message.  Mechanisms to operate an RSVP Sender Proxy are discussed
   later in this document.

3.  Terminology

   o  On-Path: located on the datapath of the actual flow of application
      data (regardless of where it is located with respect to the
      application level signaling path).

   o  Off-Path: not On-Path.

   o  RSVP-capable (or RSVP-aware): which supports the RSVP protocol as
      per [RFC2205].

   o  RSVP Receiver Proxy: an RSVP capable router performing, on behalf
      of a receiver, the RSVP operations which would normally be
      performed by an RSVP-capable receiver if end-to-end RSVP signaling
      was used.  Note that while RSVP is used upstream of the RSVP
      Receiver Proxy, RSVP is not used downstream of the RSVP Receiver
      Proxy.

   o  RSVP Sender Proxy: an RSVP capable router performing, on behalf of
      a sender, the RSVP operations which would normally be performed by
      an RSVP-capable sender if end-to-end RSVP signaling was used.
      Note that while RSVP is used downstream of the RSVP Sender Proxy,
      RSVP is not used upstream of the RSVP Sender Proxy.

   o  Regular RSVP Router: an RSVP-capable router which is not behaving
      as a RSVP Receiver Proxy nor as a RSVP Sender Proxy.

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches               March 2010


   o  Application level signaling: signaling between entities operating
      above the IP layer and which are aware of the QoS requirements for
      actual media flows.  SIP ([RFC3261]) and RTSP ([RFC2326]) are
      examples of application level signaling protocol.  SDP ([RFC4566])
      is an example of session description protocol that can be used by
      the application level signaling protocol and from which some of
      the RSVP reservation parameters (addresses, ports and bandwidth)
      might be derived.  RSVP is clearly not an application level
      signaling.

   The roles of RSVP Receiver Proxy, RSVP Sender Proxy, Regular RSVP
   Router are all relative to a given unidirectional flow.  A given
   router may act as the RSVP Receiver Proxy for a flow, as the RSVP
   Sender Proxy for another flow and as a Regular RSVP router for yet
   another flow.

   Some application level signaling protocols support negotiation of QoS
   reservations for a media stream.  For example, with [RFC3312],
   resource reservation requirements are explicitly signaled during
   session establishment using SIP and SDP.  Also, [RFC5432] defines a
   mechanism to negotiate which resource reservation mechanism is to be
   used for a particular media stream.  Clearly, these reservation
   negotiation mechanisms can be invoked and operate effectively when
   both ends support RSVP (and obviously RSVP Proxies are not used).
   When both ends do not support RSVP (and RSVP proxies are used at both
   ends) these mechanisms will simply not be invoked.  In the case where
   one end supports RSVP and the other does not (and is helped by an
   RSVP Proxy), the application level signaling entity supporting the
   non RSVP capable end might use the reservation negotiation mechanisms
   in such a way that the non RSVP capable end (helped by an RSVP Proxy)
   appears to the remote end as an RSVP capable device.  This will
   ensure that the RSVP capable end is not discouraged to use RSVP
   because the remote end is not RSVP capable.  In the case of SIP, the
   application level entity may achieve this by taking advantage of the
   "segmented" Status Type of [RFC3312] and/or by taking advantage of a
   SIP [RFC3261] Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA).


4.  RSVP Proxy Approaches

   This section discusses fundamental RSVP Proxy approaches.

4.1.  Path-Triggered Receiver Proxy

   In this approach, it is assumed that the sender is RSVP capable and
   takes full care of the synchronization between application
   requirements and RSVP reservations.  With this approach, the RSVP
   Receiver Proxy uses the RSVP Path messages generated by the sender as



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires September 9, 2010               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches               March 2010


   the cue for establishing the RSVP reservation on behalf of the
   receiver.  The RSVP Receiver Proxy is effectively acting as a slave
   making reservations (on behalf of the receiver) under the sender's
   control.  This changes somewhat the usual RSVP reservation model
   where reservations are normally controlled by receivers.  Such a
   change greatly facilitates operations in the scenario of interest
   here, which is where the receiver is not RSVP capable.  Indeed it
   allows the RSVP Receiver Proxy to remain application unaware by
   taking advantage of the application awareness and RSVP awareness of
   the sender.

   With the Path-Triggered RSVP Receiver Proxy approach, the RSVP router
   may be configured to use receipt of a regular RSVP Path message as
   the trigger for RSVP Receiver Proxy behavior.

   On receipt of the RSVP Path message, the RSVP Receiver Proxy:

   1.  establishes the RSVP Path state as per regular RSVP processing

   2.  identifies the downstream interface towards the receiver

   3.  sinks the Path message

   4.  behaves as if a Resv message (whose details are discussed below)
       was received on the downstream interface.  This includes
       performing admission control on the downstream interface,
       establishing a Resv state (in case of successful admission
       control) and forwarding the Resv message upstream, sending
       periodic refreshes of the Resv message and tearing down the
       reservation if the Path state is torn down.

   In order to build the Resv message, the RSVP Receiver Proxy can take
   into account information received in the Path message.  For example,
   the RSVP Receiver Proxy may compose a FLOWSPEC object for the Resv
   message which mirrors the SENDER_TSPEC object in the received Path
   message (as an RSVP-capable receiver would typically do).

   Operation of the Path-Triggered Receiver Proxy in the case of a

   In case the reservation establishment is rejected (for example
   because of an admission control failure on a regular RSVP router on
   the path between the RSVP-capable sender and the RSVP Receiver
   Proxy), a ResvErr message will be generated as per conventional RSVP
   operations and will travel downstream towards the RSVP Receiver
   Proxy.  While this ensures that the RSVP Receiver Proxy is aware of
   the reservation failure, conventional RSVP procedures do not cater
   for notification of the sender of the reservation failure.  Operation
   of the Path-Triggered RSVP Receiver Proxy in the case of an admission
   control failure is illustrated in Figure 4.

         Figure 4: Path-Triggered RSVP Receiver Proxy with Failure

   Since, as explained above, in this scenario involving the RSVP
   Receiver Proxy, synchronization between application and RSVP
   reservation is generally performed by the sender, notifying the
   sender of reservation failure is needed.
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-proxy-proto] specifies RSVP extensions allowing
   such sender notification in case of reservation failure in the
   presence of a Path-Triggered RSVP Receiver Proxy.

4.1.1.  Mechanisms for Maximizing the Reservation Span

   The presence in the flow path of a Path-triggered RSVP Receiver Proxy
   (for a given flow) that strictly behaves as described previously
   would cause the Path message to be terminated and a Resv message to
   be generated towards the sender.  When the receiver is indeed not
   RSVP capable and there is no other RSVP Receiver Proxy downstream on
   the flow path, this achieves the best achievable result of
   establishing an RSVP reservation as far downstream as the RSVP
   Receiver Proxy.

   However, if the eventual receiver was in fact RSVP capable, it would
   be prevented from participating in RSVP signalling since it does not

   receive any Path message.  As a result, the RSVP reservation would
   only span a subset of the path it could actually span.  A similar
   suboptimality would exist with multiple Receiver Proxies in the path
   of the flow: the first Receiver Proxy may prevent the Path message
   from reaching the second one and therefore prevent the reservation
   from extending down to the second Receiver Proxy.

   It is desirable that, in the presence of Path-triggered RSVP Receiver
   Proxies and of a mix of RSVP-capable and non-RSVP-capable receivers,
   the RSVP reservation spans as much of the flow path as possible.
   This can be achieved dynamically (avoiding tedious specific
   configuration), using the mechanisms described in Section 4.1.1.1 and
   in Section 4.1.1.2.

4.1.1.1.  Dynamic Discovery of Downstream RSVP Functionality

   When generating a proxy Resv message upstream, a Receiver Proxy may
   be configured to perform dynamic discovery of downstream RSVP
   functionality.  To that end, when generating the proxy Resv message
   upstream, the Receiver Proxy forwards the Path message downstream
   instead of terminating it.  This allows an RSVP capable receiver (or
   a downstream Receiver Proxy) to respond to the Path with an upstream
   Resv message.  On receipt of a Resv message, the Receiver Proxy
   internally converts its state from a proxied reservation to a regular
   midpoint RSVP behavior.  From then on, everything proceeds as if the
   RSVP router had behaved as a regular RSVP router at reservation
   establishment (as opposed to having behaved as an RSVP receiver proxy
   for that flow).

   The RSVP Receiver Proxy behavior for dynamic discovery of downstream
   RSVP functionality is illustrated in Figure 5 and is also discussed
   in section 4.1 of [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-proxy-proto].

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches               March 2010


   This dynamic discovery mechanism has the benefit that new (or
   upgraded) RSVP endpoints will automatically and seamlessly be able to
   take advantage of end-to-end reservations, without impacting the
   ability of a Receiver Proxy to proxy RSVP for other, non-RSVP-capable
   endpoints.  This mechanism also achieves the goal of automatically
   discovering the longest possible RSVP-supporting segment in a network
   with multiple Receiver Proxies along the path.  This mechanism
   dynamically adjusts to any topology and routing change.  Also, this
   mechanism dynamically handles the situation where a receiver was
   RSVP-capable and for some reason (e.g.  Software downgrade) no longer
   is.  Finally, this approach requires no new RSVP protocol extensions
   and no configuration changes to the Receiver Proxy as new RSVP-
   capable endpoints come and go.

   The only identified drawbacks to this approach are:

   o  If admission control fails on the segment between the Receiver
      Proxy and the RSVP-capable receiver, the receiver will get a
      ResvError and can take application-level signalling steps to
      terminate the call.  However, the receiver proxy has already sent
      a Resv upstream for this flow, so the sender will see a "false"
      reservation which is not truly end-to-end.  The actual admission
      control status will resolve itself in a short while, but the
      sender will need to roll back any permanent action (such as
      billing) that may have been taken on receipt of the phantom Resv.
      Note that if the second receiver is also a Receiver Proxy which is
      not participating in application signalling, it will convert the
      received ResvError into a PathError which will be received by the
      sender.

   o  If there is no RSVP-capable receiver (or other Receiver Proxy)
      downstream of the Receiver Proxy, then the Path messages sent by
      the Receiver Proxy every RSVP refresh interval (e.g. 30 seconds by
      default) will never be responded to.  However, these messages
      consume a small amount of bandwidth, and in addition would install
      some RSVP state on RSVP-capable midpoint nodes downstream of the
      first Receiver Proxy.  This is seen as a very minor sub-
      optimality.  We also observe that such resources would be consumed
      anyways if the receiver was RSVP capable.  Still, if deemed
      necessary, to mitigate this, the receiver proxy can tear down any
      unanswered downstream Path state and stop sending Path messages
      for the flow (or only send them at much lower frequency) as
      further discussed in [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-proxy-proto] .

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches               March 2010


4.1.1.2.  Selective Receiver Proxy and Sender Control of Receiver Proxy

   An RSVP Receiver Proxy can be selective about the sessions that it
   terminates, based on local policy decision.  For example, an edge
   router functioning as a Receiver Proxy may behave as a proxy only for
   Path messages that are actually going to exit the domain in question,
   not for Path messages that are transiting through it but stay within
   the domain.  As another example, the receiver proxy may be
   configurable to only proxy for flows addressed to a given destination
   address or destination address ranges (for which end devices are
   known to not be RSVP capable).

   The decision to proxy a Resv for a Path may also be based on
   information signalled from the sender in the Path message.  For
   example, the sender may identify the type of application or flow in
   the Application Identity Policy Element ([RFC2872]) in the Path, and
   the Receiver Proxy may be configured to proxy for only certain types
   of flows.  Or, if the sender knows (for example through application
   signalling) that the receiver is RSVP capable, the sender can include
   an indication in a Policy Element to any Receiver Proxy that it ought
   not to terminate the Path (or conversely, if the receiver is known
   not to support RSVP, the sender could include an indication to
   Receiver Proxies that they ought to generate a proxy Resv message).
   The Receiver Proxy Control Policy Element specified in section 4.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-proxy-proto] can be used for that purpose.

4.2.  Path-Triggered Sender Proxy for Reverse Direction

   In this approach, it is assumed that one endpoint is RSVP capable and
   takes full care of the synchronization between application
   requirements and RSVP reservations.  This endpoint is the sender for
   one flow direction (which we refer to as the "forward" direction) and
   is the receiver for the flow in the opposite direction (which we
   refer to as the "reverse" direction).

   With the Path-Triggered Sender Proxy for Reverse Direction approach,
   the RSVP Proxy uses the RSVP signaling generated by the receiver (for
   the reverse direction) as the cue for initiating RSVP signaling for
   the reservation in the reverse direction.  More precisely, the RSVP
   Proxy can take the creation (respectively, maintenance and teardown)
   of a Path state by the receiver as the cue to create (respectively,
   maintain and teardown) a Path state towards the receiver.  Thus, the
   RSVP Proxy is effectively acting as a Sender Proxy for the reverse
   direction under the control of the receiver (for the reverse
   direction).  Note that this assumes a degree of symmetry for example
   in terms of bandwidth for the two directions of the flow (as is
   currently typical for IP telephony, for example).

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches               March 2010


   The signaling flow for the Path-Triggered Sender Proxy for Reverse
   Direction is illustrated in Figure 6.

   Path messages generated by the receiver need to transit via the RSVP
   Sender Proxy that is on the path from the sender to the receiver.  In
   some topologies, this will always be the case: for example where the
   sender is on a stub network hanging off the RSVP Sender Proxy or
   where there is no asymmetric routing (such that if a RSVP Sender
   Proxy is on the path from receiver to sender, then it is also on the
   path from sender to receiver).  In some topologies (such as those
   involving asymmetric routing), this may not always happen naturally.
   Measures to ensure this does happen in these topologies are outside
   the scope of this document.

   Of course, the RSVP Proxy may simultaneously (and typically will)
   also act as the Path-Triggered Receiver Proxy for the forward
   direction, as defined in Section 4.1.  Such an approach is most
   useful in situations involving RSVP reservations in both directions
   for symmetric flows.  This is illustrated in Figure 7.

             Figure 7: Path Triggered Receiver & Sender Proxy

   With the Path-Triggered Sender Proxy for Reverse Direction approach,
   the RSVP router may be configurable to use receipt of a regular RSVP
   Path message as the trigger for Sender Proxy for Reverse Direction
   behavior.

   On receipt of the RSVP Path message for the forward direction, the
   RSVP Sender Receiver Proxy :

   1.  sinks the Path message

   2.  behaves as if a Path message for reverse direction (whose details
       are discussed below) had been received by the Sender Proxy.  This
       includes establishing the corresponding Path state, forwarding
       the Path message downstream, sending periodic refreshes of the

       Path message and tearing down the Path in reverse direction when
       the Path state in forward direction is torn down.

   In order to build the Path message for the reverse direction, the
   RSVP Sender Proxy can take into account information in the received
   Path message for the forward direction.  For example, the RSVP Sender
   Proxy may mirror the SENDER_TSPEC object in the received Path
   message.

   We observe that this approach does not require any extensions to the
   existing RSVP protocol.

   In the case where reservations are required in both directions (as
   shown in Figure 7), the RSVP-capable device simply needs to behave as
   a regular RSVP sender and RSVP receiver.  It needs not be aware that
   an RSVP Proxy happens to be used and the Path message it sent for the
   forward reservation also acts as the trigger for establishment of the
   reverse reservation.  However, in the case where a reservation is
   only required in the reverse direction (as shown in Figure 6), the
   RSVP-capable device has to generate Path messages in order to trigger
   the reverse direction reservation even if no reservation is required
   in the forward direction.  Although this is not in violation with
   [RFC2205], it may not be the default behavior of an RSVP-capable
   device and therefore may need a behavioral change specifically to
   facilitate operation of the Path-Triggered Sender Proxy for Reverse
   Direction.

4.3.  Inspection-Triggered Proxy

   In this approach, it is assumed that the RSVP Proxy is on the
   datapath of "packets of interest", that it can inspect such packets
   on the fly as they transit through it, and that it can infer
   information from these packets of interest to determine what RSVP
   reservations need to be established, when and with what
   characteristics (possibly also using some configured information).

   One example of "packets of interest" could be application level
   signaling.  An RSVP Proxy capable of inspecting SIP signaling for
   multimedia session or RTSP signaling for Video streaming, can obtain
   from such signaling information about when a multimedia session is up
   or when a Video is going to be streamed.  It can also identify the
   addresses and ports of senders and receivers and can determine the
   bandwidth of the corresponding flows.  It can also determine when the
   reservation is no longer needed and tear it down.  Thus, such an RSVP
   Proxy can determine all necessary information to synchronize RSVP
   reservations to application requirements.  This is illustrated in
   Figure 8.

   Another example of "packets of interest" could be transport control
   messages (e.g.  RTCP [RFC3550]) traveling alongside the application
   flow itself (i.e.  Media packets).  An RSVP Proxy capable of
   detecting the transit of packets from a particular flow, can attempt
   to establish a reservation corresponding to that flow.
   Characteristics of the reservation may be derived by various methods
   such as from configuration, flow measurement or a combination of
   those.  However, these methods usually come with their respective
   operational drawbacks: configuration involves an operational cost and
   may hinder introduction of new applications, measurement is reactive
   so that accurate reservation may lag actual traffic.

   In case of reservation failure, the inspection-triggered RSVP Proxy
   does not have a direct mechanism for notifying the application (since

   that the application is not in a position to take appropriate action
   (for example terminate the corresponding session).  To mitigate this
   problem, the inspection-triggered RSVP Proxy may mark differently the
   Differentiated Services codepoint (DSCP) ([RFC2474]) of flows for
   which an RSVP reservation has been successfully proxied from the
   flows for which a reservation is not in place.  In some situations,
   the Inspection-Triggered Proxy might be able to modify the "packets
   of interest" (e.g.  Application signaling messages) to convey some
   hint to applications that the corresponding flows cannot be
   guaranteed by RSVP reservations.

   With the inspection-triggered Proxy approach, the RSVP Proxy is
   effectively required to attempt to build application awareness by
   traffic inspection and then is somewhat limited in the actions it can
   take in case of reservation failure.  Depending on the "packets of
   interest" used by the RSVP Proxy to trigger the reservation, there is
   a risk that the RSVP Proxy ends up establishing a reservation for a
   media flow that actually never starts.  However, this can be
   mitigated by timing out and tearing down of an unnecessary
   reservation by the RSVP Proxy when no corresponding media flow is
   observed.  This flow observation and time out approach can also be
   used to tear down reservation that were rightfully established for a
   flow but are no longer needed because the flow stopped.

   The inspection-triggered approach is also subject to the general
   limitations associated with data inspection.  This includes being
   impeded by encryption or tunnelling, or being dependent on some
   topology constraints such as relying on the fact that both the
   packets of interest and the corresponding flow packets always transit
   through the same RSVP Proxy.

   Nonetheless, this may be a useful approach in specific environments.
   Note also that this approach does not require any change to the RSVP
   protocol.

   With the "Inspection-Triggered" RSVP Proxy approach, the RSVP router
   may be configurable to use and interpret some specific "packets of
   interest" as the trigger for RSVP Receiver Proxy behavior.

   When operating off signaling traffic, the "Inspection-Triggered" RSVP
   Proxy may be able to detect from the signaling that the endpoint is
   capable of establishing an RSVP reservation (e.g.  In the case of SIP
   via inspection of the [RFC3312]/[RFC4032] Precondition), in which
   case it would not behave as a Proxy for that endpoint .  Also, the
   "Inspection-Triggered" RSVP proxy may inspect RSVP signaling and if
   it sees RSVP signaling for the flow of interest, it can disable its
   sender proxy behavior for that flow (or that sender).  Optionally,
   through RSVP signaling inspection, the sender proxy might also

   gradually "learn" (possibly with some timeout) which sender is RSVP
   capable of not.  These mechanisms can facilitate gradual and dynamic
   migration from the Proxy model towards the end-to-end RSVP model as
   more and more endpoints become RSVP capable.

4.4.  STUN-Triggered Proxy

   In this approach, the RSVP Proxy takes advantage of the application
   awareness provided by the STUN ([RFC5389]) signaling to synchronize
   RSVP reservations with application requirements.  The STUN signaling
   is sent from endpoint to endpoint.  This is illustrated in Figure 9.
   In this approach, a STUN message triggers the RSVP Proxy.

   For unicast flows, [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice] is a widely-adopted approach
   for NAT traversal.  For our purposes of triggering RSVP Proxy
   behavior, we rely on ICE's connectivity check which is based on the
   exchange of STUN Binding Request messages between hosts to verify
   connectivity (see section 2.2 of [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice]).  The STUN
   message could also include (yet to be specified) STUN attributes to
   indicate information such as the bandwidth and application requesting
   the flow, which would allow the RSVP proxy agent to create an
   appropriately-sized reservation for each flow.  Including such new

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches               March 2010


   STUN attributes in the ICE connectivity check messages would
   facilitates operation of the RSVP Proxy.  To ensure RSVP reservations
   are only established when needed, the RSVP Proxy needs to
   distinguish, among all the STUN messages, the ones that reflect (with
   high likelihood) an actual upcoming media flow.  This can be achieved
   by identifying the STUN messages associated with an ICE connectivity
   check.  In turn, this can be achieved through (some combination of)
   the following checks:

   o  if, as discussed above, new STUN attributes (e.g.  Conveying the
      flow bandwidth) are indeed defined in the future in view of
      facilitating STUN-Triggered reservations, then the presence of
      these attributes would reveal that the STUN message is part of an
      ICE connectivity check.

   o  the presence of the PRIORITY, USE-CANDIDATE, ICE-CONTROLLED or
      ICE-CONTROLLING attributes reveals that the STUN message is part
      of an ICE connectivity check

   o  the RSVP Proxy may wait for a STUN message containing the USE-
      CANDIDATE attribute indicating the selected ICE "path" to trigger
      reservation only for the selected "path".  This allows the RSVP
      Proxy to only trigger a reservation for the "path" actually
      selected and therefore for the media flow that will actually be
      established (for example when ICE is being used for v4/v6 path
      selection).

   o  the RSVP Proxy configuration could contain some information
      facilitating determination of when to perform RSVP Proxy
      reservation and not.  For example, the RSVP Proxy configuration
      could contain the IP addresses of the STUN servers such that STUN
      messages to/from those addresses are known to not be part of an
      ICE connectivity check.  As another example, the RSVP Proxy
      configuration could contain information identifying the set of
      Differentiated Services codepoint (DSCP) values that the media
      flows requiring reservation use, so that STUN messages not using
      one of these DSCP values are known to not be part of an ICE
      connectivity check.

   Despite these checks, there is always a potential risk that the RSVP
   Proxy ends up establishing a reservation for a media flow that
   actually never starts.  However, this is limited to situations where
   the end-systems is interested enough in establishing connectivity for
   a flow but yet never transmit.  Also, this can be mitigated by timing
   out and tear down of an unnecessary reservations by the RSVP Proxy
   when no corresponding media flow is observed.

   The RSVP Proxy agent can inform endpoints of an RSVP reservation

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches               March 2010


   failure implicitly by dropping the ICE connectivity check message or
   explicitly by sending ICMP messages back to the endpoint.  This
   allows reasonably effective synchronisation between RSVP reservations
   handled by the RSVP Proxies and the application running on non RSVP-
   capable endpoints.  It also has the benefits of operating through
   NATs.

   For multicast flows (or certain kinds of unicast flows that don't or
   can't use ICE), a STUN Indication message [RFC5389] could be used to
   carry the (yet to be defined) STUN attributes mentioned earlier to
   indicate the flow bandwidth, thereby providing a benefit similar to
   the ICE connectivity check.  STUN Indication messages are not
   acknowledged by the receiver and have the same scalability as the
   underlying multicast flow.

   The corresponding extensions to ICE and STUN for such a STUN-
   triggered RSVP Proxy approach are beyond the scope of this document.
   They may be defined in the future in a separate document.  As the
   STUN-triggered RSVP Proxy approach uses STUN in a way (i.e.  To
   trigger reservations) that is beyond its initial intended purpose,
   the potential security implications need to be considered by the
   operator.

   ICE connectivity checks is not always used for all flows.  When the
   STUN-triggered RSVP Proxy approach is used, it can establish RSVP
   reservations for flows for which ICE connectivity is performed.
   However, the STUN-triggered RSVP Proxy will not establish a
   reservation for flows for which ICE connectivity check is not
   performed.  Those flows will either not benefit from an RSVP
   reservation or can benefit from an RSVP reservation established
   through other means (end-to-end RSVP, other forms of RSVP Proxy).

   The STUN-triggered approach relies on interception and inspection of
   STUN messages.  Thus, this approach may be impeded by encryption or
   tunneling.

4.5.  Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy

   In this approach, it is assumed that an entity involved in the
   application level signaling controls an RSVP Proxy which is located
   in the datapath of the application flows (i.e. "on-path").  With this
   approach, the RSVP Proxy does not attempt to determine itself the
   application reservation requirements.  Instead the RSVP Proxy is
   instructed by the entity participating in application level signaling
   to establish, maintain and tear down reservations as needed by the
   application flows.  In other words, with this approach, the solution
   for synchronizing RSVP signaling with application level requirements
   is to rely on an application-level signaling entity that controls an

   RSVP Proxy function that sits in the flow datapath.  This approach
   allows control of an RSVP Sender Proxy, an RSVP Receiver Proxy or
   both.

   Operation of the Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy is illustrated
   in Figure 10.

              Figure 10: Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy

   As an example, the Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy may be used in
   the context of SIP Servers ([RFC3261]) or Session Border Controllers
   (SBCs) (see [I-D.ietf-sipping-sbc-funcs] for description of SBCs) to
   establish RSVP reservations for multimedia sessions.  In that case,

   the Application Entity may be the signaling component of the SBC.

   This RSVP Proxy approach does not require any extension to the RSVP
   protocol.  However, it relies on an RSVP Proxy control interface
   allowing control of the RSVP Proxy by an application signaling
   entity.  This RSVP Proxy control interface is beyond the scope of the
   present document.  Candidate protocols for realizing such interface
   include the IETF NETCONF configuration protocol
   ([RFC4741],[RFC5277]), Web Services protocol ([W3C]), QPIM
   ([RFC3644]) and DIAMETER ([RFC3588]).  This interface can rely on
   soft states or hard states.  Clearly, when hard states are used,
   those need to be converted appropriately by the RSVP Proxy entities
   into the corresponding RSVP soft states.  As an example,
   [I-D.ietf-dime-diameter-qos] is intended to allow control of RSVP
   Proxy via DIAMETER.

   In general, the Application Entity is not expected to maintain
   awareness of which RSVP Receiver Proxy is on the path to which
   destination.  However, in the particular cases where it does so
   reliably, we observe that the Application Entity could control the
   RSVP Sender Proxy and Receiver Proxy so that aggregate RSVP
   reservations are used between those, instead of one reservation per
   flow.  For example, these aggregate reservations could be of RSVP-
   AGGREGATE type as specified in [RFC3175] or of GENERIC-AGGREGATE type
   as specified in [RFC4860].  Such aggregate reservations could be used
   so that a single reservation can be used for multiple (possibly all)
   application flows transiting via the same RSVP Sender Proxy and the
   same RSVP Receiver Proxy.

   For situations where only the RSVP Sender Proxy has to be controlled
   by this interface, the interface may be realized through the simple
   use of RSVP itself, over a GRE tunnel from the application entity to
   the RSVP Sender Proxy.  This particular case is further discussed in
   Section 4.5.1.  Another particular case of interest is where the
   application signaling entity resides on the same device as the RSVP
   Proxy.  In that case, this interface may be trivially realized as an
   internal API.  An example environment based on this particular case
   is illustrated in Section 4.5.2.

   The application entity controlling the RSVP Proxy (e.g. a SIP Call
   Agent) would often be aware of a number of endpoint capabilities and
   it has to be aware about which endpoint can be best "served" by which
   RSVP Proxy anyways.  So it is reasonable to assume that such an
   application is aware of whether a given endpoint is RSVP-capable or
   not.  The application may also consider the QoS preconditions and QoS
   mechanisms signaled by an endpoint as per [RFC3312]/[RFC4032] and
   [RFC5432].  The information about endpoint RSVP capability can then
   be used by the application to decide whether to trigger Proxy

   behavior or not for a given endpoint.  This can facilitate gradual
   and dynamic migration from the Proxy model towards the end-to-end
   RSVP model as more and more endpoints become RSVP capable.

   In some environments, the application entities (e.g.  SIP Back-to-
   Back User Agents) that need to control the RSVP Proxies would already
   be deployed independently of the use, or not, of the
   Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy approach.  In this case, the
   activation of the RSVP Proxy approach should not introduce
   significant disruption in the application signaling path.  In some
   environments, additional application entities may need to be deployed
   to control the RSVP Proxies.  In this case, the network operator
   needs to consider the associated risks of disruption to the
   application signaling path.

4.5.1.  Application_Entity-Controlled Sender Proxy using "RSVP over GRE"

   This approach is simply a particular case of the more general
   Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy, but where only RSVP Sender
   Proxies need to be controlled by the application, and where RSVP is
   effectively used as the control protocol between the application
   signaling entity and the RSVP Sender Proxy.

   In this approach, the RSVP messages (e.g.  RSVP Path message) are
   effectively generated by the application entity and logically
   "tunnelled" to the RSVP Sender Proxy via GRE tunneling.  This is to
   ensure that the RSVP messages follow the exact same path as the flow
   they protect (as required by RSVP operations) on the segment of the
   end-to-end path which is to be subject to RSVP reservations.

   Figure 11 illustrates such an environment.

   With the Application_Entity-Controlled Sender Proxy using "RSVP Over

   o  generates a Path message on behalf of the sender, corresponding to
      the reservation needed by the application and maintains the
      corresponding Path state.  The Path message built by the

      actual sender (if it was RSVP-capable), with one single exception
      which is that the Application Entity puts its own IP address as
      the RSVP Previous Hop. In particular, it is recommended that the

      source address of the Path message built by the application entity
      be set to the IP address of the sender (not of the application
      entity).  This helps ensuring that, in the presence of non-RSVP
      routers and of load-balancing in the network where the load-
      balancing algorithm takes into account the source IP address, the
      Path message generated by the application entity follows the exact
      same path that the actual stream sourced by the sender.

   o  encapsulates the Path message into a GRE tunnel whose destination
      address is the RSVP Sender Proxy i.e.  An RSVP Router sitting on
      the datapath for the flow (and upstream of the segment which
      requires QoS guarantees via RSVP reservation).

   o  processes the corresponding received RSVP messages (including Resv
      messages) as per regular RSVP.

   o  synchronizes the RSVP reservation state with application level
      requirements and signaling.

   Note that since the application entity encodes its own IP address as
   the previous RSVP hop inside the [RFC2205] RSVP_HOP object of the
   Path message, the RSVP Router terminating the GRE tunnel naturally
   addresses all the RSVP messages travelling upstream hop-by-hop (such
   as Resv messages) to the application entity (without having to
   encapsulate those in a reverse-direction GRE tunnel towards the
   application entity).

4.5.2.  Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy via Co-Location

   This approach is simply a particular case of the more general
   Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy, but where the application entity
   is co-located with the RSVP Proxy.  As an example, Session Border
   Controllers (SBC) with on-board SIP agents could implement RSVP Proxy
   functions and make use of such an approach to achieve session
   admission control over the SBC-to-SBC segment using RSVP signaling.

   Figure 12 illustrates operations of the Application_Entity-Controlled
   RSVP Proxy via Co-location.

   This RSVP Proxy approach does not require any protocol extensions.
   We also observe that when multiple sessions are to be established on
   paths sharing the same RSVP Sender Proxy and the same RSVP Receiver
   Proxy, the RSVP Proxies have the option to establish aggregate RSVP
   reservations (as defined in ([RFC3175] or [RFC4860]) for a group of
   sessions, instead of establishing one RSVP reservation per session.

4.6.  Policy_Server-Controlled Proxy

   In this approach, it is assumed that a Policy Server, which is
   located in the control plane of the network, controls an RSVP Proxy
   which is located in the datapath of the application flows (i.e. "on-
   path").  In turn, the Policy server is triggered by an entity
   involved in the application level signaling.  With this approach, the
   RSVP Proxy does not attempt to determine itself the application
   reservation requirements, but instead is instructed by the Policy
   Server to establish, maintain and tear down reservations as needed by
   the application flows.  Moreover, the entity participating in
   application level signaling does not attempt to understand the
   specific reservation mechanism (i.e.  RSVP) or the topology of the
   network layer, but instead it simply asks the policy server to

   perform (or tear down) a reservation.  In other words, with this
   approach, the solution for synchronizing RSVP signaling with
   application level requirements is to rely on an application level
   entity that controls a policy server that, in turn, controls an RSVP
   Proxy function that sits in the flow datapath.  This approach allows
   control of an RSVP Sender Proxy, an RSVP Receiver Proxy or both.

   Operation of the Policy_Server-Controlled Proxy is illustrated

 //   RSVP Proxy control interface

 I    Interface between Application Entity and Policy Server

                 Figure 13: Policy_Server-Controlled Proxy

   This RSVP Proxy approach does not require any extension to the RSVP
   protocol.  However, as with the Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy
   approach presented in Figure 10, this approach relies on an RSVP
   Proxy control interface allowing control of the RSVP Proxy (by the
   Policy Server in this case).  This RSVP Proxy control interface is
   beyond the scope of the present document.  Considerations about
   candidate protocols for realizing such interface can be found in



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires September 9, 2010              [Page 32]

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches               March 2010


   Section 4.5.  Again, for situations where only the RSVP Sender Proxy
   has to be controlled by this interface, the interface may be realized
   through the simple use of RSVP Itself, over a GRE tunnel from the
   Policy Server to the RSVP Sender Proxy.  This is similar to what is
   presented in Section 4.5.1 except that the "RSVP over GRE" interface
   is used in this case by the Policy Server (instead of the application
   entity).

   The interface between the Application Entity and the Policy Server is
   beyond the scope of this document.

4.7.  RSVP-Signaling-Triggered Proxy

   An RSVP Proxy can also be triggered and controlled through extended
   RSVP signaling from the remote end that is RSVP-capable (and supports
   these RSVP extensions for Proxy control).  For example, an RSVP
   capable sender could send a new or extended RSVP message explicitly
   requesting an RSVP Proxy on the path towards the receiver to behave
   as an RSVP Receiver Proxy and also to trigger a reverse direction
   reservation thus also behaving as a RSVP Sender Proxy.  The new or
   extended RSVP message sent by the sender could also include
   attributes (e.g.  Bandwidth) for the reservations to be signaled by
   the RSVP Proxy.

   The challenges in these explicit signaling schemes include:

   o  How can the nodes determine when a reservation request ought to be
      proxied and when it should not, and accordingly invoke appropriate
      signaling procedures?

   o  How does the node sending the messages explicitly triggering the
      Proxy know where the Proxy is located, e.g., determine an IP
      address of the proxy that should reply to the signaling?

   o  How is all the information needed by a Sender Proxy to generate a
      Path message actually communicated to the Proxy?

   An example of such a mechanism is presented in
   [I-D.manner-tsvwg-rsvp-proxy-sig].  This scheme is primarily targeted
   to local access network reservations whereby an end host can request
   resource reservations for both incoming and outgoing flows only over
   the access network.  This may be useful in environments where the
   access network is typically the bottleneck while the core is
   comparatively over-provisioned, as may be the case with a number of
   radio access technologies.  In this proposal, messages targeted to
   the Proxy are flagged with one bit in all RSVP messages.  Similarly,
   all RSVP messages sent back by the Proxy are also flagged.  The use
   of such a flag allows differentiating between proxied and end-to-end



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires September 9, 2010              [Page 33]

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches               March 2010


   reservations.  For triggering an RSVP Receiver Proxy, the sender of
   the data sends a Path message which is marked with the mentioned
   flag.  The Receiver Proxy is located on the signaling and data path,
   eventually gets the Path message, and replies back with a Resv
   message.  A node triggers an RSVP Sender Proxy with a newly defined
   Path_Request message, which instructs the proxy to send Path messages
   towards the triggering node.  The node then replies back with a Resv.
   More details can be found in [I-D.manner-tsvwg-rsvp-proxy-sig].

   Such an RSVP-Signaling-Triggered Proxy approach would require RSVP
   signaling extensions (that are outside the scope of the present
   document).  However it could provide more flexibility in the control
   of the Proxy behavior (e.g.  Control of reverse reservation
   parameters) than provided by the Path-Triggered approaches defined in
   Section 4.1 and Section 4.2.

   Through potential corresponding protocol extensions, an RSVP-
   Signaling-Triggered Proxy approach could facilitate operation (e.g.
   Reduce or avoid the need for associated configuration) in hybrid
   environments involving both reservations established end-to-end and
   reservations established via RSVP Proxies.  For
   example,[I-D.manner-tsvwg-rsvp-proxy-sig] proposed a mechanism
   allowing an end-system to control whether a reservation can be
   handled by an RSVP Proxy on the path or is to be established end-to-
   end.

4.8.  Reachability Considerations

   There may be situations where the RSVP Receiver Proxy is reachable by
   the sender, while the receiver itself is not.  In such situations, it
   is possible that the RSVP Receiver Proxy is not always aware that the
   receiver is unreachable, and consequently may accept to establish an
   RSVP reservation on behalf of that receiver.  This would result in
   unnecessary reservation establishment and unnecessary network
   resource consumption.

   This is not considered a significant practical concern for a number
   of reasons.  First, in many cases, if the receiver is not reachable
   from the sender, it will not be reachable either for application
   signaling so that application level session establishment will not be
   possible in the first place.  Secondly, where the receiver is
   unreachable from the sender but is reachable for application level
   signaling (say because session establishment is performed through an
   off-path SIP agent that uses a different logical topology to
   communicate with the receiver), then the sender may detect that the
   receiver is unreachable before attempting reservation establishment.
   This may be achieved through mechanisms such as ICE's connectivity
   check ( [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice]).  Finally, even if the sender does not



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires September 9, 2010              [Page 34]

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches               March 2010


   detect that the receiver is unreachable before triggering the RSVP
   reservation establishment, it is very likely that the application
   will quickly realise this lack of connectivity (e.g.  The human
   accepting the phone call on the receiver side will not hear the
   human's voice on the sender side) and therefore tear down the session
   (e.g.  Hang up the phone) which in turn will trigger RSVP reservation
   release.

   Nonetheless, it is recommended that network administrators consider
   the above in light of their particular environment when deploying
   RSVP Proxys.

   The mirror considerations apply for situations involving an RSVP
   Sender Proxy and where the sender cannot reach the destination while
   the RSVP Sender Proxy can.


5.  Security Considerations

   In the environments of concern for this document, RSVP messages are
   used to control resource reservations on a segment of the end-to-end
   path of flows.  The general security considerations associated with
   [RFC2205] apply.  To ensure the integrity of the associated
   reservation and admission control mechanisms, the RSVP cryptographic
   authentication mechanisms defined in [RFC2747]] and [RFC3097] can be
   used.  Those protect RSVP messages integrity hop-by-hop and provide
   node authentication, thereby protecting against corruption, spoofing
   of RSVP messages and replay.
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-security-groupkeying] discusses key types and
   key provisioning methods as well as their respective applicability to
   RSVP authentication.

   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-security-groupkeying] also discusses
   applicability of IPsec mechanisms ([RFC4303], [RFC4303]) and
   associated key provisioning methods for security protection of RSVP.
   This discusion applies to the protection of RSVP in the presence of
   RSVP Proxies as defined in the present document.

   A subset of RSVP messages are signaled with the router alert option
   ([RFC2113],[RFC2711]).  Based on the current security concerns
   associated with the use of the IP router alert option, the
   applicability of RSVP (and therefore of the RSVP Proxy approaches
   discussed in the present document) is limited to controlled
   environments (i.e.  Environments where the security risks associated
   with the use of the router alert option are understood and protected
   against).  The security aspects and common practices around the use
   of the current IP router alert option and consequences of using the
   IP router alert option by applications such as RSVP are discussed in

   details in [I-D.rahman-rtg-router-alert-considerations].

   A number of additional security considerations apply to the use of
   RSVP proxies and are discussed below.

   With some RSVP Proxy approaches, the RSVP proxy operates autonomously
   inside an RSVP router.  This is the case for the Path-Triggered Proxy
   approaches defined in Section 4.1 and in Section 4.2, for the
   Inspection-Triggered Proxy approach defined in Section 4.3, for the
   STUN-Triggered Proxy approach defined in Section 4.4 and for the
   RSVP-Signaling-Triggered approach defined in Section 4.7.  Proper
   reservation operation assumes that the RSVP proxy can be trusted to
   behave correctly in order to control the RSVP reservation as required
   and expected by the end systems.  Since, the basic RSVP operation
   already assumes a trust model where end-systems trust RSVP nodes to
   appropriately perform RSVP reservations, the use of RSVP proxy that
   behave autonomously within an RSVP router is not seen as introducing
   any significant additional security threat or as fundamentally
   modifying the RSVP trust model.

   With some RSVP Proxy approaches, the RSVP proxy operates under the
   control of another entity.  This is the case for the
   Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy approach defined in Section 4.5
   and for the Policy_Server-Controlled Proxy approach defined in
   Section 4.6.  This introduces additional security risks since the
   entity controlling the RSVP Proxy needs to be trusted for proper
   reservation operation and also introduces additional authentication
   and confidentiality requirements.  The exact mechanisms to establish
   such trust, authentication and confidentiality are beyond the scope
   of this document, but they may include security mechanisms inside the
   protocol used as the control interface between the RSVP Proxy and the
   entity controlling it, as well as security mechanisms for all the
   interfaces involved in the reservation control chain (e.g.  Inside
   the application signaling protocol between the end systems and the
   application entity, and, in the case of the Policy_Server-Controlled
   Proxy approach, in the protocol between the application entity and
   the policy server).

   In some situations, the use of RSVP Proxy to control reservations on
   behalf of end-systems may actually reduce the security risk (at least
   from the network operator viewpoint).  This could be the case, for
   example, because the routers where the RSVP Proxy functionality runs
   are less exposed to tampering than end-systems.  Such a case is
   further discussed in section 4 of [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-proxy-proto].
   This could also be the case because the use of RSVP Proxy allows
   localization of RSVP operation within the boundaries of a given
   administrative domain (thus easily operating as a controlled
   environment) while the end-to-end flow path spans multiple

Appendix A.  Use Cases for RSVP Proxies

A.1.  RSVP-based VoD Admission Control in Broadband Aggregation Networks

   As broadband services for residential are becoming more and more
   prevalent, next generation aggregation networks are being deployed in
   order to aggregate traffic from broadband users (whether attached via
   Digital Subscriber Line technology aka DSL, Fiber To The Home/Curb
   aka FTTx, Cable or other broadband access technology).  Video on
   Demand (VoD) services which may be offered to broadband users present
   significant capacity planning challenges for the aggregation network
   for a number of reasons.  First each VoD stream requires significant
   dedicated sustained bandwidth (typically 2-4 Mb/s in Standard
   Definition TV and 6-12 Mb/s in High Definition TV).  Secondly, the
   VoD codec algorithms are very sensitive to packet loss.  Finally, the
   load resulting from such services is very hard to predict (e.g.  It
   can vary very suddenly with block-buster titles made available as
   well as with promotional offerings).  As a result, transport of VoD

   streams on the aggregation network usually translate into a strong
   requirement for admission control.  The admission control solution
   protects the quality of established VoD sessions by rejecting the
   additional excessive session attempts during unpredictable peaks,
   during link or node failures, or combination of those factors.

   RSVP can be used in the aggregation network for admission control of
   the VoD sessions.  However, since Customer Premises equipment such as
   Set Top Boxes (which behave as the receiver for VoD streams) often do
   not support RSVP, the last IP hop in the aggregation network can
   behave as an RSVP Receiver Proxy.  This way, RSVP can be used between
   VoD Pumps and the last IP hop in the Aggregation network to perform
   accurate admission control of VoD streams over the resources set
   aside for VoD in the aggregation network (typically a certain
   percentage of the bandwidth of any link).  As VoD streams are
   unidirectional, a simple "Path-Triggered" RSVP Receiver Proxy (as
   described in Section 4.1) is all that is required in this use case.

   Figure 14 illustrates operation of RSVP-based admission control of
   VoD sessions in an aggregation network involving RSVP support on the
   VoD Pump (the senders) and RSVP Receiver Proxy on the last IP hop of
   the aggregation network.  All the customer premises equipment remain
   RSVP unaware.

   In the case where the VoD Pumps are not RSVP-capable, an
   Application_Entity-Controlled Sender Proxy via "RSVP over GRE"
   approach (as described in Section 4.5.1) can also be implemented on
   the VoD Controller or Session Resource Manager (SRM) devices
   typically involved in VoD deployments.  Figure 15 illustrates

   The RSVP Proxy entities specified in this document play a significant
   role here since they allow immediate deployment of an RSVP-based
   admission control solution for VoD without requiring any upgrade to
   the huge installed base of non-RSVP-capable customer premises
   equipment.  In one mode described above, they also avoid upgrade of
   non-RSVP-capable VoD pumps.  In turn, this means that the benefits of

   on-path admission control can be offered to VoD services over
   broadband aggregation networks without network or VoD Pump upgrade.
   Those include accurate bandwidth accounting regardless of topology
   (hub-and-spoke, ring, mesh, star, arbitrary combinations) and dynamic
   adjustment to any change in topology (such as failure, routing
   change, additional links...).

A.2.  RSVP-based Voice/Video CAC in Enterprise WAN

   More and more enterprises are migrating their telephony and
   videoconferencing applications onto IP.  When doing so, there is a
   need for retaining admission control capabilities of existing TDM-
   based systems to ensure the QoS of these applications is maintained
   even when transiting through the enterprise's Wide Area Network
   (WAN).  Since many of the endpoints already deployed (such as IP
   Phones or Videoconferencing terminals) are not RSVP capable, RSVP
   Proxy approaches are very useful: they allow deployment of an RSVP-
   based admission control solution over the WAN without requiring
   upgrade of the existing terminals.

   A common deployment architecture for such environments relies on the
   Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy approach as defined in
   Section 4.5.  Routers sitting at the edges of the WAN network and
   naturally "on-path" for all inter-campus calls (or sessions) and
   behave as RSVP Proxies.  The RSVP Proxies establish, maintain and
   tear-down RSVP reservations over the WAN segment for the calls (or
   sessions) under the control of the SIP Server/Proxy.  The SIP Server/
   Proxy synchronizes the RSVP reservation status with the status of
   end-to-end calls.  For example, the called IP phone will only be
   instructed to play a ring tone if the RSVP reservations over the
   corresponding WAN segment has been successfully established.

   This architecture allowing RSVP-based admission control of voice and
   video on the Enterprise WAN is illustrated in Figure 16.

A.3.  RSVP Proxies for Mobile Access Networks

   Mobile access networks are increasingly based on IP technology.  This
   implies that, on the network layer, all traffic, both traditional
   data and streamed data like audio or video, is transmitted as
   packets.  Increasingly popular multimedia applications would benefit



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires September 9, 2010              [Page 45]

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches               March 2010


   from better than best-effort service from the network, a forwarding
   service with strict Quality of Service (QoS) with guaranteed minimum
   bandwidth and bounded delay.  Other applications, such as electronic
   commerce, network control and management, and remote login
   applications, would also benefit from a differentiated treatment.

   The IETF has two main models for providing differentiated treatment
   of packets in routers.  The Integrated Services (IntServ) model
   [RFC1633] together with the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)
   [RFC2205] [RFC2210] [RFC2961] provides per-flow guaranteed end-to-end
   transmission service.  The Differentiated Services (DiffServ)
   framework [RFC2475] provides non-signaled flow differentiation that
   usually provides, but does not guarantee, proper transmission
   service.

   However, these architectures have potential weaknesses for deployment
   in Mobile Access Networks.  For example, RSVP requires support from
   both communication end points, and the protocol may have potential
   performance issues in mobile environments.  DiffServ can only provide
   statistical guarantees and is not well suited for dynamic
   environments.

   Let us consider a scenario, where a fixed network correspondent node
   (CN) would be sending a multimedia stream to an end host behind a
   wireless link.  If the correspondent node does not support RSVP it
   cannot signal its traffic characteristics to the network and request
   specific forwarding services.  Likewise, if the correspondent node is
   not able to mark its traffic with a proper Differentiated Services
   codepoint (DSCP) to trigger service differentiation, the multimedia
   stream will get only best-effort service which may result in poor
   visual and audio quality in the receiving application.  Even if the
   connecting wired network is over-provisioned, an end host would still
   benefit from local resource reservations, especially in wireless
   access networks, where the bottleneck resource is most probably the
   wireless link.

   RSVP proxies would be a very beneficial solution to this problem.  It
   would allow distinguishing local network reservations from the end-
   to-end reservations.  The end host does not need to know the access
   network topology or the nodes that will reserve the local resources.
   The access network would do resource reservations for both incoming
   and outgoing flows based on certain criterion, e.g., filters based on
   application protocols.  Another option is that the mobile end host
   makes an explicit reservation that identifies the intention and the
   access network will find the correct local access network node(s) to
   respond to the reservation.  RSVP proxies would, thus, allow resource
   reservation over the segment which is the most likely bottleneck, the
   wireless connectivity.  If the wireless access network uses a local

Internet-Draft            RSVP Proxy Approaches               March 2010


   mobility management mechanism, where the IP address of the mobile
   node does not change during handover, RSVP reservations would follow
   the mobile node movement.

A.4.  RSVP Proxies for Reservations in the presence of IPsec Gateways

   [RFC4923] discusses how resource reservation can be supported end-to-
   end in a nested VPN environment.  At each VPN level, VPN Routers
   behave as [RFC4301] security gateways between a plaintext domain and
   a cyphertext domain.  To achieve end-to-end resource reservation, the
   VPN Routers process RSVP signaling on the plaintext side, perform
   aggregation of plaintext reservations, and maintain the corresponding
   aggregate RSVP reservations on the cyphertext side.  Each aggregate
   reservation is established on behalf of multiple encrypted end-to-end
   sessions sharing the same ingress and egress VPN Routers.  These
   aggregate reservations can be as specified in [RFC3175] or [RFC4860].

   Section 3 of [RFC4923] discusses the necessary data flows within a
   VPN Router to achieve the behavior described in the previous
   paragraph.  Two mechanisms are described to achieve such data flows.
   Section 3.1 presents the case where the VPN Router carries data
   across the cryptographic boundary.  Section 3.2 discusses the case
   where the VPN router uses a Network-Guard.

   Where such mechanisms are not supported by the VPN Routers, the
   approach for end-to-end reservation presented in [RFC4923] cannot be
   deployed.  An alternative approach to support resource reservations
   within the cyphertext core is to use the "Application_Entity-
   Controlled Proxy" approach (as defined in Section 4.5) in the
   following way:

   o  the RSVP Proxies are located inside the cyphertext domain and use
      aggregate RSVP reservations,

   o  the Application Entity exchange application level signaling with
      the end systems in the plaintext domain,

   o  the Application Entity controls the RSVP Proxies in the cyphertext
      domain via an RSVP Proxy control interface

   This is illustrated in Figure 17 in the case where the application is
   SIP-based multimedia communications.

                                 Gateways

   Where the sender and receiver are RSVP capable, they may also use
   RSVP signaling.  This achieves resource reservation on the plaintext
   segments of the end-to-end i.e. :

   o  from the sender to the ingress IPsec gateway and

   o  from the egress IPsec gateway to the receiver.

   In this use case, because the VPN Routers do not support any RSVP
   specific mechanism, the end-to-end RSVP signaling is effectively
   hidden by the IPsec gateways on the cyphertext segment of the end-to-
   end path.

   As with the "Application_Entity-Controlled Proxy" approach (defined
   in Section 4.5), the solution here for synchronizing RSVP signaling
   with application-level signaling is to rely on an application-level
   signaling device that controls an on-path RSVP Proxy function.
   However, in the present use case, the RSVP Proxies are a component of
   a cyphertext network where all user (bearer) traffic is IPsec
   encrypted.  This has a number of implications including the
   following:

   1.  encrypted flows can not be identified in the cyphertext domain so
       that network nodes can only classify traffic based on IP address
       and Differentiated Services codepoints (DSCPs).  As a result,
       only aggregate RSVP reservations (such as those specified in
       [RFC3175] or [RFC4860] ) can be used.  This is similar to
       [RFC4923].

   2.  Determining the RSVP Sender proxy and RSVP receiver Proxy to be
       used for aggregation of a given flow from sender to receiver
       creates a number of challenges.  Details on how this may be
       achieved are beyond the scope of this document.  We observe that,
       as illustrated in Figure 17, this may be facilitated by a network
       management interface between the application entity and the IPsec
       gateways.  For example, this interface may be used by the
       application entity to obtain information about which IPsec
       gateway is on the path of a given end-to-end flow.  Then, the
       application entity may maintain awareness of which RSVP Proxy is
       on the cyphertext path between a given pair of IPsec gateways.
       How such awareness is achieved is beyond the scope of this
       document.  We simply observe that such awareness can be easily
       achieved through simple configuration in the particular case
       where a single (physical or logical) RSVP Proxy is fronting a
       given IPsec gateway.  We also observe that when awareness of the
       RSVP Receiver Proxy for a particular egress IPsec gateway (or

       end-to-end flow) is not available, the aggregate reservation may
       be signaled by the RSVP Sender Proxy to the destination address
       of the egress IPsec gateway and then proxied by the RSVP Receiver
       Proxy.

   Different flavors of operations are possible in terms of aggregate
   reservation sizing.  For example, the application entity can initiate
   an aggregate reservation of fixed size a priori and then simply keep
   count of the bandwidth used by sessions and reject sessions that
   would result in excess usage of an aggregate reservation.  The
   application entity could also re-size the aggregate reservations on a
   session by session basis.  Alternatively, the application entity
   could re-size the aggregate reservations in step increments typically
   corresponding to the bandwidth requirement of multiple sessions.

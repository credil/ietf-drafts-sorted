    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides recommendations of best current practice for
      dropping or marking packets using any active queue management (AQM)
      algorithm, such as random early detection (RED), BLUE, pre-congestion
      notification (PCN), etc. We give three strong recommendations: (1)
      packet size should be taken into account when transports read and
      respond to congestion indications, (2) packet size should not be taken
      into account when network equipment creates congestion signals (marking,
      dropping), and therefore (3) in the specific case of RED, the byte-mode
      packet drop variant that drops fewer small packets should not be used.
      This memo updates RFC 2309 to deprecate deliberate preferential
      treatment of small packets in AQM algorithms.</t>

    <section anchor="pktb_Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>This memo concerns how we should correctly scale congestion control
      functions with respect to packet size for the long term. It also
      recognises that expediency may be necessary to deal with existing widely
      deployed protocols that don't live up to the long term goal.</t>

      <t>When signalling congestion, the problem of how (and whether) to take
      packet sizes into account has exercised the minds of researchers and
      practitioners for as long as active queue management (AQM) has been
      discussed. Indeed, one reason AQM was originally introduced was to
      reduce the lock-out effects that small packets can have on large packets
      in drop-tail queues. This memo aims to state the principles we should be
      using and to outline how these principles will affect future protocol
      design, taking into account the existing deployments we have
      already.</t>

      <t>The question of whether to take into account packet size arises at
      three stages in the congestion notification process: <list
          style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Measuring congestion:">When a congested resource
          measures locally how congested it is, should it measure its queue
          length in time, bytes or packets?</t>

          <t
          hangText="Encoding congestion notification into the wire protocol:">When
          a congested network resource signals its level of congestion, should
          it drop / mark each packet dependent on the size of the particular
          packet in question?</t>

          <t
          hangText="Decoding congestion notification from the wire protocol:">When
          a transport interprets the notification in order to decide how much
          to respond to congestion, should it take into account the size of
          each missing or marked packet?</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Consensus has emerged over the years concerning the first stage: if
      queues cannot be measured in time, whether they should be measured in
      bytes or packets. <xref target="pktb_Measure_Rec"/> of this memo records
      this consensus in the RFC Series. In summary the choice solely depends
      on whether the resource is congested by bytes or packets.</t>

      <t>The controversy is mainly around the last two stages: whether to
      allow for the size of the specific packet notifying congestion i) when
      the network encodes or ii) when the transport decodes the congestion
      notification.</t>

      <t>Currently, the RFC series is silent on this matter other than a paper
      trail of advice referenced from <xref target="RFC2309"/>, which
      conditionally recommends byte-mode (packet-size dependent) drop <xref
      target="pktByteEmail"/>. Reducing drop of small packets certainly has
      some tempting advantages: i) it drops less control packets, which tend
      to be small and ii) it makes TCP's bit-rate less dependent on packet
      size. However, there are ways of addressing these issues at the
      transport layer, rather than reverse engineering network forwarding to
      fix the problems.</t>

      <!--  of one specific transport, as byte-mode variant of RED was 
      designed to do.</t>
-->

      <!--
      <t>The primary purpose of this memo is to build a definitive consensus
      against deliberate preferential treatment for small packets in AQM
      algorithms and to record this advice within the RFC series. 
-->

      <t>This memo updates <xref target="RFC2309"/> to deprecate deliberate
      preferential treatment of small packets in AQM algorithms. It recommends
      that (1) packet size should be taken into account when transports read
      congestion indications, (2) not when network equipment writes them. This
      memo also adds to the congestion control principles enumerated in BCP 41
      <xref target="RFC2914"/>.</t>

      <t>In the particular case of Random early Detection (RED), this means
      that the byte-mode packet drop variant should not be used to drop fewer
      small packets, because that creates a perverse incentive for transports
      to use tiny segments, consequently also opening up a DoS vulnerability.
      Fortunately all the RED implementers who responded to our admittedly
      limited survey (<xref target="pktb_Coding_Status_Summary"/>) have not
      followed the earlier advice to use byte-mode drop, so the position this
      memo argues for seems to already exist in implementations.</t>

      <t>However, at the transport layer, TCP congestion control is a widely
      deployed protocol that doesn't scale with packet size. To date this
      hasn't been a significant problem because most TCP implementations have
      been used with similar packet sizes. But, as we design new congestion
      control mechanisms, this memo recommends that we should build in scaling
      with packet size rather than assuming we should follow TCP's
      example.</t>

      <t>This memo continues as follows. First it discusses terminology and
      scoping. <xref target="pktb_Recommendations"/> gives the concrete formal
      recommendations, followed by motivating arguments in <xref
      target="pktb_Motivation"/>. We then critically survey the advice given
      previously in the RFC series and the research literature (<xref
      target="pktb_Critique_Advice"/>), referring to an assessment of whether
      or not this advice has been followed in production networks (<xref
      target="pktb_SotA"/>). To wrap up, outstanding issues are discussed that
      will need resolution both to inform future protocol designs and to
      handle legacy (<xref target="pktb_Issues"/>). Then security issues are
      collected together in <xref target="pktb_Security_Considerations"/>
      before conclusions are drawn in <xref target="pktb_Conclusions"/>. The
      interested reader can find discussion of more detailed issues on the
      theme of byte vs. packet in the appendices.</t>

      <t>This memo intentionally includes a non-negligible amount of material
      on the subject. For the busy reader <xref
      target="pktb_Recommendations"/> summarises the recommendations for the
      Internet community.</t>

      <section anchor="pktb_term" title="Terminology and Scoping">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

        <t>This memo applies to the design of all AQM algorithms, for example,
        Random Early Detection (RED) <xref target="RFC2309"/>, BLUE <xref
        target="BLUE02"/>, Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) <xref
        target="RFC5670"/>, Controlled Delay (CoDel) <xref target="CoDel12"/>
        and the Proportional Integral controller Enhanced (PIE) <xref
        target="I-D.pan-tsvwg-pie"/>. Throughout, RED is used as a concrete
        example because it is a widely known and deployed AQM algorithm. There
        is no intention to imply that the advice is any less applicable to the
        other algorithms, nor that RED is preferred.</t>

             title="Working Definition of Congestion Notification">
-->

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Congestion Notification:">Congestion notification is
            a changing signal that aims to communicate the probability that
            the network resource(s) will not be able to forward the level of
            traffic load offered (or that there is an impending risk that they
            will not be able to).<vspace blankLines="1"/> The `impending risk'
            qualifier is added, because AQM systems set a virtual limit
            smaller than the actual limit to the resource, then notify when
            this virtual limit is exceeded in order to avoid uncontrolled
            congestion of the actual capacity.<vspace
            blankLines="1"/>Congestion notification communicates a real number
            bounded by the range [ 0 , 1 ]. This ties in with the most
            well-understood measure of congestion notification: drop
            probability.</t>

            <t hangText="Explicit and Implicit Notification:">The byte vs.
            packet dilemma concerns congestion notification irrespective of
            whether it is signalled implicitly by drop or using explicit
            congestion notification (ECN <xref target="RFC3168"/> or PCN <xref
            target="RFC5670"/>). Throughout this document, unless clear from
            the context, the term marking will be used to mean notifying
            congestion explicitly, while congestion notification will be used
            to mean notifying congestion either implicitly by drop or
            explicitly by marking.</t>

            <t hangText="Bit-congestible vs. Packet-congestible:">If the load
            on a resource depends on the rate at which packets arrive, it is
            called packet-congestible. If the load depends on the rate at
            which bits arrive it is called bit-congestible.<vspace
            blankLines="1"/>Examples of packet-congestible resources are route
            look-up engines and firewalls, because load depends on how many
            packet headers they have to process. Examples of bit-congestible
            resources are transmission links, radio power and most buffer
            memory, because the load depends on how many bits they have to
            transmit or store. Some machine architectures use fixed size
            packet buffers, so buffer memory in these cases is
            packet-congestible (see <xref
            target="pktb_Fixed_Buffers"/>).<vspace blankLines="1"/>The path
            through a machine will typically encounter both packet-congestible
            and bit-congestible resources. However, currently, a design goal
            of network processing equipment such as routers and firewalls is
            to size the packet-processing engine(s) relative to the lines in
            order to keep packet processing uncongested even under worst case
            packet rates with runs of minimum size packets. Therefore,
            packet-congestion is currently rare [<xref format="counter"
            target="RFC6077"/>; &sect;3.3], but there is no guarantee that it
            will not become more common in future. <vspace
            blankLines="1"/>Note that information is generally processed or
            transmitted with a minimum granularity greater than a bit (e.g.
            octets). The appropriate granularity for the resource in question
            should be used, but for the sake of brevity we will talk in terms
            of bytes in this memo.</t>

            <t hangText="Coarser Granularity:">Resources may be congestible at
            higher levels of granularity than bits or packets, for instance
            stateful firewalls are flow-congestible and call-servers are
            session-congestible. This memo focuses on congestion of
            connectionless resources, but the same principles may be
            applicable for congestion notification protocols controlling
            per-flow and per-session processing or state.</t>

            <t hangText="RED Terminology:">In RED whether to use packets or
            bytes when measuring queues is called respectively "packet-mode
            queue measurement" or "byte-mode queue measurement". And whether
            the probability of dropping a particular packet is independent or
            dependent on its size is called respectively "packet-mode drop" or
            "byte-mode drop". The terms byte-mode and packet-mode should not
            be used without specifying whether they apply to queue measurement
            or to drop.</t>

      <section anchor="pktb_Example"
               title="Example Comparing Packet-Mode Drop and Byte-Mode Drop">
        <t>Taking RED as a well-known example algorithm, a central question
        addressed by this document is whether to recommend RED's packet-mode
        drop variant and to deprecate byte-mode drop. <xref
        target="pktb_Tab_Example"/> compares how packet-mode and byte-mode
        drop affect two flows of different size packets. For each it gives the
        expected number of packets and of bits dropped in one second. Each
        example flow runs at the same bit-rate of 48Mb/s, but one is broken up
        into small 60 byte packets and the other into large 1500 byte
        packets.</t>

        <t>To keep up the same bit-rate, in one second there are about 25
        times more small packets because they are 25 times smaller. As can be
        seen from the table, the packet rate is 100,000 small packets versus
        4,000 large packets per second (pps).</t>

        <t>For packet-mode drop, we illustrate the effect of a drop
        probability of 0.1%, which the algorithm applies to all packets
        irrespective of size. Because there are 25 times more small packets in
        one second, it naturally drops 25 times more small packets, that is
        100 small packets but only 4 large packets. But if we count how many
        bits it drops, there are 48,000 bits in 100 small packets and 48,000
        bits in 4 large packets&mdash;the same number of bits of small packets
        as large.<list style="empty">
            <t>The packet-mode drop algorithm drops any bit with the same
            probability whether the bit is in a small or a large packet.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>For byte-mode drop, again we use an example drop probability of
        0.1%, but only for maximum size packets (assuming the link MTU is
        1,500B or 12,000b). The byte-mode algorithm reduces the drop
        probability of smaller packets proportional to their size, making the
        probability that it drops a small packet 25 times smaller at 0.004%.
        But there are 25 times more small packets, so dropping them with 25
        times lower probability results in dropping the same number of
        packets: 4 drops in both cases. The 4 small dropped packets contain 25
        times less bits than the 4 large dropped packets: 1,920 compared to
        48,000.<list style="empty">
            <t>The byte-mode drop algorithm drops any bit with a probability

        <t>Ideally, an AQM would measure the service time of the queue to
        measure congestion of a resource. However service time can only be
        measured as packets leave the queue, where it is not always feasible
        to implement a full AQM algorithm. To predict the service time as
        packets join the queue, an AQM algorithm needs to measure the length

        <t>In this case, if the resource is bit-congestible, the AQM

        the length of the queue in packets. No other choice makes sense,
        because the number of packets waiting in the queue isn't relevant if
        the resource gets congested by bytes and vice versa. For example, the
        length of the queue into a transmission line would be measured in
        bytes, while the length of the queue into a firewall would be measured
        in packets.</t>

        <t>To avoid the pathological effects of drop tail, the AQM can then
        transform this service time or queue length into the probability of
        dropping or marking a packet (e.g. RED's piecewise linear function
        between thresholds).</t>

        <t>When a transport detects that a packet has been lost or congestion

        as proportionate to the size in octets (bytes) of the missing or

        <t>In other words, when a packet indicates congestion (by being lost

        congestion indication on every octet of the packet, not just one
        indication per packet.</t>

        <t>To be clear, the above recommendation solely describes how a
        transport should interpret the meaning of a congestion indication. It
        makes no recommendation on whether a transport should act differently
        based on this interpretation. It merely aids interoperablity between
        transports, if they choose to make their actions depend on the

      <section anchor="pktb_Respond_Split"
               title="Recommendation on Handling Congestion Indications when Splitting or Merging Packets ">
        <t>Packets carrying congestion indications may be split or merged in
        some circumstances (e.g. at a RTP/RTCP transcoder or during IP
        fragment reassembly). Splitting and merging only make sense in the
        context of ECN, not loss.</t>

        <t>The general rule to follow is that the number of octets in packets
        with congestion indications SHOULD be equivalent before and after
        merging or splitting. This is based on the principle used above; that
        an indication of congestion on a packet can be considered as an
        indication of congestion on each octet of the packet.</t>

        <t>The above rule is not phrased with the word "MUST" to allow the
        following exception. There are cases where pre-existing protocols were
        not designed to conserve congestion marked octets (e.g. IP fragment
        reassembly <xref target="RFC3168"/> or loss statistics in RTCP
        receiver reports <xref target="RFC3550"/> before ECN was added <xref
        target="RFC6679"/>). When any such protocol is updated, it SHOULD
        comply with the above rule to conserve marked octets. However, the
        rule may be relaxed if it would otherwise become too complex to
        interoperate with pre-existing implementations of the protocol.</t>

        <t>One can think of a splitting or merging process as if all the
        incoming congestion-marked octets increment a counter and all the
        outgoing marked octets decrement the same counter. In order to ensure
        that congestion indications remain timely, even the smallest positive
        remainder in the conceptual counter should trigger the next outgoing
        packet to be marked (causing the counter to go negative).</t>

        <t>Imagine a scenario where the same bit rate of packets will
        contribute the same to bit-congestion of a link irrespective of
        whether it is sent as fewer larger packets or more smaller packets. A

            allowing more attack traffic to get through to cause further
            damage. Such a queue allows attack traffic to have a

        Consider a scenario where gentle RED <xref target="gentle_RED"/> is
        used, along with the variant of RED we advise against, i.e. where the
        RED algorithm is configured to adjust the drop probability of packets
        in proportion to each packet's size (byte mode packet drop). In this
        case, RED aims to drop 25x more of the larger packets than the smaller
        ones. Thus, for example if RED drops 25% of the larger packets, it
        will aim to drop 1% of the smaller packets (but in practice it may
        drop more as congestion increases [<xref format="counter"

        in the Introduction, as the large packet drop probability varies
        around 25% the small packet drop probability will vary around 1%, but
        with occasional jumps to 100% whenever the instantaneous queue (after
        drop) manages to sustain a length above the 100% drop point for longer

        for the smaller packets (because of rate variations it will actually
        be a little less than this target).</t>

        <t>Note that, although the byte-mode drop variant of RED amplifies

        <t>Dropping fewer control packets considerably improves performance.
        It is tempting to drop small packets with lower probability in order
        to improve performance, because many control packets tend to be
        smaller (TCP SYNs &amp; ACKs, DNS queries &amp; responses, SIP
        messages, HTTP GETs, etc). However, we must not give control packets
        preference purely by virtue of their smallness, otherwise it is too
        easy for any data source to get the same preferential treatment simply
        by sending data in smaller packets. Again we should not create
        perverse incentives to favour small packets rather than to favour
        control packets, which is what we intend.</t>

        <t>Just because many control packets are small does not mean all small
        packets are control packets.</t>

        <t>So, rather than fix these problems in the network, we argue that
        the transport should be made more robust against losses of control
        packets (see 'Making Transports Robust against Control Packet Losses'

        <!-- OLD
        <t>One motivation for the network biasing congestion notification by
        packet size is to counter this effect and try to equalise the
        bit-rates of flows with different packet sizes. 
-->

        <t>To counter this effect it seems tempting not to follow our
        recommendation, and instead for the network to bias congestion
        notification by packet size in order to equalise the bit-rates of
        flows with different packet sizes. However, in order to do this, the
        queuing algorithm has to make assumptions about the transport, which
        become embedded in the network. Specifically: <list style="symbols">
            <t>The queuing algorithm has to assume how aggressively the
            transport will respond to congestion (see <xref
            target="pktb_Coding_Status_Summary"/>). If the network assumes the
            transport responds as aggressively as TCP NewReno, it will be
            wrong for Compound TCP and differently wrong for Cubic TCP, etc.
            To achieve equal bit-rates, each transport then has to guess what
            assumption the network made, and work out how to replace this
            assumed aggressiveness with its own aggressiveness.</t>

            <!--

            <t>Also, if the network biases congestion notification by packet
            size it has to assume a baseline packet size&mdash;all proposed
            algorithms use the local MTU (for example see the byte-mode loss
            probability formula in Table 1). Then if the non-Reno transports
            mentioned above are trying to reverse engineer what the network
            assumed, they also have to guess the MTU of the congested
            link.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Even though reducing the drop probability of small packets (e.g.
        RED's byte-mode drop) helps ensure TCP flows with different packet
        sizes will achieve similar bit rates, we argue this correction should
        be made to any future transport protocols based on TCP, not to the
        network in order to fix one transport, no matter how predominant it
        is. Effectively, favouring small packets is reverse engineering of
        network equipment around one particular transport protocol (TCP),
        contrary to the excellent advice in <xref target="RFC3426"/>, which
        asks designers to question "Why are you proposing a solution at this
        layer of the protocol stack, rather than at another layer?"</t>

        <t>In contrast, if the network never takes account of packet size, the
        transport can be certain it will never need to guess any assumptions
        the network has made. And the network passes two pieces of information
        to the transport that are sufficient in all cases: i) congestion
        notification on the packet and ii) the size of the packet. Both are
        available for the transport to combine (by taking account of packet
        size when responding to congestion) or not. <xref
        target="pktb_Ideal"/> checks that these two pieces of information are
        sufficient for all relevant scenarios.</t>

        <t>When the network does not take account of packet size, it allows
        transport protocols to choose whether to take account of packet size
        or not. However, if the network were to bias congestion notification
        by packet size, transport protocols would have no choice; those that
        did not take account of packet size themselves would unwittingly
        become dependent on packet size, and those that already took account
        of packet size would end up taking account of it twice.</t>

            <t>Transports on the other hand don't always want to make their

        following argument is stronger; in addition it says "Don't give the
        network task X that could be done by the end-systems, if X is not
        deployed on all network nodes, and end-systems won't be able to tell
        whether their network is doing X, or whether they need to do X
        themselves." In this case, the X in question is "making the response
        to congestion depend on packet size".</t>

        <t>We will now re-run this argument taking each step in more depth.
        The argument applies solely to drop, not to ECN marking.</t>

        <t>A queue drops packets for either of two reasons: a) to signal to
        host congestion controls that they should reduce the load and b)
        because there is no buffer left to store the packets. Active queue
        management tries to use drops as a signal for hosts to slow down (case
        a) so that drop due to buffer exhaustion (case b) should not be
        necessary.</t>

        <t>AQM is not universally deployed in every queue in the Internet;
        many cheap Ethernet bridges, software firewalls, NATs on consumer
        devices, etc implement simple tail-drop buffers. Even if AQM were
        universal, it has to be able to cope with buffer exhaustion (by
        switching to a behaviour like tail-drop), in order to cope with
        unresponsive or excessive transports. For these reasons networks will
        sometimes be dropping packets as a last resort (case b) rather than
        under AQM control (case a).</t>

        <t>When buffers are exhausted (case b), they don't naturally drop
        packets in proportion to their size. The network can only reduce the
        probability of dropping smaller packets if it has enough space to
        store them somewhere while it waits for a larger packet that it can
        drop. If the buffer is exhausted, it does not have this choice.
        Admittedly tail-drop does naturally drop somewhat fewer small packets,
        but exactly how few depends more on the mix of sizes than the size of
        the packet in question. Nonetheless, in general, if we wanted networks
        to do size-dependent drop, we would need universal deployment of
        (packet-size dependent) AQM code, which is currently unrealistic.</t>

        <t>A host transport cannot know whether any particular drop was a
        deliberate signal from an AQM or a sign of a queue shedding packets
        due to buffer exhaustion. Therefore, because the network cannot
        universally do size-dependent drop, it should not do it all.</t>

        <t>Whereas universality is desirable in the network, diversity is
        desirable between different transport layer protocols - some, like
        NewReno TCP <xref target="RFC5681"/>, may not choose to make their
        rate response proportionate to the size of each dropped packet, while
        others will (e.g. TFRC-SP <xref target="RFC4828"/>).</t>

        <!--
        <t>Having so far justified only our recommendations for the network,
        this section focuses on the host. We construct a scaling argument to
        justify the recommendation that a host should respond to a dropped or
        marked packet in proportion to its size, not just as a single
        congestion event.</t>

        <t>The argument assumes that we have already sufficiently justified
        our recommendation that the network should not take account of packet
        size. </t>

        <t>Also, we assume bit-congestible links are the predominant source of
        congestion. As the Internet stands, it is hard if not impossible to
        know whether congestion notification is from a bit-congestible or a
        packet-congestible resource (see <xref
        target="pktb_bit_pkt-congestible"></xref>) so we have to assume the
        most prevalent case (see <xref target="pktb_term"></xref>). If this
        assumption is wrong, and particular congestion indications are
        actually due to overload of packet-processing, there is no issue of
        safety at stake. Any congestion control that triggers a multiplicative
        decrease in response to a congestion indication will bring packet
        processing back to its operating point just as quickly. The only issue
        at stake is that the resource could be utilised more efficiently if
        packet-congestion could be separately identified.</t>

        <t>

        <!-- Here we try to design a test to see which
        approach scales with packet size.</t>

-->

        <!-- Imagine a bit-congestible link shared by many flows, so that each busy
        period tends to cause packets to be lost from different flows.
        Consider further two sources that have the same data rate but break
        the load into large packets in one application (A) and small packets
        in the other (B). Of course, because the load is the same, there will
        be proportionately more packets in the small packet flow (B).</t>

        <t>If a congestion control scales with packet size it should respond
        in the same way to the same congestion notification, irrespective of
        the size of the packets containing the bytes that contribute to 
	congestion.</t>

        <t>A bit-congestible queue suffering congestion has to drop or mark
        the same excess bytes whether they are in a few large packets (A) or
        many small packets (B). So for the same amount of congestion overload,
        the same amount of bytes has to be shed to get the load back to its
        operating point. For smaller packets (B) more packets
        will have to be discarded to shed the same bytes.</t>

        <t>If both the transports interpret each drop/mark as a single loss
        event irrespective of the size of the packet dropped, the flow of
        smaller packets (B) will respond more times to the same congestion. On
        the other hand, if a transport responds proportionately less when
        smaller packets are dropped/marked, overall it will be able to respond
        the same to the same amount of congestion.</t>

        <t>Therefore, for a congestion control to scale with packet size it
        should respond to dropped or marked bytes (as TFRC-SP <xref
        target="RFC4828"></xref> effectively does), instead of dropped or
        marked packets (as TCP does).</t>

        <t>For the avoidance of doubt, this is not a recommendation that TCP
        should be changed so that it scales with packet size. It is a
        recommendation that any future transport protocol proposal should
        respond to dropped or marked bytes if it wishes to claim that it is
        scalable.</t>

      <section anchor="pktb_Impl_Efficiency" title="Implementation Efficiency">
        <t>Biasing against large packets typically requires an extra multiply
        and divide in the network (see the example byte-mode drop formula in
        Table 1). Allowing for packet size at the transport rather than in the
        network ensures that neither the network nor the transport needs to do
        a multiply operation&mdash;multiplication by packet size is
        effectively achieved as a repeated add when the transport adds to its
        count of marked bytes as each congestion event is fed to it. Also the
        work to do the biasing is spread over many hosts, rather than
        concentrated in just the congested network element. These aren't
        principled reasons in themselves, but they are a happy consequence of
        the other principled reasons.</t>

             title="A Survey and Critique of Past Advice">
      <t>This section is informative, not normative.</t>

      <t>The original 1993 paper on RED <xref target="RED93"/> proposed two
      options for the RED active queue management algorithm: packet mode and
      byte mode. Packet mode measured the queue length in packets and dropped
      (or marked) individual packets with a probability independent of their
      size. Byte mode measured the queue length in bytes and marked an
      individual packet with probability in proportion to its size (relative
      to the maximum packet size). In the paper's outline of further work, it
      was stated that no recommendation had been made on whether the queue
      size should be measured in bytes or packets, but noted that the
      difference could be significant.</t>

      <t>When RED was recommended for general deployment in 1998 <xref
      target="RFC2309"/>, the two modes were mentioned implying the choice
      between them was a question of performance, referring to a 1997 email
      <xref target="pktByteEmail"/> for advice on tuning. A later addendum to
      this email introduced the insight that there are in fact two orthogonal
      choices: <list style="symbols">
          <t>whether to measure queue length in bytes or packets (<xref
          target="pktb_Measure_Status"/>)</t>

          <t>whether the drop probability of an individual packet should
          depend on its own size (<xref target="pktb_Coding_Status"/>).</t>
        </list>The rest of this section is structured accordingly.</t>

               title="Congestion Measurement Advice">
        <t>The choice of which metric to use to measure queue length was left
        open in RFC2309. It is now well understood that queues for
        bit-congestible resources should be measured in bytes, and queues for
        packet-congestible resources should be measured in packets <xref
        target="pktByteEmail"/>.</t>

        <t>Some modern queue implementations give a choice for setting RED's
        thresholds in byte-mode or packet-mode. This may merely be an
        administrator-interface preference, not altering how the queue itself
        is measured but on some hardware it does actually change the way it
        measures its queue. Whether a resource is bit-congestible or
        packet-congestible is a property of the resource, so an admin should
        not ever need to, or be able to, configure the way a queue measures
        itself.</t>
-->

        <t>Congestion in some legacy bit-congestible buffers is only measured
        in packets not bytes. In such cases, the operator has to set the
        thresholds mindful of a typical mix of packets sizes. Any AQM
        algorithm on such a buffer will be oversensitive to high proportions
        of small packets, e.g. a DoS attack, and under-sensitive to high
        proportions of large packets. However, there is no need to make
        allowances for the possibility of such legacy in future protocol
        design. This is safe because any under-sensitivity during unusual
        traffic mixes cannot lead to congestion collapse given the buffer will
        eventually revert to tail drop, discarding proportionately more large
        packets.</t>

        <section anchor="pktb_Fixed_Buffers" title="Fixed Size Packet Buffers">
          <t>The question of whether to measure queues in bytes or packets
          seems to be well understood. However, measuring congestion is
          confusing when the resource is bit congestible but the queue into
          the resource is packet congestible. This section outlines the
          approach to take.</t>

          <t>Some, mostly older, queuing hardware allocates fixed sized
          buffers in which to store each packet in the queue. This hardware
          forwards to the line in one of two ways:<list style="symbols">
              <t>With some hardware, any fixed sized buffers not completely
              filled by a packet are padded when transmitted to the wire. This
              case, should clearly be treated as packet-congestible, because
              both queuing and transmission are in fixed MTU-sized units.
              Therefore the queue length in packets is a good model of
              congestion of the link.</t>

              <t>More commonly, hardware with fixed size packet buffers
              transmits packets to line without padding. This implies a hybrid
              forwarding system with transmission congestion dependent on the
              size of packets but queue congestion dependent on the number of
              packets, irrespective of their size. <vspace
              blankLines="1"/>Nonetheless, there would be no queue at all
              unless the line had become congested&mdash;the root-cause of any
              congestion is too many bytes arriving for the line. Therefore,
              the AQM should measure the queue length as the sum of all the
              packet sizes in bytes that are queued up waiting to be serviced
              by the line, irrespective of whether each packet is held in a
              fixed size buffer.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>In the (unlikely) first case where use of padding means the queue
          should be measured in packets, further confusion is likely because
          the fixed buffers are rarely all one size. Typically pools of
          different sized buffers are provided (Cisco uses the term 'buffer
          carving' for the process of dividing up memory into these pools
          <xref target="IOSArch"/>). Usually, if the pool of small buffers is
          exhausted, arriving small packets can borrow space in the pool of
          large buffers, but not vice versa. However, there is no need to
          consider all this complexity, because the root-cause of any
          congestion is still line overload&mdash;buffer consumption is only
          the symptom. Therefore, the length of the queue should be measured
          as the sum of the bytes in the queue that will be transmitted to
          line, including any padding. In the (unusual) case of transmission
          with padding this means the sum of the sizes of the small buffers
          queued plus the sum of the sizes of the large buffers queued.</t>

          <t>We will return to borrowing of fixed sized buffers when we
          discuss biasing the drop/marking probability of a specific packet
          because of its size in <xref target="pktb_Network_Bias"/>. But here
          we can repeat the simple rule for how to measure the length of
          queues of fixed buffers: no matter how complicated the buffering
          scheme is, ultimately a transmission line is nearly always
          bit-congestible so the number of bytes queued up waiting for the
          line measures how congested the line is, and it is rarely important
          to measure how congested the buffering system is.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="pktb_Measurement_NoQ"
                 title="Congestion Measurement without a Queue">
          <t>AQM algorithms are nearly always described assuming there is a
          queue for a congested resource and the algorithm can use the queue
          length to determine the probability that it will drop or mark each
          packet. But not all congested resources lead to queues. For
          instance, wireless spectrum is usually regarded as bit-congestible
          (for a given coding scheme). <!--, because interference increases with the rate at which bits
          are transmitted. -->But wireless link protocols do not always
          maintain a queue that depends on spectrum interference. Similarly,
          power limited resources are also usually bit-congestible if energy
          is primarily required for transmission rather than header
          processing, but it is rare for a link protocol to build a queue as
          it approaches maximum power.</t>

          <t>Nonetheless, AQM algorithms do not require a queue in order to
          work. For instance spectrum congestion can be modelled by signal
          quality using target bit-energy-to-noise-density ratio. And, to
          model radio power exhaustion, transmission power levels can be
          measured and compared to the maximum power available. <xref
          target="ECNFixedWireless"/> proposes a practical and theoretically
          sound way to combine congestion notification for different
          bit-congestible resources at different layers along an end to end
          path, whether wireless or wired, and whether with or without
          queues.</t>

          <section anchor="" title="Advice on Packet Size Bias in RED">
            <t>The previously mentioned email <xref target="pktByteEmail"/>
            referred to by <xref target="RFC2309"/> advised that most scarce
            resources in the Internet were bit-congestible, which is still
            believed to be true (<xref target="pktb_term"/>). But it went on
            to offer advice that is updated by this memo. It said that drop
            probability should depend on the size of the packet being
            considered for drop if the resource is bit-congestible, but not if
            it is packet-congestible. The argument continued that if packet
            drops were inflated by packet size (byte-mode dropping), "a flow's
            fraction of the packet drops is then a good indication of that
            flow's fraction of the link bandwidth in bits per second". This
            was consistent with a referenced policing mechanism being worked
            on at the time for detecting unusually high bandwidth flows,
            eventually published in 1999 <xref target="pBox"/>. However, the
            problem could and should have been solved by making the policing
            mechanism count the volume of bytes randomly dropped, not the
            number of packets.</t>

            <t>A few months before RFC2309 was published, an addendum was
            added to the above archived email referenced from the RFC, in
            which the final paragraph seemed to partially retract what had
            previously been said. It clarified that the question of whether
            the probability of dropping/marking a packet should depend on its
            size was not related to whether the resource itself was bit
            congestible, but a completely orthogonal question. However the
            only example given had the queue measured in packets but packet
            drop depended on the size of the packet in question. No example
            was given the other way round.</t>

            <t>In 2000, Cnodder et al <xref target="REDbyte"/> pointed out
            that there was an error in the part of the original 1993 RED
            algorithm that aimed to distribute drops uniformly, because it
            didn't correctly take into account the adjustment for packet size.
            They recommended an algorithm called RED_4 to fix this. But they
            also recommended a further change, RED_5, to adjust drop rate
            dependent on the square of relative packet size. This was indeed
            consistent with one implied motivation behind RED's byte mode
            drop&mdash;that we should reverse engineer the network to improve
            the performance of dominant end-to-end congestion control
            mechanisms. This memo makes a different recommendations in <xref
            target="pktb_Recommendations"/>.</t>

            <t>By 2003, a further change had been made to the adjustment for
            packet size, this time in the RED algorithm of the ns2 simulator.
            Instead of taking each packet's size relative to a `maximum packet
            size' it was taken relative to a `mean packet size', intended to
            be a static value representative of the `typical' packet size on
            the link. We have not been able to find a justification in the
            literature for this change, however Eddy and Allman conducted
            experiments <xref target="REDbias"/> that assessed how sensitive
            RED was to this parameter, amongst other things. However, this
            changed algorithm can often lead to drop probabilities of greater
            than 1 (which gives a hint that there is probably a mistake in the
            theory somewhere).</t>

            <t>On 10-Nov-2004, this variant of byte-mode packet drop was made
            the default in the ns2 simulator. It seems unlikely that byte-mode
            drop has ever been implemented in production networks (<xref
            target="pktb_SotA"/>), therefore any conclusions based on ns2
            simulations that use RED without disabling byte-mode drop are
            likely to behave very differently from RED in production
            networks.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Packet Size Bias Regardless of AQM">
            <t>The byte-mode drop variant of RED (or a similar variant of
            other AQM algorithms) is not the only possible bias towards small
            packets in queueing systems. We have already mentioned that
            tail-drop queues naturally tend to lock-out large packets once
            they are full.</t>

            <t>But also queues with fixed sized buffers reduce the probability
            that small packets will be dropped if (and only if) they allow
            small packets to borrow buffers from the pools for larger packets
            (see <xref target="pktb_Fixed_Buffers"/>). Borrowing effectively
            makes the maximum queue size for small packets greater than that
            for large packets, because more buffers can be used by small
            packets while less will fit large packets. Incidentally, the bias
            towards small packets from buffer borrowing is nothing like as
            large as that of RED's byte-mode drop.</t>

            <t>Nonetheless, fixed-buffer memory with tail drop is still prone
            to lock-out large packets, purely because of the tail-drop aspect.
            So, fixed size packet-buffers should be augmented with a good AQM
            algorithm and packet-mode drop. If an AQM is too complicated to
            implement with multiple fixed buffer pools, the minimum necessary
            to prevent large packet lock-out is to ensure smaller packets
            never use the last available buffer in any of the pools for larger
            packets.</t>

          process. Whereas, within the IETF, there are many different
          proposals to alter transport protocols to achieve the same goals,

          that inflates the flow rate by the ratio of a typical TCP segment
          size (1500B including TCP header) over the actual segment size <xref
          target="PktSizeEquCC"/>. (There are also other important differences
          of detail relative to TFRC, such as using virtual packets <xref
          target="CCvarPktSize"/> to avoid responding to multiple losses per
          round trip and using a minimum inter-packet interval.)</t>

          <t>Section 4.5.1 of this TFRC-SP spec discusses the implications of
          operating in an environment where queues have been configured to
          drop smaller packets with proportionately lower probability than
          larger ones. But it only discusses TCP operating in such an
          environment, only mentioning TFRC-SP briefly when discussing how to
          define fairness with TCP. And it only discusses the byte-mode
          dropping version of RED as it was before Cnodder et al pointed out
          it didn't sufficiently bias towards small packets to make TCP
          independent of packet size.</t>

          <t>So the TFRC-SP spec doesn't address the issue of which of the
          network or the transport <spanx style="emph">should</spanx> handle
          fairness between different packet sizes. In its Appendix B.4 it
          discusses the possibility of both TFRC-SP and some network buffers
          duplicating each other's attempts to deliberately bias towards small
          packets. But the discussion is not conclusive, instead reporting
          simulations of many of the possibilities in order to assess
          performance but not recommending any particular course of
          action.</t>

          <t>The paper originally proposing TFRC with virtual packets
          (VP-TFRC) <xref target="CCvarPktSize"/> proposed that there should
          perhaps be two variants to cater for the different variants of RED.
          However, as the TFRC-SP authors point out, there is no way for a
          transport to know whether some queues on its path have deployed RED
          with byte-mode packet drop (except if an exhaustive survey found
          that no-one has deployed it!&mdash;see <xref target="pktb_SotA"/>).
          Incidentally, VP-TFRC also proposed that byte-mode RED dropping
          should really square the packet-size compensation-factor (like that
          of Cnodder's RED_5, but apparently unaware of it).</t>

          <t>Pre-congestion notification <xref target="RFC5670"/> is an IETF
          technology to use a virtual queue for AQM marking for packets within
          one Diffserv class in order to give early warning prior to any real
          queuing. The PCN marking algorithms have been designed not to take
          account of packet size when forwarding through queues. Instead the
          general principle has been to take account of the sizes of marked
          packets when monitoring the fraction of marking at the edge of the
          network, as recommended here.</t>

        <section anchor="pktb_Transport_Robust_Ctrl_Loss"
                 title="Making Transports Robust against Control Packet Losses">
          <t>Recently, two RFCs have defined changes to TCP that make it more
          robust against losing small control packets <xref target="RFC5562"/>
          <xref target="RFC5690"/>. In both cases they note that the case for
          these two TCP changes would be weaker if RED were biased against
          dropping small packets. We argue here that these two proposals are a
          safer and more principled way to achieve TCP performance
          improvements than reverse engineering RED to benefit TCP.</t>

          <t>Although there are no known proposals, it would also be possible
          and perfectly valid to make control packets robust against drop by
          explicitly requesting a lower drop probability using their Diffserv
          code point <xref target="RFC2474"/> to request a scheduling class
          with lower drop.</t>

          <!--{ToDo: If ConEx defines optional preferential drop, 
add its protocol definition to the Diffserv ref above}-->

          <t>Although not brought to the IETF, a simple proposal from Wischik
          <xref target="DupTCP"/> suggests that the first three packets of
          every TCP flow should be routinely duplicated after a short delay.
          It shows that this would greatly improve the chances of short flows
          completing quickly, but it would hardly increase traffic levels on
          the Internet, because Internet bytes have always been concentrated
          in the large flows. It further shows that the performance of many
          typical applications depends on completion of long serial chains of
          short messages. It argues that, given most of the value people get
          from the Internet is concentrated within short flows, this simple
          expedient would greatly increase the value of the best efforts
          Internet at minimal cost.</t>

          <t><xref target="pktb_Tab_TFRC-SP"/> aims to summarise the potential
          effects of all the advice from different sources. Each column shows
          a different possible AQM behaviour in different queues in the
          network, using the terminology of Cnodder et al outlined earlier
          (RED_1 is basic RED with packet-mode drop). Each row shows a
          different transport behaviour: TCP <xref target="RFC5681"/> and TFRC
          <xref target="RFC5348"/> on the top row with TFRC-SP <xref
          target="RFC4828"/> below. Each cell shows how the bits per round
          trip of a flow depends on packet size, s, and drop probability, p.
          In order to declutter the formulae to focus on packet-size
          dependence they are all given per round trip, which removes any RTT
          term.</t>

          <t>Let us assume that the goal is for the bit-rate of a flow to be
          independent of packet size. Suppressing all inessential details, the
          table shows that this should either be achievable by not altering
          the TCP transport in a RED_5 network, or using the small packet
          TFRC-SP transport (or similar) in a network without any byte-mode
          dropping RED (top right and bottom left). Top left is the `do
          nothing' scenario, while bottom right is the `do-both' scenario in
          which bit-rate would become far too biased towards small packets. Of
          course, if any form of byte-mode dropping RED has been deployed on a
          subset of queues that congest, each path through the network will
          present a different hybrid scenario to its transport.</t>

          <t>Whatever, we can see that the linear byte-mode drop column in the
          middle would considerably complicate the Internet. It's a half-way
          house that doesn't bias enough towards small packets even if one
          believes the network should be doing the biasing. <xref
          target="pktb_Recommendations"/> recommends that <spanx style="emph">all</spanx>
          bias in network equipment towards small packets should be turned
          off&mdash;if indeed any equipment vendors have implemented
          it&mdash;leaving packet-size bias solely as the preserve of the
          transport layer (solely the leftmost, packet-mode drop column).</t>

          <t>In practice it seems that no deliberate bias towards small
          packets has been implemented for production networks. Of the 19% of
          vendors who responded to a survey of 84 equipment vendors, none had
          implemented byte-mode drop in RED (see <xref target="pktb_SotA"/>
          for details).</t>

      <section anchor="pktb_Bit-World" title="Bit-congestible Network">
        <t>For a connectionless network with nearly all resources being
        bit-congestible the recommended position is clear&mdash;that the
        network should not make allowance for packet sizes and the transport
        should. This leaves two outstanding issues: <list style="symbols">
            <t>How to handle any legacy of AQM with byte-mode drop already
            deployed;</t>

            <t>The need to start a programme to update transport congestion
            control protocol standards to take account of packet size.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>A survey of equipment vendors (<xref
        target="pktb_Coding_Status_Summary"/>) found no evidence that
        byte-mode packet drop had been implemented, so deployment will be
        sparse at best. A migration strategy is not really needed to remove an
        algorithm that may not even be deployed.</t>

        <t>A programme of experimental updates to take account of packet size
        in transport congestion control protocols has already started with
        TFRC-SP <xref target="RFC4828"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <!-- ________________________________________________________________ -->

      <section anchor="pktb_Bit-Pkt-World"
               title="Bit- &amp; Packet-congestible Network">
        <t>The position is much less clear-cut if the Internet becomes
        populated by a more even mix of both packet-congestible and
        bit-congestible resources (see <xref
        target="pktb_bit_pkt-congestible"/>). This problem is not pressing,
        because most Internet resources are designed to be bit-congestible
        before packet processing starts to congest (see <xref
        target="pktb_term"/>).</t>

        <t>The IRTF Internet congestion control research group (ICCRG) has set
        itself the task of reaching consensus on generic forwarding mechanisms
        that are necessary and sufficient to support the Internet's future
        congestion control requirements (the first challenge in <xref
        target="RFC6077"/>). The research question of whether packet
        congestion might become common and what to do if it does may in the
        future be explored in the IRTF (the "Challenge 3: Packet Size" in
        <xref target="RFC6077"/>).</t>

    <section anchor="pktb_Security_Considerations"
             title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This memo recommends that queues do not bias drop probability towards
      small packets as this creates a perverse incentive for transports to
      break down their flows into tiny segments. One of the benefits of
      implementing AQM was meant to be to remove this perverse incentive that
      drop-tail queues gave to small packets.</t>

      <!-- Of course, if
      transports really want to make the greatest gains, they don't have to
      respond to congestion anyway. But we don't want applications that are
      trying to behave to discover that they can go faster by using smaller
      packets.</t>
-->

      <t>In practice, transports cannot all be trusted to respond to
      congestion. So another reason for recommending that queues do not bias
      drop probability towards small packets is to avoid the vulnerability to
      small packet DDoS attacks that would otherwise result. One of the
      benefits of implementing AQM was meant to be to remove drop-tail's DoS
      vulnerability to small packets, so we shouldn't add it back again.</t>

      <t>If most queues implemented AQM with byte-mode drop, the resulting
      network would amplify the potency of a small packet DDoS attack. At the
      first queue the stream of packets would push aside a greater proportion
      of large packets, so more of the small packets would survive to attack
      the next queue. Thus a flood of small packets would continue on towards
      the destination, pushing regular traffic with large packets out of the
      way in one queue after the next, but suffering much less drop
      itself.</t>

      <t><xref target="pktb_Policing_Congestion_Response"/> explains why the
      ability of networks to police the response of <spanx style="emph">any</spanx>
      transport to congestion depends on bit-congestible network resources
      only doing packet-mode not byte-mode drop. In summary, it says that
      making drop probability depend on the size of the packets that bits
      happen to be divided into simply encourages the bits to be divided into
      smaller packets. Byte-mode drop would therefore irreversibly complicate
      any attempt to fix the Internet's incentive structures.</t>

    <section anchor="pktb_Conclusions" title="Conclusions">
      <t>This memo identifies the three distinct stages of the congestion
      notification process where implementations need to decide whether to
      take packet size into account. The recommendations provided in Section 2
      of this memo are different in each case:<list style="symbols">
          <t>When network equipment measures the length of a queue, whether it
          counts in bytes or packets depends on whether the network resource
          is congested respectively by bytes or by packets.</t>

          <t>When network equipment decides whether to drop (or mark) a
          packet, it is recommended that the size of the particular packet
          should not be taken into account</t>

          <t>However, when a transport algorithm responds to a dropped or
          marked packet, the size of the rate reduction should be
          proportionate to the size of the packet.</t>
        </list>In summary, the answers are 'it depends', 'no' and 'yes'
      respectively</t>

      <t>For the specific case of RED, this means that byte-mode queue
      measurement will often be appropriate although byte-mode drop is
      strongly deprecated.</t>

      <t>At the transport layer the IETF should continue updating congestion
      control protocols to take account of the size of each packet that
      indicates congestion. Also the IETF should continue to make protocols
      less sensitive to losing control packets like SYNs, pure ACKs and DNS
      exchanges. Although many control packets happen to be small, the
      alternative of network equipment favouring all small packets would be
      dangerous. That would create perverse incentives to split data transfers
      into smaller packets.</t>

      <t>The memo develops these recommendations from principled arguments
      concerning scaling, layering, incentives, inherent efficiency, security
      and policeability. But it also addresses practical issues such as
      specific buffer architectures and incremental deployment. Indeed a
      limited survey of RED implementations is discussed, which shows there
      appears to be little, if any, installed base of RED's byte-mode drop.
      Therefore it can be deprecated with little, if any, incremental
      deployment complications.</t>

      <t>The recommendations have been developed on the well-founded basis
      that most Internet resources are bit-congestible not packet-congestible.
      We need to know the likelihood that this assumption will prevail longer
      term and, if it might not, what protocol changes will be needed to cater
      for a mix of the two. The IRTF Internet Congestion Control Research
      Group (ICCRG) is currently working on these problems <xref
      target="RFC6077"/>.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are facing problems where
            localized congestion prevents full utilization of the path between
            sender and receiver at today's "broadband" speeds. ISPs desire to
            control this congestion, which often appears to be caused by a
            small number of users consuming a large amount of bandwidth.
            Building out more capacity along all of the path to handle this
            congestion can be expensive and may not result in improvements for
            all users so network operators have sought other ways to manage
            congestion. The current mechanisms all suffer from difficulty
            measuring the congestion (as distinguished from the total
            traffic). The ConEx Working Group is designing a mechanism to make
            congestion along any path visible at the Internet Layer. This
            document describes example cases where this mechanism would be
            useful.</t>

             title="Congestion Notification Definition: Further Justification">
      <t>In <xref target="pktb_term"></xref> on the definition of congestion
      notification, load not capacity was used as the denominator. This also
      has a subtle significance in the related debate over the design of new
      transport protocols&mdash;typical new protocol designs (e.g. in XCP
      <xref target="xcp-spec"></xref> &amp; Quickstart <xref
      target="RFC4782"></xref>) expect the sending transport to communicate
      its desired flow rate to the network and network elements to
      progressively subtract from this so that the achievable flow rate
      emerges at the receiving transport.</t>

      <t>Congestion notification with total load in the denominator can serve
      a similar purpose (though in retrospect not in advance like XCP &amp;
      QuickStart). Congestion notification is a dimensionless fraction but
      each source can extract necessary rate information from it because it
      already knows what its own rate is. Even though congestion notification
      doesn't communicate a rate explicitly, from each source's point of view
      congestion notification represents the fraction of the rate it was
      sending a round trip ago that couldn't (or wouldn't) be served by
      available resources.</t>

    <section anchor="pktb_SotA" title="Survey of RED Implementation Status">
      <t>This Appendix is informative, not normative.</t>

      <t>In May 2007 a survey was conducted of 84 vendors to assess how widely
      drop probability based on packet size has been implemented in RED <xref
      target="pktb_Tab_RED_Survey"/>. <!--          Prior to the survey, an individual approach to Cisco received
          confirmation that, having checked the code-base for each of the
          product ranges, Cisco has not implemented any discrimination based
          on packet size in any AQM algorithm in any of its products. Also an
          individual approach to Alcatel-Lucent drew a confirmation that it
          was very likely that none of their products contained RED code that
          implemented any packet-size bias.</t>

          <t>Turning to the survey (<xref
          target="pktb_Tab_RED_Survey"></xref>), 
-->About 19% of those surveyed replied, giving a sample size of 16. Although
      in most cases we do not have permission to identify the respondents, we
      can say that those that have responded include most of the larger
      equipment vendors, covering a large fraction of the market. The two who
      gave permission to be identified were Cisco and Alcatel-Lucent. The
      others range across the large network equipment vendors at L3 &amp; L2,
      firewall vendors, wireless equipment vendors, as well as large software
      businesses with a small selection of networking products. All those who
      responded confirmed that they have not implemented the variant of RED
      with drop dependent on packet size (2 were fairly sure they had not but
      needed to check more thoroughly). At the time the survey was conducted,
      Linux did not implement RED with packet-size bias of drop, although we
      have not investigated a wider range of open source code.</t>

      <t>Where reasons have been given, the extra complexity of packet bias
      code has been most prevalent, though one vendor had a more principled
      reason for avoiding it&mdash;similar to the argument of this
      document.</t>

      <!--
          <t>Finally, we repeat that RED's byte mode drop SHOULD be disabled,
          but active queue management such as RED SHOULD be enabled wherever
          possible if we are to eradicate bias towards small
          packets&mdash;without any AQM at all, tail-drop tends to lock-out
          large packets very effectively. </t>
-->

      <t>Our survey was of vendor implementations, so we cannot be certain
      about operator deployment. But we believe many queues in the Internet
      are still tail-drop. The company of one of the co-authors (BT) has
      widely deployed RED, but many tail-drop queues are bound to still exist,
      particularly in access network equipment and on middleboxes like
      firewalls, where RED is not always available.</t>

      <t>Routers using a memory architecture based on fixed size buffers with
      borrowing may also still be prevalent in the Internet. As explained in
      <xref target="pktb_Network_Bias"/>, these also provide a marginal (but
      legitimate) bias towards small packets. So even though RED byte-mode
      drop is not prevalent, it is likely there is still some bias towards
      small packets in the Internet due to tail drop and fixed buffer
      borrowing.</t>

      <t>This Appendix is informative, not normative.</t>

      <t>Here we check that packet-mode drop (or marking) in the network gives
      sufficiently generic information for the transport layer to use. We
      check against a 2x2 matrix of four scenarios that may occur now or in
      the future (<xref target="pktb_Tab_Main_Scenarios"/>). The horizontal
      and vertical dimensions have been chosen because each tests extremes of
      sensitivity to packet size in the transport and in the network
      respectively.</t>

      <t>Note that this section does not consider byte-mode drop at all.
      Having deprecated byte-mode drop, the goal here is to check that
      packet-mode drop will be sufficient in all cases.</t>

        <t>In all cases we consider a packet-mode drop queue that indicates
        congestion by dropping (or marking) packets with probability p

        <t>A transport like RFC5681 TCP treats a congestion notification on
        any packet whatever its size as one event. However, a network with
        just the packet-mode drop algorithm does give more information if the
        transport chooses to use it. We will use <xref
        target="pktb_Tab_Absolute_and_Ratio"/> to illustrate this.</t>

        <t>We will set aside the last column until later. The columns labelled
        "Flow 1" and "Flow 2" compare two flows consisting of 60B and 1500B
        packets respectively. The body of the table considers two separate
        cases, one where the flows have equal bit-rate and the other with
        equal packet-rates. In both cases, the two flows fill a 96Mbps link.
        Therefore, in the equal bit-rate case they each have half the bit-rate
        (48Mbps). Whereas, with equal packet-rates, flow 1 uses 25 times
        smaller packets so it gets 25 times less bit-rate&mdash;it only gets
        1/(1+25) of the link capacity (96Mbps/26 = 4Mbps after rounding). In
        contrast flow 2 gets 25 times more bit-rate (92Mbps) in the equal
        packet rate case because its packets are 25 times larger. The packet
        rate shown for each flow could easily be derived once the bit-rate was
        known by dividing bit-rate by packet size, as shown in the column
        labelled "Formula".</t>

        <t>So far we have merely set up the scenarios. We now consider
        congestion notification in the scenario. Two TCP flows with the same
        round trip time aim to equalise their packet-loss-rates over time.
        That is the number of packets lost in a second, which is the packets
        per second (u) multiplied by the probability that each one is dropped
        (p). Thus TCP converges on the "Equal packet-rate" case, where both
        flows aim for the same "Absolute packet-loss-rate" (both 8pps in the
        table).</t>

        <t>Packet-mode drop actually gives flows sufficient information to
        measure their loss-rate in bits per second, if they choose, not just
        packets per second. Each flow can count the size of a lost or marked
        packet and scale its rate-response in proportion (as TFRC-SP does).
        The result is shown in the row entitled "Absolute bit-loss-rate",
        where the bits lost in a second is the packets per second (u)
        multiplied by the probability of losing a packet (p) multiplied by the
        packet size (s). Such an algorithm would try to remove any imbalance
        in bit-loss-rate such as the wide disparity in the "Equal packet-rate"
        case (4kbps vs. 92kbps). Instead, a packet-size-dependent algorithm
        would aim for equal bit-loss-rates, which would drive both flows
        towards the "Equal bit-rate" case, by driving them to equal
        bit-loss-rates (both 48kbps in this example).</t>

        <t>The explanation so far has assumed that each flow consists of
        packets of only one constant size. Nonetheless, it extends naturally
        to flows with mixed packet sizes. In the right-most column of <xref
        target="pktb_Tab_Absolute_and_Ratio"/> a flow of mixed size packets is
        created simply by considering flow 1 and flow 2 as a single aggregated
        flow. There is no need for a flow to maintain an average packet size.
        It is only necessary for the transport to scale its response to each
        congestion indication by the size of each individual lost (or marked)
        packet. Taking for example the "Equal packet-rate" case, in one second
        about 8 small packets and 8 large packets are lost (making closer to
        15 than 16 losses per second due to rounding). If the transport
        multiplies each loss by its size, in one second it responds to 8*480b
        and 8*12,000b lost bits, adding up to 96,000 lost bits in a second.
        This double checks correctly, being the same as 0.1% of the total
        bit-rate of 96Mbps. For completeness, the formula for absolute
        bit-loss-rate is p(u1*s1+u2*s2).</t>

        <t>Incidentally, a transport will always measure the loss probability
        the same irrespective of whether it measures in packets or in bytes.
        In other words, the ratio of lost to sent packets will be the same as
        the ratio of lost to sent bytes. (This is why TCP's bit rate is still
        proportional to packet size even when byte-counting is used, as
        recommended for TCP in <xref target="RFC5681"/>, mainly for orthogonal
        security reasons.) This is intuitively obvious by comparing two
        example flows; one with 60B packets, the other with 1500B packets. If
        both flows pass through a queue with drop probability 0.1%, each flow
        will lose 1 in 1,000 packets. In the stream of 60B packets the ratio
        of bytes lost to sent will be 60B in every 60,000B; and in the stream
        of 1500B packets, the loss ratio will be 1,500B out of 1,500,000B.
        When the transport responds to the ratio of lost to sent packets, it
        will measure the same ratio whether it measures in packets or bytes:
        0.1% in both cases. The fact that this ratio is the same whether
        measured in packets or bytes can be seen in <xref
        target="pktb_Tab_Absolute_and_Ratio"/>, where the ratio of lost to
        sent packets and the ratio of lost to sent bytes is always 0.1% in all
        cases (recall that the scenario was set up with p=0.1%).</t>

        <t>This discussion of how the ratio can be measured in packets or
        bytes is only raised here to highlight that it is irrelevant to this
        memo! Whether a transport depends on packet size or not depends on how
        this ratio is used within the congestion control algorithm.</t>

        <t>So far we have shown that packet-mode drop passes sufficient
        information to the transport layer so that the transport can take
        account of bit-congestion, by using the sizes of the packets that
        indicate congestion. We have also shown that the transport can choose
        not to take packet size into account if it wishes. We will now
        consider whether the transport can know which to do.</t>

               title="Bit-Congestible and Packet-Congestible Indications">
        <t>As a thought-experiment, imagine an idealised congestion
        notification protocol that supports both bit-congestible and
        packet-congestible resources. It would require at least two ECN flags,
        one for each of bit-congestible and packet-congestible resources.
        <list style="numbers">
            <t>A packet-congestible resource trying to code congestion level
            p_p into a packet stream should mark the idealised `packet
            congestion' field in each packet with probability p_p irrespective
            of the packet's size. The transport should then take a packet with
            the packet congestion field marked to mean just one mark,
            irrespective of the packet size.</t>

            <t>A bit-congestible resource trying to code time-varying
            byte-congestion level p_b into a packet stream should mark the
            `byte congestion' field in each packet with probability p_b, again
            irrespective of the packet's size. Unlike before, the transport
            should take a packet with the byte congestion field marked to
            count as a mark on each byte in the packet.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>This hides a fundamental problem&mdash;much more fundamental than
        whether we can magically create header space for yet another ECN flag,
        or whether it would work while being deployed incrementally.
        Distinguishing drop from delivery naturally provides just one implicit
        bit of congestion indication information&mdash;the packet is either
        dropped or not. It is hard to drop a packet in two ways that are
        distinguishable remotely. This is a similar problem to that of
        distinguishing wireless transmission losses from congestive
        losses.</t>

        <t>This problem would not be solved even if ECN were universally
        deployed. A congestion notification protocol must survive a transition
        from low levels of congestion to high. Marking two states is feasible
        with explicit marking, but much harder if packets are dropped. Also,
        it will not always be cost-effective to implement AQM at every low
        level resource, so drop will often have to suffice.</t>

        <t>We are not saying two ECN fields will be needed (and we are not
        saying that somehow a resource should be able to drop a packet in one
        of two different ways so that the transport can distinguish which sort
        of drop it was!). These two congestion notification channels are a
        conceptual device to illustrate a dilemma we could face in the future.
        <xref target="pktb_Motivation"/> gives four good reasons why it would
        be a bad idea to allow for packet size by biasing drop probability in
        favour of small packets within the network. The impracticality of our
        thought experiment shows that it will be hard to give transports a
        practical way to know whether to take account of the size of
        congestion indication packets or not.</t>

        <t>Fortunately, this dilemma is not pressing because by design most
        equipment becomes bit-congested before its packet-processing becomes
        congested (as already outlined in <xref target="pktb_term"/>).
        Therefore transports can be designed on the relatively sound
        assumption that a congestion indication will usually imply
        bit-congestion.</t>

        <t>Nonetheless, although the above idealised protocol isn't intended
        for implementation, we do want to emphasise that research is needed to
        predict whether there are good reasons to believe that packet
        congestion might become more common, and if so, to find a way to
        somehow distinguish between bit and packet congestion <xref
        target="RFC3714"/>.</t>

        <t>Recently, the dual resource queue (DRQ) proposal <xref
        target="DRQ"/> has been made on the premise that, as network
        processors become more cost effective, per packet operations will
        become more complex (irrespective of whether more function in the
        network is desirable). Consequently the premise is that CPU congestion
        will become more common. DRQ is a proposed modification to the RED
        algorithm that folds both bit congestion and packet congestion into
        one signal (either loss or ECN).</t>

        <t>Finally, we note one further complication. Strictly,
        packet-congestible resources are often cycle-congestible. For
        instance, for routing look-ups load depends on the complexity of each
        look-up and whether the pattern of arrivals is amenable to caching or
        not. This also reminds us that any solution must not require a
        forwarding engine to use excessive processor cycles in order to decide
        how to say it has no spare processor cycles.</t>

    <section anchor="pktb_Policing_Congestion_Response"
             title="Byte-mode Drop Complicates Policing Congestion Response">
      <t>This section is informative, not normative.</t>

      <t>There are two main classes of approach to policing congestion
      response: i) policing at each bottleneck link or ii) policing at the
      edges of networks. Packet-mode drop in RED is compatible with either,
      while byte-mode drop precludes edge policing.</t>

      <t>The simplicity of an edge policer relies on one dropped or marked
      packet being equivalent to another of the same size without having to
      know which link the drop or mark occurred at. However, the byte-mode
      drop algorithm has to depend on the local MTU of the line&mdash;it needs
      to use some concept of a 'normal' packet size. Therefore, one dropped or
      marked packet from a byte-mode drop algorithm is not necessarily
      equivalent to another from a different link. A policing function local
      to the link can know the local MTU where the congestion occurred.
      However, a policer at the edge of the network cannot, at least not
      without a lot of complexity.</t>

      <t>The early research proposals for type (i) policing at a bottleneck
      link <xref target="pBox"/> used byte-mode drop, then detected flows that
      contributed disproportionately to the number of packets dropped.
      However, with no extra complexity, later proposals used packet mode drop
      and looked for flows that contributed a disproportionate amount of
      dropped bytes <xref target="CHOKe_Var_Pkt"/>.</t>

      <t>Work is progressing on the congestion exposure protocol (ConEx <xref
      target="RFC6789"/>), which enables a type (ii) edge policer located at a
      user's attachment point. The idea is to be able to take an integrated
      view of the effect of all a user's traffic on any link in the
      internetwork. However, byte-mode drop would effectively preclude such
      edge policing because of the MTU issue above.</t>

      <t>Indeed, making drop probability depend on the size of the packets
      that bits happen to be divided into would simply encourage the bits to
      be divided into smaller packets in order to confuse policing. In
      contrast, as long as a dropped/marked packet is taken to mean that all
      the bytes in the packet are dropped/marked, a policer can remain robust
      against bits being re-divided into different size packets or across
      different size flows <xref target="Rate_fair_Dis"/>.</t>

              <t>Abstract, S.1, S.1.1, s.1.2 Intro, Scoping and Example: Made
              applicability to all AQMs clearer listing some more example AQMs
              and explained that we always use RED for examples, but this
              doesn't mean it's not applicable to other AQMs. [A number of
              reviewers have described the draft as "about RED"]</t>

              <t>S.1 &amp; S.2.1 Queue measurement: Explained that the choice
              between measuring the queue in packets or bytes is only relevant
              if measuring it in time units is infeasible [So as not to imply
              that we haven't noticed the advances made by PDPC &amp;

              <t>S.1.1. Terminology: Better explained why hybrid systems
              congested by both packets and bytes are often designed to be
              treated as bit-congestible [Richard Barnes].</t>

              <t>S.2.1. Queue measurement advice: Added examples. Added a

              <t>S2.2. Recommendation on Encoding Congestion Notification:
              Removed SHOULD treat packets equally, leaving only SHOULD NOT
              drop dependent on packet size, to avoid it sounding like we're
              saying QoS is not allowed. Pointed to possible app-specific
              legacy use of byte-mode as a counter-example that prevents us
              saying MUST NOT. [Pete Resnick]</t>

              <t>S.2.3. Recommendation on Responding to Congestion:
              capitalised the two SHOULDs in recommendations for TCP, and gave
              possible counter-examples. [noticed while dealing with Pete

              <t>S.4.2.1.2. Packet Size Bias Regardless of AQM: Largely
              re-written to reflect the earlier change in advice about

              equalising the bit rates of TCPs with different segment sizes.
              Removed some conjectured motivations.</t>

              <t>Added support for updates to TCP in progress (ackcc &amp;
              ecn-syn-ack).</t>

              <t>Updated survey results with newly arrived data.</t>

              <t>Pulled all recommendations together into the conclusions.</t>

              <t>Moved some detailed points into two additional appendices and
              a note.</t>

              <t>Considerable clarifications throughout.</t>

      <t>This document defines the procedures that the Internet Assigned
      Numbers Authority (IANA) uses when handling registration and other
      requests related to the transport protocol port number and service name
      registry. It also discusses the rationale and principles behind these
      procedures and how they facilitate the long-term sustainability of the
      registry.</t>

      <t>This document updates IANA's procedures by obsoleting Sections 8
      and 9.1 of the IANA allocation guidelines [RFC2780], it updates
      the IANA allocation procedures for UDP-Lite [RFC3828], DCCP [RFC4340] and SCTP [RFC4960], 
      it updates the DNS SRV specification [RFC2782] to clarify what a service name
      is and how it is registered.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>For many years, the allocation and registration of new port number
      values and service names for use with the Transmission Control Protocol
      (TCP) <xref target="RFC0793"/> and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
      <xref target="RFC0768"/> have had less than clear guidelines. New transport
      protocols have been added - the Stream Control Transmission Protocol
      (SCTP) <xref target="RFC4960"/> and the Datagram Congestion Control
      Protocol (DCCP) <xref target="RFC4342"/> - and new mechanisms like DNS SRV
      records <xref target="RFC2782"/> have been developed, each with separate
      registries and separate guidelines. The community recognized the need for
      additional procedures beyond just assignment; notably modification,
      revocation, and release.</t>

      <t>A key factor of this procedural streamlining is to establish
      identical registration procedures for all IETF transport protocols. This
      document brings the IANA procedures for TCP and UDP in line with those
      for SCTP and DCCP, resulting in a single process that requesters
      and IANA follow for all requests for all transport protocols, including
      those not yet defined.</t>

      <t>In addition to detailing the IANA procedures for the initial
      assignment of port numbers and service names, this document also
      specifies post-assignment procedures that until now have been handled in
      an ad hoc manner. These include procedures to de-register a port number
      that is no longer in use, to re-use a port number allocated for one
      application that is no longer in use for another application, and the
      procedure by which IANA can unilaterally revoke a prior port number
      registration. <xref target="iana-procedures"/> discusses the specifics
      of these procedures and processes that requesters and IANA follow for
      all requests for all current and future transport protocols.</t>

      <t>It is important to note that ownership of registered port numbers and
      service names remains with IANA. For protocols developed by IETF working
      groups, IANA now also offers a method for the "early" assignment of port
      numbers and service names <xref target="RFC4020"/>, as described in
      <xref target="registration"/>.</t>

      <t>This document updates IANA's procedures for UDP and TCP port numbers
      by obsoleting Sections 8 and 9.1 of the IANA allocation guidelines
      <xref target="RFC2780"/>. (Note that different sections of the IANA
      allocation guidelines, relating to the protocol field values in IPv4
      header, were also updated in February 2008 <xref target="RFC5237"/>.)
      This document also updates the IANA allocation procedures for DCCP
      <xref target="RFC4340"/> and SCTP <xref target="RFC4960"/>.</t>
      
      <t>The Lightweight User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite) <xref target="RFC5237"/>
      shares the port space with UDP. The UDP-Lite specification says: 
      "UDP-Lite uses the same set of port number values assigned by the IANA
      for use by UDP".  Thus the update of UDP procedures result in an update 
      also of the UDP-Lite procedures.</t>

      <t>This document also clarify what a service name is and how it
      is registered. This will impact the DNS SRV specification, 
      because that specification merely makes a brief mention
      that the symbolic names of services are defined in "Assigned Numbers"
      <xref target="RFC1700"/>, without stating to which section of that
      230-page document it refers. The DNS SRV specification may have been
      referring to the list of Port Assignments (known as /etc/services on
      Unix), or to the "Protocol And Service Names" section, or to both, or
      to some other section. Furthermore, "Assigned Numbers" is now obsolete
      <xref target="RFC3232"/> and has now been replaced by on-line registries
      <xref target="PORTREG"/><xref target="PROTSERVREG"/>. There are 
      additional updates and clarifications on how DNS SRV utilize the 
      Service name registry created in this document in 
      "Clarification of DNS SRV Owner Names" 
      <xref target="I-D.gudmundsson-dnsext-srv-clarify"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="motivation" title="Motivation">
      <t>Information about the registration procedures for the
      port registry has existed in three locations: the forms for requesting port
      number registrations on the IANA web site <xref target="SYSFORM"/>
      <xref target="USRFORM"/>, an introductory text section in the file
      listing the port number registrations themselves
      <xref target="PORTREG"/>,
      and two brief sections of the IANA Allocation Guidelines
      <xref target="RFC2780"/>.</t>

      <t>Similarly, the procedures surrounding service names have been
      historically unclear. Service names were originally created as mnemonic
      identifiers for port numbers without a well-defined syntax, beyond the
      14-character limit mentioned on the IANA website
      <xref target="SYSFORM"/> <xref target="USRFORM"/>.
      Even that length limit has not been consistently applied, and some
      assigned service names are 15 characters long. When service
      identification via DNS SRV RRs was introduced, the
      requirement by IANA to only assign service names and port numbers in
      combination, led to the creation of an ad hoc service name registry
      outside of the control of IANA <xref target="SRVREG"/>.</t>

      <!--
      This text duplicates what's said elsewhere in the document.
      I also don't think that RFC 0952 (DOD INTERNET HOST TABLE SPECIFICATION)
      sheds any light on this issue. -- SC
      <t>It has also been historically unclear if the "name" entries registered
      in the "Protocol and Service Names Registry" <xref target="PROTSERVREG"/>
      can be used as service names. <xref target="RFC0952"/> defines the names
      in that registry as either service names or protocol names. It is likely
      that these names has been interpreted as being valid service names and
      consequently have been used, e.g., in SRV records. This motivates why
      this document merges the 166 protocol and service names defined in that
      registry into the port number registry <xref target="PORTREG"/>.</t>
      -->

      <t>This document aggregates all this scattered information into a single
      reference that aligns and clearly defines the management procedures for
      both port numbers and service names. It gives more detailed guidance to
      prospective requesters of ports and service names than the existing
      documentation, and it streamlines the IANA procedures for the management
      of the registry, so that management requests can complete in a timely
      manner.</t>

      <t>This document defines rules for registration of service names without
      associated port numbers, for such usages as DNS SRV records
      <xref target="RFC2782"/>, which was
      not possible under the previous IANA procedures. The document
      also merges service name registrations from the non-IANA ad hoc registry
      <xref target="SRVREG"/> and from the the IANA "Protocol and Service
      Names" registry <xref target="PROTSERVREG"/> into the IANA "Port and
      Service Name" registry <xref target="PORTREG"/>, which from here on is
      the single authoritative registry for service names and port numbers.</t>

      <t>An additional purpose of this document is to describe the principles that
      guide the IETF and IANA in their role as the long-term joint stewards of
      the port number registry. TCP and UDP have been a remarkable success
      over the last decades. Thousands of applications and application-level
      protocols have registered ports and service names for their use, and
      there is every reason to believe that this trend will continue into the
      future. It is hence extremely important that management of the registry
      follow principles that ensure its long-term usefulness as a shared
      resource. <xref target="principles"/> discusses these principles
      in detail.

    <section title="Background">
      <t>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
      <xref target="RFC0793"/> and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
      <xref target="RFC0768"/> have enjoyed a remarkable success over the
      decades as the two most widely used transport protocols on the Internet.
      They have relied on the concept of "ports" as logical entities for
      Internet communication. Ports serve two purposes: first, they provide a
      demultiplexing identifier to differentiate transport sessions between
      the same pair of endpoints, and second, they may also identify the
      application protocol and associated service to which processes bind.
      Newer transport protocols, such as the Stream Control Transmission
      Protocol (SCTP) <xref target="RFC4960"/> and the Datagram
      Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) <xref target="RFC4342"/> have
      adopted the concept of ports for their communication sessions and use
      16-bit port numbers in the same way as TCP and UDP (and UDP-Lite
      <xref target="RFC3828"/>, a variant of UDP).</t>

      <t>Port numbers are the original and most widely used means for
      application and service identification on the Internet. Ports are 16-bit
      numbers, and the combination of source and destination port numbers
      together with the IP addresses of the communicating end systems uniquely
      identifies a session of a given transport protocol. Port numbers are
      also known by their corresponding service names such as "telnet" for
      port number 23 and "http" (and the "www" alias) for port number 80.</t>

      <t>Hosts running services, hosts accessing services on other hosts, and
      intermediate devices (such as firewalls and NATs) that restrict services
      need to agree on which service corresponds to a particular destination
      port. Although this is ultimately a local decision with meaning only
      between the endpoints of a connection, it is common for many services
      to have a default port upon which those servers usually listen,
      when possible, and these ports are recorded by the Internet
      Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) through the port number registry
      <xref target="PORTREG"/>.</t>

      <t>Over time, the assumption that a particular port number necessarily
      implies a particular service may become less true. For example, multiple
      instances of the same service on the same host cannot generally
      listen on the same port, and multiple hosts behind the same NAT
      gateway cannot all have a mapping for the same port on the
      external side of the NAT gateway, whether using static port
      mappings configured by hand by the user, or dynamic port
      mappings configured automatically using a port mapping protocol
      <xref target="I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp">NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP)
      </xref> or <xref target="IGD">Internet Gateway Device (IGD)</xref>.</t>

<!--
      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>When different background applications on a single computer each
          export a web-based user interface, (e.g. as done by the Common Unix
          Printing System <xref target="CUPS"/>) they cannot all get TCP
          port 80, especially if that computer is also hosting a conventional
          web site on TCP port 80. Consequently, a single host may have
          several different processes all answering HTTP requests of various
          kinds, on ports other than port 80.</t>

          <t>When different users are running multiple copies of the same
          application on a single computer, multiple instances of the
          application cannot listen on the same port at the same time.
          Consequently, applications of this kind need to be programmed to
          expect that they may not always be able to get the port they want,
          and may have to listen on an alternative port instead.</t>

          <t>When different computers in a home are using a NAT gateway to
          share a single IP address, the computers can request that the NAT
          gateway create port mappings to enable them to receive inbound
          connections <xref target="I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp"/><xref
          target="IGD"/>, but they can't all get the same external port
          at the same time. Consequently, some applications on some of those
          computers may be receiving inbound connections on port other than
          the port usually used for the service in question. As ISPs begin to
          deploy large-scale NAT, sharing a single IP address between multiple
          homes, it is likely to become even more common to have applications
          receiving connections on dynamically allocated ports.</t>
        </list></t>
-->
      <t>Applications either use numeric port numbers directly, look up port
      numbers based on service names via system calls such as getservbyname()
      on UNIX, look up port numbers by performing queries for DNS SRV records
      <xref target="RFC2782"/><xref target="I-D.cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd"/>
      or determine port numbers in a variety of other ways
      like the TCP Port Service Multiplexer (TCPMUX)
      <xref target="RFC1078"/>.</t>

      <t>Designers of applications and application-level protocols may apply
      to IANA for an assigned port number and service name for a specific
      application, and may - after successful registration - assume that no
      other application will use that port number or service name for its
      communication sessions. Alternatively, application designers may also
      ask for only an assigned service name, if their application does not
      require a fixed port number. The latter alternative is encouraged when
      possible, in order to conserve the more limited port number space. This
      includes, for example, applications that use DNS SRV records to look up
      port numbers at runtime.</t>

      There have been many proposals over the years for putting names

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
      this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 
      <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Service Names">
      <t>Service names are the unique key in the Port and Service Name
      registry. This unique symbolic name for a service may also be used for
      other purposes, such as in <xref target="RFC2782">DNS SRV records</xref>.
      Within the registry, this unique key ensures that different services can
      be unambiguously distinguished, thus preventing name collisions and
      avoiding confusion about who is the administrative contact for a particular
      entry.</t>

      <t>For each service name, there may exist zero or more associated port
      number assignments. A port number assignment associated with a service
      name contains the transport protocol, port number and possibly additional
      data, such as a DCCP service code.</t>

      <t>There may be more than one service name associated with a particular
      transport protocol and port. This SHOULD only occur when all such
      service names are aliases for the same service, such as with "http" and
      "www". In such cases, one of the service names MUST be designated primary,
      for use with mechanisms such as DNS SRV Records <xref target="RFC2782"/>,
      and the others MUST be designated as aliases of the primary service name.
      This is necessary so that all clients and servers using a service
      discovery mechanism use a consistent name by which to refer to a
      given service. Otherwise, if a server were to advertise that it
      supports the "www" service, and a client were to seek instances of
      the "http" service, that client would fail to discover that server,
      defeating the purpose of having a service discovery mechanism.</t>
      
      <t>Service names are assigned on a "first come, first served" basis, as
      described in <xref target="registration"/>. Names should be brief and
      informative, avoiding words or abbreviations that are redundant in the
      context of the registry (e.g., "port", "service", "protocol", etc.) Names
      referring to discovery services, e.g., using multicast or broadcast to
      identify endpoints capable of a given service, SHOULD use an easily
      identifiable suffix (e.g., "-disc").</t>
      
      <section  anchor="sec-syntax" title="Service Name Syntax">
      
      <t> Valid service names MUST contain only these US-ASCII 
      <xref target="ANSI.X3-4.1986"/> characters: letters from A to Z 
      and a to z, digits from 0 to 9, and hyphens ("-", ASCII 0x2D or 
      decimal 45).  They MUST be at least one character and no more than 
      fifteen characters long, MUST NOT begin or end with a hyphen, and 
      MUST NOT consist of only digits (in order to be distinguishable 
      from port numbers, which are typically written as all digits). </t>
      
      <t> The service name syntax MAY be used to validate a service name 
      string, but MUST NOT be used for any other purpose (e.g., 
      delineation). Any system that includes a service name inside a 
      longer string is itself responsible for delineating the service 
      name.  Such systems MUST NOT rely on the syntax of a service name 
      alone for such delineation. </t>

      <section title="Service Name Usage in DNS SRV Records">
      
      <t> The DNS SRV specification <xref target="RFC2782"/> requests 
      that the Service Label part of the owner name of DNS SRV records 
      includes a "Service" element, defined to be "the symbolic name of 
      the desired service", but did not state precisely which part of 
      the IANA database (i.e. STD 2 when RFC 2782 was written) serves as 
      a registry for standard service names.</t>

      <t> This document clarifies that the Service Label MUST be a 
      service name as defined herein. The service name SHOULD be 
      registered with IANA and recorded in the Service Names and Port 
      Numbers registry <xref target="PORTREG"/>.  This is needed to 
      ensure that only a single registry of Service Names exists and 
      name collisions can be avoided in the future.</t>

      <t> The details of the use of Service Names from <xref 
      target="PORTREG"/> in SRV Service Labels are specified in <xref 
      target="RFC2782"/> and the documents updating or replacing that 
      specification (see the companion document 
      <xref target="I-D.gudmundsson-dnsext-srv-clarify"/> for more 
      information).</t>

      <t> The details of how applications make use of DNS SRV should be 
      specified in the documentation set of the application/service.  In 
      the absense of such specification, prospective clients of a given 
      service should not assume the existence of SRV RRs for this 
      service or, if they have indications that this will be the case 
      (e.g., by configuration), must assume the unextended naming scheme 
      from <xref target="RFC2782"/> for service discovery with DNS SRV, 
      i.e., the Service Label is constructed from the Service Name 
      registered in <xref target="PORTREG"/> by prepending a single 
      underscore character ("_").</t>

    <section anchor="types" title="Port Number Ranges">
      <t>TCP, UDP, UDP-Lite, SCTP and DCCP use 16-bit namespaces for
      their port number registries. The port registries for all these
      transport protocols are subdivided into three ranges of numbers, and
      <xref target="variances"/> describes the IANA procedures for each
      range in detail:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>the Well Known Ports, also known as the System Ports, from 0-1023
          (assigned by IANA)</t>

          <t>the Registered Ports, also known as the User Ports, from
          1024-49151 (assigned by IANA)</t>

          <t>the Dynamic Ports, also known as the Private Ports, from
          49152-65535 (never assigned)</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>Of the assignable port ranges (Well Known and Registered, i.e., port
      numbers 0-49151), individual port numbers are in one of three states at
      any given time:</t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Assigned: Assigned port numbers are currently allocated to the
          service indicated in the registry.</t>

          <t>Unassigned: Unassigned port numbers are currently available for
          assignment upon request, as per the procedures outlined in this
          document.</t>

          <t>Reserved: Reserved port numbers are not available for regular
          assignment; they are "assigned to IANA" for special purposes.
          Reserved port numbers include values at the edges of each range,
          e.g., 0, 1023, 1024, etc., which may be used to extend these ranges
          or the overall port number space in the future.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>In order to keep the size of the registry manageable, IANA typically
      only records the Assigned and Reserved port numbers and service names in
      the registry. Unassigned values are typically not explicitly listed.</t>

      <t>As a data point, when this document was written, approximately 76% of
      the TCP and UDP Well Known Ports were assigned, and approximately 9% of
      the Registered Ports were assigned. (As noted, Dynamic Ports are never
      assigned.)</t>

      <section anchor="udptcpexp"
               title="Port Numbers and Service Names for Experimentation">
        <t>Of the Well Known ports, two TCP and UDP port numbers (1021 and
        1022), together with their respective service names ("exp1" and
        "exp2"), have been assigned for experimentation with new applications
        and application-layer protocols that require a port number in the
        assigned ports ranges <xref target="RFC4727"/>.</t>

        <t>Please refer to Sections 1 and 1.1 of "Assigning Experimental and
        Testing Numbers Considered Useful" <xref target="RFC3692"/> for
        how these experimental port numbers are to be used.
        <!-- I still think this could be useful to explicitly repeat - Lars
        Specifically, they
        SHOULD only be used for local experiments in controlled environments,
        and they SHOULD NOT be used on the global Internet. Many new
        applications and application-layer protocols can be experimented with
        without requiring a port in the Well Known or Registered ports range,
        by using port numbers in the Dynamic Ports range. -->
        </t>

        <t>This document registers the same two port numbers and service names
        for experimentation with new application-layer protocols over SCTP and
        DCCP in <xref target="sctpdccpexp"/>.</t>

        <t>Unfortunately, it can be difficult to limit access to these ports.
        Users SHOULD take measures to ensure that experimental ports are
        connecting to the intended process. For example, users of these
        experimental ports might include a 64-bit nonce, once on each segment
        of a message-oriented channel (e.g., UDP), or once at the beginning of
        a byte-stream (e.g., TCP), which is used to confirm that the port is
        being used as intended. Such confirmation of intended use is
        especially important when these ports are associated with privileged
        (e.g., system or administrator) processes.</t>

    <section anchor="principles"
             title="Principles for Port Number and Service Name Registry Management">

      <t>Management procedures for the port number and service name registry
      include allocation of port numbers and service names upon request, as
      well as coordination of information about existing allocations. The
      latter includes maintaining contact and description information about
      assignments, revoking abandoned assignments, and redefining assignments
      when needed. Of these procedures, port number allocation is most
      critical, in order to continue to conserve the remaining port
      numbers.</t>

      <t>As noted earlier, only ~9% of the Registered Port space is currently
      assigned. The current rate of assignment is approximately 400 ports/year,
      and has remained linear for the past 8 years. At that rate, if similar
      conservation continues, this resource will sustain another 85 years of
      assignment - without the need to resort to reassignment of released
      values or revocation. Note that the namespace available for service names
      is even larger, which allows for a simpler management procedures.</t>

    <section title="Past Principles">
      <t>Before the publication of this document, the principles of port number
      and service name management followed a few mostly-undocumented
      guidelines. They are recorded here for historical purposes, and this
      document updates them in <xref target="upprinc"/>. These principles
      were:</t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>TCP and UDP ports were simultaneously allocated when either was
          requested</t>

          <t>Port numbers were the primary allocation; service names were
          informative only, and did not have a well-defined syntax</t>

          <t>Port numbers were conserved informally, and sometimes
          inconsistently (e.g., some services were allocated ranges of many
          port numbers even where not strictly necessary)</t>

          <t>SCTP and DCCP port number and service name registries were
          managed separately from the TCP/UDP registries</t>

          <t>Service names could not be assigned in the ports registry without
          assigning a corresponding port number at the same time</t>
        </list>

      This document clarifies and aligns these guidelines
      in order to more conservatively manage the limited remaining port number
      space and to enable and promote the use of service names for service
      identification without associated port numbers, where possible.</t>

      <!--
      <t>Port numbers are intended to identify a service and
      enable process demultiplexing at an endpoint; uses beyond
      those basic requirements should be avoided
      <xref target="I-D.touch-tsvwg-port-guidelines"/>. This
      document also focuses on service names as a unique identifier,
      to increase the space available (from 4 bytes to 14), and to
      enable their use in the absence of corresponding port number
      assignments.

      <section title="Updated Principles" anchor="upprinc">
      
        <t>This section summarizes the basic principles by which IANA handles the
        Port and Service Name registry, and attempts
        to conserve the port number space. This description is intended to
        inform applicants requesting service names and port numbers. IANA decisions are not
        required to be bound to these principles, however; other factors may
        come into play, and exceptions may occur where deemed in the best
        interest of the Internet.</t>
      
        <t>IANA will begin assigning service names that do not request a
        corresponding port number allocation under a simple "First Come,
        First Served" policy <xref target="RFC5226"/>.
        IANA MAY, at its discretion, refer service name requests to
        "Expert Review" in cases of mass registrations or other
        situations where IANA believes expert review is advisable.</t>      

        <t>The basic principle of port number registry management is to
        conserve use of the port space where possible. Extensions to support
        larger port number spaces would require changing many core protocols
        of the current Internet in a way that would not be backward compatible
        and interfere with both current and legacy applications. To help 
        ensure this conservation the policy for any registration request for 
        port number allocations uses the "Expert Review" policy <xref target="RFC5226"/>.</t>

        <t>Conservation of the port number space is required because this
        space is a limited resource, applications are expected to participate
        in the traffic demultiplexing process where feasible. The port numbers
        are expected to encode as little information as possible that will
        still enable an application to perform further demultiplexing by
        itself. In particular:</t>

        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>IANA will allocate only one assigned port number per service or application</t>

            <t>IANA will allocate only one assigned port number for all versions of a service
            (e.g., running the service with or without a security
            mechanism, or for updated variants of a service)</t>

            <t>IANA will allocate only one assigned port number for all different types of
            device using or participating in the same service</t>

            <t>IANA will allocate port numbers only for the transport protocol(s)
            (if any) explicitly named in an registration request</t>

            <t>IANA may recover unused port numbers, via the new procedures of
            de-registration, revocation, and transfer</t>    
          </list>
        A given service is expected to further demultiplex messages where
        possible. For example, applications and protocols are expected to
        include in-band version information, so that future versions of the
        application or protocol can share the same allocated port.
        Applications and protocols are also expected to be able to efficiently
        use a single allocated port for multiple sessions, either by
        demultiplexing multiple streams within one port, or using the
        allocated port to coordinate using dynamic ports for subsequent
        exchanges (e.g., in the spirit of FTP <xref target="RFC0959"/>).</t>

        <!-- Removed until doc is available:
        These principles of port conservation are explained in
        <xref target="I-D.touch-tsvwg-port-guidelines"/>.
        That document explains in further detail how -->

        <t>Ports are used in various ways, notably:</t>

        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>as endpoint process identifiers</t>
            <t>as application protocol identifiers</t>
            <t>for firewall filtering purposes</t>
          </list>
        The process and protocol identifier use suggests that anything a
        single process can demultiplex, or that can be encoded into a single
        protocol, should be. The firewall filtering use suggests that some
        uses that could be multiplexed or encoded must be separated to
        allow for firewall management. Note that this latter use is much less
        sound, because port numbers have meaning only for the two endpoints
        involved in a connection, and drawing conclusions about the service
        that generated a given flow based on observed port numbers is
        not always reliable.
        <!-- (again, as discussed in detail in
        <xref target="I-D.touch-tsvwg-port-guidelines"/>).-->
        Further, previous separation of protocol variants based on security
        capabilities (e.g., HTTP on port 80 vs. HTTPS on port 443) is not
        recommended for new protocols, because all should be security-capable
        and capable of negotiating the use of security in-band.</t>

        <t>IANA will begin assigning protocol numbers for only those transport
        protocols explicitly included in a registration request. This ends the
        long-standing practice of automatically assigning a port number to an
        application for both TCP and a UDP, even if the request is for only
        one of these transport protocols. The new allocation procedure
        conserves resources by allocating a port number to an application for
        only those transport protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP and/or DCCP) it actually
        uses. The port number will be marked as Reserved - instead of Assigned
        - in the port number registries of the other transport protocols. When
        applications start supporting the use of some of those additional
        transport protocols, their implementors MUST request IANA to convert
        the reservation into an assignment. An application MUST NOT assume
        that it can use a port number assigned to it for use with one
        transport protocol with another transport protocol without asking IANA
        to convert the reservation into an assignment.</t>
        
        <t>When the available pool of unassigned address has run out in a port range, it will be 
        necessary for IANA to consider the Reserved ports for assignment. This
        is part of the motivation to not automatically assigning ports for other 
        transport protocols than the requested ones. This will allow more ports
        to be available for assignment at that point. It also shows the importance 
        to register the transport protocols that are in fact used.</t>

        <t>Conservation of port numbers is improved by procedures that allow
        previously allocated port numbers to become Unassigned, either through
        de-registration or through revocation, and by a procedure that lets
        application designers transfer an allocated but unused port number to
        a new application. <xref target="iana-procedures"/> describes
        these procedures, which so far were undocumented. Port number
        conservation is also improved by recommending that applications that
        do not require an allocated port chose this option and register only a
        service name.</t>

      <section anchor="variances"
               title="Variances for Specific Port Number Ranges">
        <t><xref target="types"/> describes the different port number
        ranges. It is important to note that IANA applies slightly different
        procedures when managing the different ranges of the port number
        registry:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Ports in the Dynamic Ports range (49152-65535) have been
            specifically set aside for local and dynamic use and cannot be
            registered through IANA. Applications may simply use them for
            communication without any sort of registration. On the other hand,
            applications MUST NOT assume that a specific port number in the
            Dynamic Ports range will always be available for communication at
            all times, and a port number in that range hence MUST NOT be used
            as a service identifier.</t>

            <t>Ports in the Registered Ports range (1024-49151) are available
            for registration through IANA, and MAY be used as service
            identifiers upon successful registration. Because registering a
            port number for a specific application consumes a fraction of the
            shared resource that is the port number registry, IANA will
            require the requester to document the intended use of the port
            number. This documentation will be input to the "Expert Review"
            allocation procedure <xref target="RFC5226"/>, by which IANA
            will have a technical expert review the request to determine
            whether to grant the registration. The submitted documentation
            MUST explain why using a port number in the Dynamic Ports range is
            unsuitable for the given application.</t>

            <t>Ports in the Well Known Ports range (0-1023) are also available
            for registration through IANA. Because the Well Known Ports range
            is both the smallest and the most densely allocated, the requirements
            for new allocations are more strict than those for the Registered Ports
            range, and will only be granted under the "IETF Review" allocation
            procedure <xref target="RFC5226"/>. A request for a Well
            Known port number MUST document why using a port number from both
            the Registered Ports and Dynamic Ports ranges is unsuitable for
            the given application.</t>

      <t>This section describes the process for requests associated with
      IANA's management of the port number and service name registry. Such
      requests include initial registration, de-registration, re-use, changes
      to the service name, as well as updates to the contact information or
      description associated with an assignment. Revocation is initiated by
      IANA.</t>

      <section anchor="registration"
               title="Port Number and Service Name Registration">
        <t>Registration refers to the allocation of port numbers or service
        names to applicants. All such registrations are made from port numbers
        or service names that are Unassigned or Reserved at the time of the
        allocation. Unassigned numbers and names are allocated as needed, and
        without further explanation. Reserved numbers and names are assigned
        only after review by IANA and the IETF, and are accompanied by a
        statement explaining the reason a Reserved number or name is
        appropriate for this action.</t>

        <t>When a registration for one or more transport
        protocols is approved, the port number for any non-requested transport
        protocol(s) will be marked as Reserved. IANA SHOULD NOT assign that
        port number to any other application or service until no other port
        numbers remain Unassigned in the requested range. The current
        administrative contact for a port number MAY register these Reserved port
        numbers for other transport protocols when needed.</t>

        <t>Service names, on the other hand, are not tied to a specific
        transport protocol, and registration requests for only a service name

            the currently Unassigned port number the requester suggests for
            allocation, or the text "ANY", MUST be provided. If only a service
            name is to be assigned, this field MUST be empty. If a specific port
            number is requested, IANA is encouraged to allocate the
            requested number. If the text "ANY" is specified, IANA will choose
            a suitable number from the Registered Ports range. Note that the
            applicant MUST NOT use the requested port prior to the completion
            of the registration<!-- or the IETF will be very very cross
            and will glare at you in a most disapproving manner-->.</t>

            <t>Transport Protocol(s): If assignment of a port number is
            desired, the transport protocol(s) for which the allocation
            is requested MUST be provided. This field is currently
            limited to one or more of TCP, UDP, SCTP, and DCCP.</t>

            <t>Service Code: The request MUST include a desired unique
            DCCP service code <xref target="RFC5595"/>
            if the registration request includes DCCP as a transport
            protocol, and MUST NOT include a requested DCCP service
            code otherwise.</t>

            <t>Description: A short description of the service associated with
            the registration request is REQUIRED. It should avoid all but the
            most well known acronyms.</t>

            <t>Reference: A description of (or a reference to a document
            describing) the protocol or application using this port.
            The description must include whether the protocol uses either
            broadcast, multicast, or anycast communication.
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            For registrations requesting only a Service Name or a
            Service Name and Registered Port, a statement that
            the protocol is proprietary and not publicly documented is
            also acceptable provided that the above information 
            regarding use of broadcast, multicast, or anycast is given.
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            For registration requests for a Registered Port, the
            registration request MUST explain why a port number in the
            Dynamic Ports range is unsuitable for the given application.
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            For registration requests for a Well Known Port, the
            registration request MUST explain why a port number in the
            Registered Ports or Dynamic Ports ranges is unsuitable,
            and a reference to a stable protocol specification document
            MUST be provided. For requests from IETF Working Groups,
            IANA MAY accept "Early" registration requests referencing a
            sufficiently stable Internet Draft instead of a published
            Standards-Track RFC <xref target="RFC4020"/>.</t>

        <t>When IANA receives a registration request containing the above
        information requesting a port number, IANA SHALL initiate an "Expert
        Review" <xref target="RFC5226"/> in order to determine whether an
        assignment should be made. For requests that do not include a
        port number, IANA SHOULD assign the service name under a simple
         "First Come First Served" policy <xref target="RFC5226"/>.</t>

      <section anchor="deregistration"
               title="Port Number and Service Name De-Registration">
        <t>The administrative contact of a granted port number assignment can
        return the port number to IANA at any time if they no longer have a
        need for it. The port number will be de-registered and will be marked
        as Reserved. IANA should not re-assign port numbers that have been
        de-registered until all other available port numbers in the specific
        range have been assigned.</t>

        <t>Before proceeding with a port number de-registration, IANA needs to
        reasonably establish that the value is actually no longer in use.</t>

        <t>Because there is much less danger of exhausting the service name
        space compared to the port number space, it is RECOMMENDED that a
        given service name remain assigned even after all associated port
        number assignments have become de-registered. Under this policy, it will
        appear in the registry as if it had been created through a service
        name registration request that did not include any port numbers.</t>

        <t>On rare occasions, it may still be useful to de-register a service
        name. In such cases, IANA will mark the service name as Reserved. IANA
        will involve their IESG-appointed expert in such cases.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="reuse" title="Port Number and Service Name Re-Use">
        <t>If the administrative contact of a granted port number assignment no
        longer have a need for the registered number, but would like to re-use
        it for a different application, they can submit a request to IANA to
        do so.</t>

        <t>Logically, port number re-use is to be thought of as a
        de-registration (<xref target="deregistration"/>) followed by an
        immediate re-registration (<xref target="registration"/>) of the same
        port number for a new application. Consequently, the information that
        needs to be provided about the proposed new use of the port number is
        identical to what would need to be provided for a new port number
        allocation for the specific ports range.</t>

        <t>Because there is much less danger of exhausting the service name
        space compared to the port number space, it is RECOMMENDED that the
        original service name associated with the prior use of the port number
        remains assigned, and a new service be created and associated with the
        port number. This is again consistent with viewing a re-use request as
        a de-registration followed by an immediate re-registration. Re-using
        an assigned service name for a different application is NOT
        RECOMMENDED.</t>

        <t>IANA needs to carefully review such requests before approving them.
        In some instances, the Expert Reviewer will determine that the
        application that the port number was assigned to has found usage
        beyond the original requester, or that there is a concern that it may
        have such users. This determination MUST be made quickly. A community
        call concerning revocation of a port number (see below) MAY be
        considered, if a broader use of the port number is suspected.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="revocation"
               title="Port Number and Service Name Revocation">
        <t>A port number revocation can be thought of as an IANA-initiated
        de-registration (<xref target="deregistration"/>), and has
        exactly the same effect on the registry.</t>

        <t>Sometimes, it will be clear that a specific port number is no
        longer in use and that IANA can revoke it and mark it as Reserved. At
        other times, it may be unclear whether a given assigned port number is
        still in use somewhere in the Internet. In those cases, IANA must
        carefully consider the consequences of revoking the port number, and
        SHOULD only do so if there is an overwhelming need.</t>

        <t>With the help of their IESG-appointed Expert Reviewer, IANA SHALL
        formulate a request to the IESG to issue a four-week community call
        concerning the pending port number revocation. The IESG and IANA, with
        the Expert Reviewer's support, SHALL determine promptly after the end
        of the community call whether revocation should proceed and then
        communicate their decision to the community. This procedure typically
        involves similar steps to de-registration except that it is initiated
        by IANA.</t>

        <t>Because there is much less danger of exhausting the service name
        space compared to the port number space, revoking service names is NOT
        RECOMMENDED.</t>

      <section anchor="transfer"

        <t>The value of port numbers and service names is defined by their
        careful management as a shared Internet resource, whereas enabling
        transfer allows the potential for associated monetary exchanges. As a
        result, the IETF does not permit port number or service name
        assignments to be transferred between parties, even when they are
        mutually consenting.</t>

        <t>The appropriate alternate procedure is a coordinated
        de-registration and registration: The new party requests the port
        number or service name via a registration and the previous party
        releases its assignment via the de-registration procedure outlined
        above.</t>

        <t>With the help of their IESG-appointed Expert Reviewer, IANA SHALL

    <section anchor="seccons" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The IANA guidelines described in this document do not change the
      security properties of UDP, TCP, SCTP, or DCCP.</t>

      <t><!-- adapted from http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers -->
      Assignment of a port number or service name does not in any way imply an
      endorsement of an application or product, and the fact that network
      traffic is flowing to or from a registered port number does not mean
      that it is "good" traffic, or even that it is used by the assigned
      service. Firewall and system administrators should choose how to
      configure their systems based on their knowledge of the traffic in
      question, not whether there is a port number or service name registered
      or not.</t>

      <t>Services are expected to include support for security, either as
      default or dynamically negotiated in-band. The use of separate port
      number or service name assignments for secure and insecure variants of
      the same service is to be avoided in order to discourage the deployment
      of insecure services.</t>

      <t>This document obsoletes Sections 8 and 9.1 of the March 2000 IANA
      Allocation Guidelines <xref target="RFC2780"/>.</t>

      <!-- This is trivia that belongs in an email messsage, not in a
      public document that exists in perpetuity. A year from now what
      people will care about is how to register their service, not a
      tedious exhaustive history of how it came to be that way.
      
      Lars says: No, it needs to be here, because all IANA actions need
      to be described in the document.
      -->
      
      <t>Upon approval of this document, IANA is requested to contact the
      maintainer of the <xref target="SRVREG"/> registry, in order to
      merge the contents of that private registry into the official IANA
      registry. It is expected that the contents of
      <xref target="SRVREG"/> will at that time be replaced with pointers to
      the IANA registry and to this RFC.</t>

      <t>IANA is instructed to create a new service name entry in
      the port number registry <xref target="PORTREG"/> for any entry in the
      "Protocol and Service Names" registry <xref target="PROTSERVREG"/> that
      does not already have one assigned.</t>

      <section anchor="consistency" title="Service Name Consistency">
        <t><xref target="registration"/> defines which character strings
        are well-formed service names, which until now had not been clearly
        defined. The definition in <xref target="registration"/> was
        chosen to allow maximum compatibility of service names with current
        and future service discovery mechanisms.</t>

        <t>As of August 5, 2009 approximately 98% of the so-called "Short
        Names" from existing port number registrations
        <xref target="PORTREG"/> meet the rules for legal service names
        stated in <xref target="registration"/>, and hence will be used
        unmodified.</t>

        <t>The remaining approximately 2% of the exiting "Short Names" are not
        suitable to be used directly as well-formed service names because they
        contain illegal characters such as asterisks, dots, plusses, slashes,
        or underscores. All existing "Short Names" conform to the length
        requirement of 15 characters or fewer. For these unsuitable "Short
        Names", listed in the table below, the service name will be the Short
        Name with any illegal characters replaced by hyphens. IANA SHALL add
        an entry to the registry giving the new well-formed primary
        service name for the existing service, that otherwise duplicates
        the original assignment information. In the description field of
        this new entry giving the primary service name, IANA SHALL record
        that it assigns a well-formed service name for the previous
        service and reference the original assignment. In the description
        field of the original assignment, IANA SHALL add a note that
        this entry is an alias to the new well-formed service name, and
        that the old service name is historic, not usable for use with many
        common service discovery mechanisms.</t>

        <section title="DCCP Service Code Registry">
          <t>Service Codes are allocated first-come-first-served according to
          Section 19.8 of the DCCP specification <xref target="RFC4340"/>.
          This document updates that section by extending the guidelines given
          there in the following ways:</t>

          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>IANA MAY assign new Service Codes without seeking Expert
              Review using their discretion, but SHOULD seek expert review if
              a request seeks more than five Service Codes.</t>

              <t>IANA should feel free to contact the DCCP Expert Reviewer
              with questions on any registry, regardless of the registry
              policy, for clarification or if there is a problem with a
              request <xref target="RFC4340"/>.</t>
            </list>
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title="DCCP Port Numbers Registry">
          <t>The DCCP ports registry is defined by Section 19.9 of the DCCP
          specification <xref target="RFC4340"/>. Allocations in this registry
          require prior allocation of a Service Code. Not all Service Codes
          require IANA-registered ports. This document updates that section by
          extending the guidelines given there in the following way:</t>

          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>IANA should normally assign a value in the range 1024-49151
              to a DCCP server port. IANA allocation requests to allocate port
              numbers in the Well Known Ports range (0 through 1023), require
              an "IETF Review" <xref target="RFC5226"/> prior to allocation by
              IANA <xref target="RFC4340"/>.</t>

              <t>IANA MUST NOT allocate a single Service Code value to more
              than one DCCP server port.</t>

              <t>The set of Service Code values associated with a DCCP server
              port should be recorded in the ports registry.</t>

              <t>A request for additional Service Codes to be associated with
              an already allocated Port Number requires Expert Review. These
              requests will normally be accepted when they originate from the
              contact associated with the port registration. In other cases,
              these applications will be expected to use an unallocated port,
              when this is available.</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>The DCCP specification <xref target="RFC4340"/> notes that
          a short port name MUST be associated with each DCCP server port that
          has been registered. This document requires that this name MUST be
          unique.</t>

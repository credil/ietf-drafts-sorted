    <abstract>
      <t>New fields are occasionally added to civic addresses.  A backwardly-compatible mechanism for adding civic address elements to the Geopriv 
      civic address format is described.  A formal mechanism for handling unsupported extensions when translating between XML and DHCP civic address 
      forms is defined for entities that need to perform this translation. Intial extensions for some new elements are also defined.  The LoST (RFC5222) protocol
	  mechanism that returns civic address element names used for validation of location information is clarified and is normatively updated to 
	  require a qualifying namespace identifier on each civic address element returned as part of the validation process.
      </t>

    </abstract>
  </front>
  <middle>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>The Geopriv civic location specifications (<xref target="RFC4776"/>, <xref target="RFC5139"/>) define an XML and binary representations for civic addresses that 
      allow for the expression of civic addresses.  Guidance for the use of these formats for the civic addresses in different countries is included in <xref target="RFC5774"/>.
      </t>

      <t>Subsequent to these specifications being produced, use cases for extending the civic address format with new elements have emerged.  Extension elements do not 
      readily fit existing elements, as recommended in <xref target="RFC5774"/>.
      </t>

      <t>The <xref target="RFC5139">XML format for civic addresses</xref> provides a mechanism that allows for the addition of standardized or privately understood 
      elements.  A similar facility for private extension is not provided for <xref target="RFC4776">the DHCP format</xref>, though new specifications are able to define 
	  new CAtypes (civic address types).
      </t>

      <t>A recipient of a civic address in either format currently has no option other than to ignore elements that it does not understand.  This results 
      in any elements that are unknown to that recipient being discarded if a recipient performs a translation between the two formats.  In order for a new 
      extension to be preserved through translation by any recipient, the recipient has to understand the extension and know how to correlate an XML element with a CAtype.
      </t>

      <t>This document describes how new civic address elements are added.  Extensions always starts with the definition of XML elements.   
      A mechanism for carrying the extension in the DHCP format is described. A new XML namespace containing a small number of additional civic elements is also defined and can be used
      as a template to illustrate how other extensions can be defined as required.
      </t>

      <t>These mechanisms ensure that any translation between formats can be performed consistently and without loss of information.
      Translation between formats can occur without knowledge of every extension that is present.
      </t>
	  
	  <t>The registry of numeric CAtypes is modified so that creators of extensions can advertise new namespaces and the 
	  civic elements to encourage maximum reuse.
      </t>

      <t>The additions described in this document are backwardly compatible.  Existing implementations may cause extension information to be lost,
      but the presence of extensions does not affect an implementation that conforms to either <xref target="RFC4776"/> or <xref target="RFC5139"/>.
      </t>
	  
	  <t>This document also normatively updates <xref target="RFC5222"/> to clarify that the namespace must be included with the element name in the lists of valid, invalid 
	  and not checked elements in the &lt;locationValidation&gt; part of a LoST response.  While the LoST schema does not need to be changed, the example in the document is 
	  updated to show the namespaces in the lists.
	  </t>

      <section title="Motivating Example">
        <t>One instance where translation might be necessary is where a device receives location configuration using <xref target="RFC4776">DHCP</xref>.  
        Conversion of DHCP information to an XML form is necessary if the device wishes to use the DHCP-provided information in a range of applications, including 
        <xref target="RFC4079">location-based presence services</xref>, and <xref target="RFC5012">emergency calling</xref>.
        </t>

        <figure anchor="convert" title="Conversion Scenario"><artwork><![CDATA[
 +--------+          +--------+         +-----------+

 +--------+          +--------+         +-----------+
]]></artwork></figure>

        <t>The Device that performs the translation between the DHCP and XML formats might not be aware of some of the extensions that are in use.  
        Without knowledge of these extensions and how they are represented in XML, the Device is forced to discard them.
        </t>

        <t>These extensions could be useful, or may be critical, to the ultimate consumers of this information.  For instance, an extension 
        element might provide a presence watcher with important information in locating the Device, or an extension might be 
	significant in choosing a particular call route.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>


    <section anchor="extend" title="Specifying Civic Address Extensions">
      <t>The civic schema in <xref target="RFC5139"/> defines an ordered structure of elements that can be combined to describe a civic address.  
      The XML extension point at the end of this sequence is used to extend the address.
      </t>

      <t>New elements are defined in a new <xref target="XMLNS">XML namespace</xref>.  This is true of address elements with significance within private or 
      localized domains, as well as those that are intended for global applicability.
      </t>

      <t>New elements SHOULD use the basic <spanx style="verb">caType</spanx> schema type defined in <xref target="RFC5139"/>.  This type provides an optional <spanx style="verb">xml:lang</spanx> attribute.
      </t>

      <t>For example, suppose the (fictitious) Central Devon Canals Authority wishes to introduce a new civic element called "bridge".  The authority defines an XML namespace that includes a "bridge" element.  The namespace needs to be a unique URI, for example <spanx style="verb">http://devon.canals.org.uk/civic</spanx>.
      </t>

      <t>A civic address that includes the new "bridge" element is shown in <xref target="localcivic2"/>.
      </t>

      <figure anchor="localcivic2" title="Extended Civic Address Example">

   </civicAddress>
]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>An entity that receives this location information might not understand the extension address element.  As long as the added element is able to be safely ignored, 
	  the remainder of the civic address can be used.  The result is that the information is not as useful as it could be, but the added element does not prevent the use of 
	  the remainder of the address.
      </t>

      <t>The address can be passed to other applications, such as a <xref target="RFC5222">LoST server</xref>, without modification.  If the application understands the 
	  added element(s), it is able to make use of that information.  For example, if this civic address is acquired using <xref target="RFC5985">HELD</xref>, it can be 
	  included in a LoST request directly.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Translating Unsupported Elements">
      <t>Unsupported civic address elements can be carried without consequence only as long as the format of the address does not change.  When converting between the 
	  XML and DHCP formats, these unsupported elements are necessarily discarded: the entity performing the translation has no way to know the correct element to use 
	  in the target format.
      </t>

      <t>All extensions MUST be defined using the mechanism described in this document.  Extensions that use numeric CAtypes or other mechanisms cannot be safely 
	  translated between XML and DHCP representations.
      </t>

      <t>An entity that does not support these extension mechanisms is expected to remove elements it doesn't understand when performing conversions.

        <t>The extension CAtype (CAtype code XX) [Note to IANA/RFC-Editor: please replace XX here and in the figure below with the assigned code] includes

        <t>The content of a CAtype (after the CAtype code and length) is UTF-8 encoded Unicode text <xref target="RFC3629"/>.  A maximum of 255 octets is allowed.  
		Octets consumed by the namespace URI and local name reduce the space available for values.
        </t>

        <t>This conversion only works for elements that have textual content and an optional <spanx style="verb">xml:lang</spanx> attribute.  Elements with complex 
		content or other attributes - aside from namespace bindings - MUST be ignored if they are not understood.

      <section title="DHCP to XML Format Translation">
        <t>The registration of a new CAtype following the process in <xref target="RFC4776"/> means that a recipient that does not know the equivalent XML is unable

		of numeric CAtypes can be made.
        </t>

        <t>In lieu of making new numerical CAtype assignments, this document creates a new extensionCA type which is defined in a manner that lets new civic elements be described in 
              DHCP form by carrying the name space and type name of the extension in parameters of the extensionCA type.
        </t>

        <t>When converting to XML, the namespace prefix used for the extension element is selected by the entity that performs the conversion.

	<section title="CAtypes Registry">
	<t><xref target="RFC4776"/> created the CAtype registry.  Among other things, this registry advertised available civic elements.  While it has always been possible to use an 
	extension namespace to define civic elements that are not in the CAtype registry, and this document does not change that, the registry is valuable to alert implementors of
	commonly used civic elements and provides guidance to clients of what elements they should suppport.
	</t>
	<t>This document alters the CAtype registry in several ways.  It closes the registry to new numeric CAtypes.  It deletes the "NENA" column,
       which is not needed.  It adds columns for a namespace and contact, and changes the name of the column currently called "PIDF" to "Local
       Name".  It also adds a column to the registry called "Type".  "Type" can have one of two values "A" and "B".  Type A elements are intended
       for wide use with many applications and SHOULD be implemented by all clients unless the client is certain the element will not be
       encountered.  Type "B" civic elements MAY be implemented by any client.

<section anchor="lost" title="Using Local Civic Extension with the LoST Protocol">

    <t>One critical use of civic location information is in next generation emergency services applications, in particular
       call routing applications. In such cases location information is provided to a location-based routing service using the
       location to service transtion (LoST) protcol <xref target="RFC5222"/>. LoST is used to provide call routing information,
        but it is also used to validate location information to ensure that it can route to an emergency center when required.
    </t>
    <t>LoST is an XML-based protocol and so the namespace extension mechansims described in this document do not impact LoST.
       When LoST is used for validation a &lt;locationValidation&gt; element is returned containing a list of valid, a list of invalid, 
       and a list of unchecked civic elements. <xref target="broken-fig"/> is an extract of the validation response in Figure 6 from 
       <xref target="RFC5222"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
    <figure anchor="broken-fig" title="Location Validation Example from LoST (RFC5222)">
            <artwork><![CDATA[
<locationValidation>
    <valid>country A1 A3 A6</valid>
    <invalid>PC</invalid>
    <unchecked>HNO</unchecked>
</locationValidation>
]]></artwork>
          </figure>
    </t>
    <t>The RelaxNG schema in <xref target="RFC5222"/> requires the elements in each of these lists to be namespace qualified,
       which makes the example in Figure 6 from <xref target="RFC5222"/> in error. This issue is especially significant when
       local-civic extensions are used as the domain to which the extensions are attributed may impact their interpretation by
       the server or client. To ensure that local-civic extensions do not cause issues with LoST server and client implementations,
       all elements listed in a &lt;valid&gt;, &lt;invalid&gt;, or &lt;unchecked&gt; element MUST be qualified with a namespace. To
       illustrate this the extract above from figure 6 in <xref target="RFC5222"/> becomes <xref target="corrected-fig"/>.

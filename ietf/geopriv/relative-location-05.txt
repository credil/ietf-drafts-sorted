                    Relative Location Representation
                draft-ietf-geopriv-relative-location-05

Abstract

   This document defines an extension to PIDF-LO (RFC4119) for the
   expression of location information that is defined relative to a
   reference point.  The reference point may be expressed as a geodetic
   or civic location, and the relative offset may be one of several
   shapes.  An alternative binary representation is described.

   Optionally, a reference to a secondary document (such as a map image)
   can be included, along with the relationship of the map coordinate
   system to the reference/offset coordinate system to allow display of
   the map with the reference point and the relative offset.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a format for the expression of relative
   location information.

   A relative location is formed of a reference location, plus a
   relative offset from that reference location.  The reference location
   can be represented in either civic or geodetic form.  The reference
   location can also have dynamic components such as velocity.  The
   relative offset is specified in meters using a Cartesian coordinate
   system.

   In addition to the relative location, an optional URI can be provided
   to a document that contains a map, floorplan or illustration.
   Applications could use this information to display the relative
   location.  Additional fields allow the map to be oriented and scaled
   correctly.

   Two formats are included: an XML form that is intended for use in
   PIDF-LO [RFC4119] and a TLV format for use in other protocols such as
   those that already convey binary representation of location
   information defined in [RFC4776].

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Overview

   This document describes an extension to PIDF-LO [RFC4119] as updated
   by [RFC5139] and [RFC5491], to allow the expression of a location as
   an offset relative to a reference.

                Relative
                Location


   This extension allows the creator of a location object to include two
   location values plus an offset.  A "baseline" location is included
   outside of the <relative-location> element.  The baseline location is
   visible to a client that does not understand relative location (i.e.,
   it ignores the <relative-location> element).

   A client that does understand relative location will interpret the
   location within the relative element as a refinement of the baseline
   location.  A relative location is determined, which gives the
   reference location for the relative offset.

   Creators of location objects with relative location thus have a
   choice of how much information to put into the "baseline" location
   and how much to put into the "reference" location.  For example, all
   location information could be put inside the <relative-location>
   element, so that clients that do not understand relative location
   would receive no location information at all.  Alternatively, the
   baseline location value could be precise enough to specify a building
   that contains the relative location, and the reference location could
   specify a point within the building from which the offset is
   measured.

   The baseline location SHOULD be general enough to describe both the
   reference location and the relative location (reference plus offset).
   Location objects SHOULD NOT have all location information in the
   baseline location.  Doing this would cause clients that do not
   understand relative location to incorrectly interpret the baseline
   location (i.e., the reference point) as the actual, precise location
   of the client.

   It is possible to provide a valid relative location with no
   information in the baseline.  However, this provides recipients who
   do not understand relative location with no information.  A baseline
   location SHOULD include sufficient information to encompass both the
   reference and relative locations while providing a baseline that is
   as accurate as possible.

   Both the baseline and the reference location are defined either as a
   geodetic location [OGC.GeoShape] or a civic address [RFC4776].  If
   the baseline location was expressed as a geodetic location, the
   reference MUST be geodetic.  If the baseline location was expressed
   as a civic address, the reference MUST be a civic.

   Baseline and reference locations MAY also include dynamic location
   information [RFC5962].

   The relative location can be expressed using a point (2- or
   3-dimensional), or a shape that includes uncertainty: circle, sphere,
   ellipse, ellipsoid, polygon, prism or arc-band.  Descriptions of
   these shapes can be found in [RFC5491].

   Optionally, a reference to a 'map' document can be provided.  The
   reference is a URI.  The document could be an image or dataset that
   represents a map, floorplan or other form.  The type of document the
   URI points to is described as a MIME media type.  Metadata in the
   relative location can include the location of the reference point in
   the map as well as an orientation (angle from North) and scale to
   align the document Co-ordinate Reference System (CRS) with the WGS84
   [WGS84] CRS.  The document is assumed to be useable by the
   application receiving the PIDF with the relative location to locate
   the reference point in the map.  This document does not describe any
   mechanisms for displaying or manipulating the document other than
   providing the reference location, orientation and scale.

   As an example, consider a relative location expressed as a point,
   relative to a civic location:

4.  Relative Location

   Relative location is a shape (e.g., point, circle, ellipse).  The
   shape is defined with a CRS that has a datum defined as the reference
   (which appears as a civic address or geodetic location in the tuple),
   and the shape coordinates as meter offsets North/East of the datum
   measured in meters (with an optional Z offset relative to datum
   altitude).  An optional angle allows the reference CRS be to rotated
   with respect to North.

4.1.  Relative Coordinate System

   The relative coordinate reference system uses a coordinate system
   with two or three axes.

   The baseline and reference locations are used to define a relative
   datum.  The reference location defines the origin of the coordinate
   system.  The centroid of the reference location is used when the
   reference location contains any uncertainty.

   The axes in this coordinate system are originally oriented based on
   the directions of East, North and Up from the reference location: the
   first (x) axis increases to the East, the second (y) axis points
   North, and the optional third (z) axis points Up.  All axes of the
   coordinate system use meters as a basic unit.

   Any coordinates in the relative shapes use the described Cartesian
   coordinate system.  In the XML form, this uses a URN of
   "urn:ietf:params:geopriv:relative:2d" for two-dimensional shapes and
   "urn:ietf:params:geopriv:relative:3d" for three-dimensional shapes.
   The binary form uses different shape type identifiers for 2D and 3D
   shapes.

   Dynamic location information [RFC5962] in the baseline or reference
   location alters relative coordinate system.  The resulting Cartesian
   coordinate system axes are rotated so that the "y" axis is oriented
   along the direction described by the <orientation> element.  The
   coordinate system also moves as described by the <speed> and
   <heading> elements.

4.2.  Placement of XML Elements

   The baseline of the reference location is represented as <location-
   info> like a normal PIDF-LO.  Relative location adds a new <relative-
   location> element to <location-info>.  Within <relative-location>,
   <reference> and <offset> elements are described.  Within <offset> are
   the shape elements described below.  This document extends PIDF-LO as
   described in [RFC6848].

4.3.  Binary Format

   This document describes a way to encode the relative location in a
   binary TLV form for use in other protocols that use TLVs to represent
   location.

   A type-length-value encoding is used.

   +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
   | Type |Length|  Value                         ...
   +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
   |  T   |  N   |  Value                         ...
   +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+

                        Figure 1: TLV-tuple format

   Type field (T) is an 8-bit unsigned integer.  The type codes used are
   registered an IANA-managed "Relative Location Parameters" registry
   defined by this document, and restricted to not include the values
   defined by the "CAtypes" registry.  This restriction permits a
   location reference and offset to be coded within the same object
   without type collisions.

   The Length field (N) is defined as an 8-bit unsigned integer.  This
   field can encode values from 0 to 255.  The length field describes
   the number of bytes in the Value.  Length does not count the bytes
   used for the Type or Length.

   The Value field is defined separately for each type.

   Each element of the relative location has a unique TLV assignment.  A
   relative location encoded in TLV form includes both baseline and
   reference location TLVs and a reference location TLVs.  The reference
   TLVs are followed by the relative offset, and optional map TLDs
   described in this document.

4.4.  Distances and Angles

   All distance measures used in shapes are expressed in meters.

   All orientation angles used in shapes are expressed in degrees.
   Orientation angles are measured from WGS84 Northing to Easting with
   zero at Northing.  Orientation angles in the relative coordinate
   system start from the second coordinate axis (y or Northing) and
   increase toward the first axis (x or Easting).

4.5.  Value Encoding

Internet-Draft              Relative Location                  June 2013


   The binary form uses single-precision floating point values IEEE 754
   [IEEE.754] to represent coordinates, distance and angle measures.
   Single precision values are 32-bit values with a sign bit, 8 exponent
   bits and 23 fractional bits.

   Binary-encoded coordinate values are considered to be a single value
   without uncertainty.  When encoding a value that cannot be exactly
   represented, the best approximation MUST be selected according to
   [Clinger1990].

4.6.  Relative Location Restrictions

   More than one relative shape MUST NOT be included in either a PIDF-LO
   or TLV encoding of location for a given reference point.

   Any error in the reference point transfers to the location described
   by the relative location.  Any errors arising from an implementation
   not supporting or understanding elements of the reference point
   directly increases the error (or uncertainty) in the resulting
   location.

4.7.  Baseline TLVs

   Baseline locations are described using the formats defined in
   [RFC4776] or [RFC6225].

4.8.  Reference TLV

   When a reference is encoded in binary form, the baseline and
   reference locations are combined in a reference TLV.  This TLV
   contains civic address TLVs (if the baseline was a civic) or geo TLVs
   (if the baseline was a geo).

4.9.  Shapes

   Shape data is used to represent regions of uncertainty for the
   reference and relative locations.  Shape data in the reference
   location uses a WGS84 [WGS84] CRS.  Shape data in the relative
   location uses a relative CRS.

   The XML form for shapes uses Geography Markup Language (GML)
   [OGC.GML-3.1.1], consistent with the rules in [RFC5491].  Reference

   locations use the CRS URNs specified in [RFC5491]; relative locations
   use either a 2D CRS (urn:ietf:params:geopriv:relative:2d), or a 3D
   (urn:ietf:params:geopriv:relative:3d), depending on the shape type.

   The binary form of each shape uses a different shape type for 2d and
   3d shapes.

   Nine shape type codes are defined.

4.9.1.  Point

   A point "shape" describes a single point with unknown uncertainty.
   It consists of a single set of coordinates.

   In a two-dimensional CRS, the coordinate includes two values; in a
   three-dimensional CRS, the coordinate includes three values.

4.9.1.1.  XML encoding

   A point is represented in GML using the following template:

   <gml:Point xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml"
              srsName="$CRS-URN$">
     <gml:pos>$Coordinate-1 $Coordinate-2$ $Coordinate-3$</gml:pos>
   </gml:Point>

                            GML Point Template

   Where "$CRS-URN$" is replaced by a
   urn:ietf:params:geopriv:relative:2d or
   urn:ietf:params:geopriv:relative:3d and "$Coordinate-3$" is omitted
   if the CRS is two-dimensional.

4.9.1.2.  TLV encoding

   The point shape is introduced by a TLV of 113 for a 2D point and 114
   for a 3D point.

4.9.2.  Circle or Sphere Shape

   A circle or sphere describes a single point with a single uncertainty
   value in meters.

   In a two-dimensional CRS, the coordinate includes two values and the
   resulting shape forms a circle.  In a three-dimensional CRS, the
   coordinate includes three values and the resulting shape forms a
   sphere.

4.9.2.1.  XML encoding

   A circle is represented in and converted from GML using the following
   template:

4.9.3.  Ellipse or Ellipsoid Shape

   A ellipse or ellipsoid describes a point with an elliptical or
   ellipsoidal uncertainty region.

   In a two-dimensional CRS, the coordinate includes two values, plus a
   semi-major axis, a semi-minor axis, a semi-major axis orientation
   (clockwise from North).  In a three-dimensional CRS, the coordinate
   includes three values and in addition to the two-dimensional values,
   an altitude uncertainty (semi-vertical) is added.

4.9.4.  Polygon or Prism Shape

   A polygon or prism include a number of points that describe the outer
   boundary of an uncertainty region.  A prism also includes an altitude
   for each point and prism height.

   At least 3 points MUST be included in a polygon.  In order to
   interoperate with existing systems, an encoding SHOULD include 15 or
   fewer points, unless the recipient is known to support larger
   numbers.

   Alternatively, a series of "pos" elements can be used in place of the
   single "posList".  Each "pos" element contains two or three
   coordinate values.

   Note that the first point is repeated at the end of the sequence of
   coordinates and no explicit count of the number of points is
   provided.

   A GML polygon that includes altitude cannot be represented perfectly
   in TLV form.  When converting to the binary representation, a two
   dimensional CRS is used and altitude is removed from each coordinate.

   A prism is represented in and converted from GML using the following
   template:

   duplicated point is removed from the binary form.

   A arc-band describes a region constrained by a range of angles and
   distances from a predetermined point.  This shape can only be

   Distance and angular measures are defined in meters and degrees
   respectively.  Both are encoded as single precision floating point
   values.

   The optional "map" URL can be used to provide a user of relative
   location with a visual reference for the location information.  This
   document does not describe how the recipient uses the map nor how it
   locates the reference or offset within the map.  Maps can be simple
   images, vector files, 2-D or 3-D geospatial databases, or any other
   form of representation understood by both the sender and recipient.

4.11.1.  Map URL

   In XML, the map is a <map> element defined within <relative-location>
   and contains the URL.  The URL is encoded as a UTF-8 encoded string.
   An "http:" or "https:" URL MUST be used unless the entity creating
   the PIDF-LO is able to ensure that authorized recipients of this data
   are able to use other URI schemes.  A "type" attribute MUST be
   present and specifies the kind of map the URL points to.  Map types
   are specified as MIME media types as recorded in the IANA Media Types
   registry.  For example <map type="image/png">https://www.example.com/
   floorplans/123South/floor-2</map>.

   In binary, the map type is a separate TLV from the map URL:

   +------+------+------+------+------+--  --+------+
   |  126 |Length|   Map Media Type               ...

                               Map URL TLVs

4.11.2.  Map Coordinate Reference System

   The CRS used by the map depends on the type of map.  For example, a
   map described by a 3-D geometric model of the building may contain a
   complete CRS description in it.  For some kinds of maps, typically
   described as images, the CRS used within the map must define the
   following:

   o  The CRS origin

   o  The CRS axes used and their orientation

   o  The unit of measure used

   This document provides elements that allow for a mapping between the
   local coordinate reference system used for the relative location and
   the coordinate reference system used for the map where they are not
   the same.

4.11.2.1.  Map Reference Point Offset

   This optional element identifies the coordinates of the reference
   point as it appears in the map.  This value is measured in a map-type
   dependent manner, using the coordinate system of the map.

   For image maps, coordinates start from the upper left corner and
   coordinates are first counted by column with positive values to the
   right; then rows are counted with positive values toward the bottom
   of the image.  For such an image, the first item is columns, the
   second rows and any third value applies to any third dimension used
   in the image coordinate space.

   The <offset> element contains 2 (or 3) coordinates similar to a GML
   "pos", For example:

     <offset> 2670.0 1124.0 1022.0</offset>

                    Map Reference Point Coordinates TLV

   If omitted, a value containing all zeros is assumed.  If the
   coordinates provided contain fewer values than are needed, the first
   value from the set is applied in place of any missing values.

4.11.2.2.  Map Orientation

   The map orientation includes the orientation of the map direction in
   relation to the Earth.  Map orientation is expressed relative to the
   orientation of the relative coordinate system.  This means that map
   orientation with respect to WGS84 North is the sum of the orientation
   field, plus any orientation included in a dynamic portion of the
   reference location.  Both values default to zero if no value is
   specified.

   This type uses a single precision floating point value of degrees
   relative to North.

   In XML, the <orientation> element contains a single floating point
   value, example <orientation>67.00</orientation>.  In TLV form:

   +------+------+------+------+------+------+
   |  129 |Length|  Angle                    |
   +------+------+------+------+------+------+

                            Map Orientation TLV

4.11.2.3.  Map Scale

   The optional map scale describes the relationship between the units
   of measure used in the map, relative to the meters unit used in the
   relative coordinate system.

   This type uses a sequence of IEEE 754 [IEEE.754] single precision
   floating point values to represent scale as a sequence of numeric
   values.  The units of these values are dependent on the type of map,
   and could for example be pixels per meter for an image.

   A scaling factor is provided for each axis in the coordinate system.
   For a two-dimensional coordinate system, two values are included to
   allow for different scaling along the x and y axes independently.
   For a three-dimensional coordinate system, three values are specified
   for the x, y and z axes.  Decoders can determine the number of
   scaling factors by examining the length field.

   Alternatively, a single scaling value MAY be used to apply the same
   scaling factor to all coordinate components.

   Images that use a rows/columns coordinate system often use a left-
   handed coordinate system.  A negative value for the y/rows-axis
   scaling value can be used to account for any change in direction
   between the y-axis used in the relative coordinate system and the
   rows axis of the image coordinate system.

   In XML, the <scale> element MAY contain a single scale value, or MAY
   contain 2 (or 3) values in XML list form.  In TLV form, the length of
   the TLV determines how many scale values are present:

   +------+------+------+------+------+------+
   |  130 |Length|  Scale(s)               ...
   +------+------+------+------+------+------+

7.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a data format.  To a large extent, security
   properties of this depend on how this data is used.

   Privacy for location data is typically important.  Adding relative
   location may increase the precision of the location, but does not

   otherwise alter its privacy considerations, which are discussed in
   [RFC4119]

   The fractional bits in IEEE 754 [IEEE.754] floating point values can
   be used as a covert channel.  For values of either zero or infinity,
   non-zero fraction bits could be used to convey information.  If the
   presence of covert channels is not desired then the fractional bits
   MUST be set to zero.  There is no need to represent NaN (not a
   number) in this encoding.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Relative Location Registry

   This document creates a new registry called "Relative Location
   Parameters".  As defined in [RFC5226], this registry operates under
   "IETF Review" rules.

   The content of this registry includes:

   Relative Location Code: Numeric identifier, assigned by IANA.

   Brief description: Short description identifying the meaning of the
   element.

   Reference to published specification: A stable reference to an RFC
   which describes the value in sufficient detail so that
   interoperability between independent implementations is possible.

   Values requested to be assigned into this registry MUST NOT conflict
   with values assigned in the CAtypes registry or vice versa, unless
   the IANA considerations section for the new value explicitly
   overrides this prohibition and the document defining the value
   describes how conflicting TLV codes will be interpreted by
   implementations.

   The values defined are:

   +--------+----------------------------------------+-----------+

    <abstract>
	  <t>
Some applications that associate state information with public key certificates
can benefit from a way to link together a set of certificates belonging to the
same end entity that can safely be considered to be equivalent for the purposes
of referencing that application state information.  This memo defines a
certificate extension that allows applications to
establish the required linkage without introducing a new application protocol data unit.
	</t> </abstract> </front>

    <section title="Introduction">

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC5280">RFC 5280</xref> defines a profile for the use of
public key certificates for Internet applications. If an application associates
application state information with a public key certificate, then that
association may be disrupted if the end entity changes its public key
certificate. Such disruption can occur due to renewals or if the end entity
changes its certificate issuer. Similarly, if the end entity is actually a
distributed system, where each instance has a different private key, then the
relying party (RP) has no way to associate the different public key certificates
with the relevant application state information.  </t>

<t>For example, assume a web browser retains state information (perhaps
passwords) about a web site, indexed (possibly indirectly) via values contained
in the web server's public key certificate (perhaps a DNS name). When the web
server certificate expires, and a new certificate is acquired (perhaps with a
different DNS name), then the browser cannot safely map the new certificate to
the relevant state information.</t>

<t>This memo defines a new public key certificate extension that supports such
linkage, allowing the certificate issuer to attest that the end entity that
holds the private key for the certificate in question also holds other private
keys corresponding to other identified certificates.</t>

<t>Other than the issuer asserting that the set of certificates belong to the
same end entity for use with the same application, the fine-detail of the
semantics of the linkage of certificates is not defined here, since that is a
matter for application developers and the operators of certification
authorities (CAs). In particular we do not define how a CA can validate that
the same end entity is the holder of the various private keys, nor how the
application should make use of this information. Nor do we define what kinds of
state information may be shared.</t>

    </section>

	<section anchor="usecases" title="A Use Case">

			<t>Public key certificates expire, typically about a year after
they are created. Some applications might need to know that the same entity is
the subject of this certificate and a previously used certificate. </t>

<t>For example, if a web server certificate expires, it could be useful for a
web browser to know that the server currently presenting a certificate in a
<xref target="RFC5246">TLS</xref> handshake represents the same web server that
previously presented a certificate. This could be used for example to allow the
browser to automatically fill in form fields for the server in question, even
if the server certificate has been replaced. While the same effect can be
achieved based on the use of the same issuer and subject fields in a certificate
there could be security issues involved in such comparisons, e.g. if the
subject name includes a DNS name and the ownership of that DNS domain has
changed.</t>

<t>The use of the new extension provides a way for the CA to signal
to the application that the same end entity is involved, regardless of name
changes. The new extension could also allow the web site operator to
more easily change CA when replacing its certificate.</t>

	</section>

	<section anchor="extension" title="Other Certificates Extension">

	<t>This section defines the syntax for the other certificates extension.</t>

	<t>The new extension is simply a list of references to the
linked certificates. The references make use of the 
SCVPCertID structure from the <xref target="RFC5055">SCVP</xref>
protocol which contains a hash over the relevant certificate
and the certificate's issuer and serial number.</t>


	<t>When this extension is present the CA is asserting that the 
same end entity is the subject of the relevant certificates. </t>

	<t>This extension MUST NOT be marked critical.</t>

	<t>id-pe-otherCerts OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pe 19 }</t>

	<t>OtherCertificates ::= SEQUENCE OF SCVPCertID</t>

<t>CAs MUST only issue certificates containing this extension where the links
created are such that the relevant consumers of the certificates can safely
make use of those links. This will typically be the case where the certificates
are only used by a single application.  CAs MUST NOT issue certificates that
link to certificates issued for a different purpose, for example, a CA SHOULD
NOT link a web server certificate to a VPN gateway certificate (unless those
can be the same, which might occur for some embedded devices). The purpose
for which the certificate is intended may be determined by certificate policy 
or other means (e.g. extended key usage object identifiers) that are out
of scope of this specification.</t>

<t>CAs MUST NOT issue certificates containing this extension unless they have
validated that the end entity is the holder of all of the relevant private
keys.</t>

<t>Applications MUST validate certificates according to the rules specified in
<xref target="RFC5280">RFC 5280</xref>, and MUST NOT assume that because
certificates are linked, that they are therefore valid. This means of course
that both certificates must chain up to some local trust point(s).</t>

<t>If an application imposes further checks on certificate validity (e.g. as is
done in <xref target="RFC2818">RFC 2818</xref> for web server certificates),
then both certificates MUST be valid according to those application specific
rules.</t>

<t>It is not required that two linked certificates are both simultaneously
valid. For example, an application can validate certificate1 and cache that
information.  When the application is subsequently presented with certificate2
(linked back to certificate1), if it considers the cached information about
certificate1 trustworthy, then it can validate certificate2, and use the
linkage to associate certificate2 with the relevant application state
information. (Just as it would have done had certificate1 been re-presented.)
As a second example, if certificate1 has expired, but would otherwise be valid,
then the linkage from certificate2 can also be used once certificate2 has been
validated.</t>

<t>If the application checks certificate status for the certificates in
question, and any of the certificates concerned has been revoked, then the
linkage MUST NOT be used.</t>

<t>Note that there are no constraints on the contents of the certificate
to which the link points. The consequence is that the CA issuing the
new certificate can link back to legacy certificates of all kinds, once
the relevant RP supports this extension.</t>

<t>This extension MUST only be used in end-entity certificates, that is, it
MUST NOT be used in CA certificates or other similar certificates. Since
CA certificates are only used for certificate validation and this extension
has no effect on the validation procedure, this extension would generally be 
meaningless in a CA certificate. In addition, it may be wise to gain some
deployment experience with this extension before using it for more 
security sensitive certificates like CA certificates.</t>

	</section>

<section anchor="PI" title="Another Approach using Permanent Identifiers">

<t><xref target="RFC4043">RFC 4043</xref> defines a new name form (a "Permanent
Identifier" or PI) for public key certificates that supports
similar functionality to the new extension defined here. If two certificates
have the same PI and that PI form is globally unique, then the end-entities
involved can be considered to be the same.</t>

<t>The main difference between the PI and the other certificates extension is
that, (when more than one CA is involved), PI requires a globally unique
identifier, whereas the other certificates extension only requires that the
issuer of the new certificate be able to link back to the old
certificate(s).</t>

<t>As a consequence the other certificates extension can be deployed
"reactively" to link certificates that may not match "ideal" application naming
requirements. If the old certificate did make use of PI, then presumably
application naming issues have already been handled, and then the new
certificate can contain the same PI. In this latter case there would be no need
for the other certificates extension.</t> 

</section>

<section anchor="Optimise" title="A Possible Optimisation">

<t>The SCVPCertID structure used here contains the issuer name for the CA of
the linked certificate. It may happen that this issuer is also the issuer of
the certificate containing the other-certificates extension. If a new
certificate were linked back to a number of old certificates from that same CA,
then there would be considerable redundancy since there would be many copies of
the same issuer name. </t>

<t>One suggestion raised was to have a convention where if the X.500 Name in
the SCVPCertID is an "empty" DN (see RFC5280) that that would indicate that the
same CA issued both the current and the linked certificates. However, that
scheme is not adopted in this version. A future, standards-track version of
this specification might adopt that optimisation.</t>

      <t>This memo includes no request to IANA.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">

	<t>As stated above, relying parties MUST validate any certificates per the
	algorithm given in <xref target="RFC5280"> RFC 5280</xref> before making
	any use of those certificates.</t>

	<t>Relying parties similarly MUST NOT assume that any other fields in the
	relevant certificates have common values. For example, linked certificates
	might have non-overlapping key usage extensions.</t>

	<t>Since the issuer of the new certificate (or some superior CA) is trusted
	by the RP, and the RP has validated the new certificate, the RP is
	basically as reliant on the proper operation of that CA as always - if the
	CA wished to "cheat" on the RP the other certificates extension simply
	provides a new way to do that, but one that is equivalent to existing
	vulnerabilities. In many cases such a bad CA could simply issue a new
	certificate that is identical in all respects (other than the key pair) and
	the RP would accept the identity contained in that new certificate.</t>

	<t>However, if the issuer of the new certificate is limited in some way
	(e.g. via a name constraint in a superior CA certificate), and if the old
	certificate doesn't match those limitations (e.g. the subject of the old
	certificate doesn't fit under the name constraints of the issuer of the 
	new certificate), then the new certificate could be linked back to 
	an identity that doesn't meet the constraints intended to be imposed
	on the issuer of the new certificate. Applications for which this is
	an unacceptable risk SHOULD NOT make use of the other certificates
	extension.</t>

	<t>Since the SCVPCertID structure includes a hash of the other
	certificate and hash algorithm weaknesses that produce collisions are
	becomming more of an issue, CAs and relying parties MUST ensure that
	currently acceptable hash functions are used. In particular the default
	use of SHA-1 for SCVPCertID may or may not currently be considered
	acceptable. CAs might be wise to use SHA-256 instead, but will
	typically use whatever hash function they use as part of certificate
	signing..</t>

      <section title="Replace Section 6.3. Linking Identity and POP Information">
        <t>Replace the text of the section with the following text.</t>

        <t>
          In a Full PKI Request, identity proof information about the client is
          carried in the certificate associated with signature of the SignedData containing the
          certification requests, one of the two identity proof controls or the MAC computed for the AuthenticatedData containing the certification reqeusts.
          Proof-of-possession information for key
          pairs, however, is carried separately for each PKCS #10 or CRMF
          certification request.  (For keys capable of generating a digital
          signature, the POP is provided by the signature on the PKCS #10 or
          CRMF request.  For encryption-only keys, the controls described in
          Section 6.7 are used.)  In order to prevent substitution-style
          attacks, the protocol must guarantee that the same entity supplied
          both the POP and proof-of-identity information.
        </t>

        <t>
          We describe three mechanisms for linking identity and POP
          information: witness values cryptographically derived from a
          shared-secret (Section 6.3.1), shared-secret/subject
          name matching (Section 6.3.2), and subject name matching to an existing
          certificate (Section 6.3.3).  Clients and servers MUST support the witness
          value and the certificate linking techniques.  
          Clients and servers MAY support shared-secret/name matching or 
          MAY support other bilateral techniques of similar
          strength.  The idea behind the first two mechanisms is to force the
          client to sign some data into each certification request that can be
          directly associated with the shared-secret; this will defeat attempts
          to include certification requests from different entities in a single
          Full PKI Request.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Replace Section 6.3.3.  Renewal and Rekey Messages">

        <t>
          New section title is "Existing Certificate Linking".  Replace all text in this section with this text.
        </t>

        <t>
          Linking between the POP and an identity is easy when an existing
          certificate is used.  The client copies all of the naming information
          from the existing certificate (subject name and subject alternative name)
          into the new certification request.  The POP on the new public key is
          then performed by using the new key to sign the identity information (linking the POP to a specific identity).
          The identity information is then tied to the POP information by signing the entire enrollment request with the public key of the existing certificate.
        </t>

        <t>
          Existing certificate linking can be used in the following
          circumstances:
          <list style="empty">
            <t>When replacing a certificate by doing a renewal or rekey
              certification request.</t>
            <t>Using of an existing certificate to get a new certificate.  An
      example of this would be to get a key establishment certificate
      after having gotten a signature certificate.</t>
            <t>Using a third party certificate to get a new certificate from a
      CA.  An example of this would be to use a certificate and key pair
      distributed with a device to prove an identity.  This requires
      that the CA have an out-of-band channel to map the identity in the device certificate
      to the new EE identity.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="New Section 6.20 RA Identity Proof Witness control">
        <t>
          The RA Identity Proof Witness control allows an RA to indicate to
          subsequence control processors that all of the identity proof
          requirements have been met.  This permits the identity proof to be
          performed at a location closer to the end-entity.  For example, the
          identity proof could be done at a physical location while the CA could
          be companywide (and thus span multiple physical locations). 
          The RA performs the identity proof, and
          potentially other tasks that require the secret to be used, while the
          CA would be prevented from knowing the secret.  If the
          identity proof fails, then the RA returns an error to the client
          denoting that fact.
        </t>

        <t>
          The relevant ASN.1 for the RA Identity Proof Witness control is as
          follows:
        </t>

<figure><artwork>
   cmc-raIdentityWitness CMC-CONTROL ::=
      { BodyPartPath IDENTIFIED BY id-cmc-raIdentityWitness }

   id-cmc-raIdentityWitness OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-cmc TBD}
</artwork></figure>

        <t>
          The above ASN.1 defines the following items:

          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="cmc-raIdentityWitness"> is a CMC-CONTROL associating the object identifier id-cmc-raIdentityWitness and the type BodyPartPath.  This object is omitted from the 1988 module. The object is added to the object set Cmc-Control-Set .  The control is only permitted to occur in the control
          sequence of a PKIData object.  It is not permitted to occur in the
          control sequence of a PKIRespones.  The control is only permitted to
          be used by an RA.  The control may occur multiple times in a control
          sequence each occurrence pointing to a different object.
            </t>

            <t hangText="id-cmc-rsIdentitiyWitness"> is the object identifier used to identify this CMC control.
            </t>

            <t hangText="BodyPartPath"> is the type structure associated with the control.  The syntax of BodyPartPath is defined in Section 3.2.2.  The path contains a sequence of body part identifiers leading to one of the following items:
              <list style="hanging">
                <t hangText="Identity Proof control">  if the RA verified the identity proof in this
                  control.</t>
                <t hangText="Identity Proof Version 2">  if the RA verified the identity proof in
                  this control.</t>
                <t hangText="Full PKI Request">  if the RA performed an out-of-band identity proof
                  for this request.  The request SHOULD NOT contain either Identity
                  Proof control.</t>
                <t hangText="Simple PKI Request">  if the RA performed an out-of-band identity proof
                  for this request.</t>
              </list>
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          The RA Identity Proof Witness control will frequently be associated
          with a Modify Certification Request control which changes the name
          fields in the associated certification requests as the RA will
          frequently know the actual name to be assigned to the entity
          requesting the certificate and the entity will not know the actual
          details of the name.  (The association would be setup by the operator
          at the time the shared secret was generated by the RA.)
        </t>

        <t>
          When this control is placed in a message, it is RECOMMENDED that the
          Control Processed Control be placed in the body sequence as well.
          Using the explicit new control, rather than implicitly relying on the
          Control Processed control is important due to the need to explicitly
          know which identity proofs have been perform.  The new control also allows
          an RA to state that out-of-band idenitity proofs have been performed.
        </t>

	<t>
	  When the identity proof is performed by an RA, the RA also needs to validate the linking between the identity proof and the name information wrapped inside of the key proof-of-possession.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title="New Section 6.21 Response Body Control">
        <t>This item is to be added to the table in section 6.</t>

        <t>The Response Body Control is designed for an RA to inform an EE that there is an embedded response message that needs to be processed as part of the processing of this message.  This control is designed to be used in a couple of different cases where an RA has done some additional processing on the certificate request such as key generation and needs to respond with both the original response message from the certificate issues as well as the response the RA is generating.  Another case this is useful is the shared secret is between the RA and the EE and the RA needs to return a Publish Trust Anchors control in order to populate the correct trust points.</t>

        <t>The relaveant ASN.1 for the Response Body Control is as follows:</t>

        <figure><artwork>
  cmc-responseBody CMC-CONTROL ::= {
     BodyPartPath IDENTIFIED BY id-cmc-responseBody
  }

  id-cmc-responseBody OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-cmc TBD}
</artwork></figure>

        <t>The above ASN.1 defines the following items:
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="cmc-responseBody"> is a CMC-CONTROL associating the object identifier id-cmc-responseBody with the type BodyPartPath.  This object is omitted from the 1988 module.  The object is added to the object set Cmc-Control-Set.  The control is only permitted to occur in the control sequence of a PKIResponse.  The control is not permitted to occur in the control sequence of a PKIData.  It is only expected that an intermediary RA will use this control, a CA generally does not need the control as it is creating the original innermost message.</t>
            <t hangText="id-cmc-responseBody"> is the object identifier used to identify this CMC control.</t>
            <t hangText="BodyPartPath"> is the type structure associated with the control.  The syntax of BodyPartPath is defined in Section 3.2.2.  The path contains a sequence of body part identifiers leading to a cmsSequence item which contains a PKIResponse within it.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="New Section 7. Other Attributes">
        <t>This section is to be inserted before the current section 7.</t>

        <t>There are a number of different locations that various types of attributes can be placed in either a CMC request or a CMC response message.  These places include the attribute sequence of a PKCS #10 request, registrcation controls in CRMF and the various CMS attribute sequences.</t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="New Section 7.1 Change Subject Name Attribute">
        <t>
          The Client Name Change Request Attribute is designed for a client to
          ask for a change in its name as part of a certificate request.  This cannot
          be done in the simple way of just changing the requested subject name
          in the certificate template because of security issues.  The name in
          the certificate request needs to match the name in the certificate
          used to sign the request in order that identity and possession proofs
          are correctly applied.
        </t>

        <t>
          The relevant ASN.1 for the Client Name Change Request attribute is as
          follows:
        </t>

        <figure><artwork>
   at-cmc-changeSubjectName ATTRIBUTE ::=
      { ChangeSubjectName IDENTIFIED BY id-cmc-changeSubjectName }

   id-cmc-changeSubjectName OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-cmc TBD}

   ChangeSubjectName ::= SEQUENCE {
       subject             Name OPTIONAL,
       subjectAlt          SubjectAltName OPTIONAL
   }
   (WITH COMPONENTS {..., subject PRESENT} |
         COMPONENTS {..., subjectAltPRESENT} )
        </artwork></figure>

        <t>
          The attribute is designed to be used as an ATTRIBUTE object.  As such
          the attribute is placed in one of the following two places:
          <list>
            <t>The attributes field in a CertificationRequest.</t>
            <t>The controls field of a CertRequest for a CRMF certification
              request.</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          The control is identified by the Object Identifier id-cmc-changedSubjectName.
        </t>

        <t>
          The ASN.1 type associated with control is ChangeSubjectName.  The
          fields of the structure are configured as follows:
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="subject"> contains the requested subject name for the new certificate.</t>

            <t hangText="subjectAlt">  contains the requested subject alternative name for the
              new certificate.</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          At least one of the fields in the sequence MUST be present when
          encoding the structure.
        </t>

        <t>
          When the CA processes this attribute in a certification request it
          will do the following:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>The subject field is copied to the name field of the template if
              present.  If the subject field is absent, the name field of the
              template will be set to a empty sequence.</t>
            <t>The subjectAlt field is used as the content of a SubjectAltName
              extension in the certificate if present.  The subjectAltName
              extension is removed from the certificate template if the
              subjectAlt field is absent.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="New Section 9. Certificate Requirements">
        <t>
          This section is to be inserted before the current section 8.
        </t>

        <t>
          Certificates for servers used in the CMC protocol SHOULD conform with
          the profile defined in <xref target="RFC5280"/>.  This document defines some
          additional items that can appear in CMC server certificates.  Section
          8.1 defines some additional Extended Key Usage values that can appear
          in certificates.  Section 8.2 defines a new Subject Information
          Access value which allows for a CMC certificate to publish
          information on how to contact the services it provides.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="New Section 9.1. Extended Key Usage">

        <t>
          The Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension is used to restrict the use of
          a certificate to specific applications.  We define three different
          EKUs in this document.  The ASN.1 to define these EKUs is:
        </t>

        <figure><artwork>
   id-kp-cmcCA OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp TBD }
   id-kp-cmcRA OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp TBD }
   id-kp-cmcArchive OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp TBD }
        </artwork></figure>

        <t>
          The usage description for each of the EKUs is as follows:
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="CMC Certification Authorities">  are identified by the id-kp-cmcCA
      extended key usage.  The certificate may be the same as the CA
      certificate or may be different than the CA certificate.  If a
      different certificate is used, the certificates containing the id-kp-cmcCA extended key usage SHOULD have the same name as
      the certificate used for issuing the certificates.  (Using a
      separate public key for CMC protocol operations and for issuing
      Certificates and CRLs decreases the number of operations for which
      the private key would be used.)</t>

            <t hangText="CMC Registration Authorities">  are identified by the id-kp-cmcRA
      extended key usage.  This usage is placed into RA certificates.</t>
            <t hangText="CMC Archive Servers">  are identified by the id-kp-cmcArchive extended
      key usage.  CMC Archive Servers and the associated protocol are to
      be defined in a future document.</t>

        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="New Section 9.2. Subject Information Access">

        <t>
   The subject information access extension indicates how to access the
   information and services for the subject of the certificate.  We
   define a new value to go into this extension to identify the
   different locations that CMC services will be available.  If this
   value is placed in a certificate, an appropriate extended key usage
   defined in section 8.1 MUST be included in the certificate as well.
   </t>

        <t>
   The id-ad-cmc OID is used when the subject offers certification
   services using the CMC Protocol.  Where the CMC services are
   available via HTTP or FTP, accessLocation MUST be a
   uniformResourceIdentifier.  Where the CMC services are available via
   electronic mail, accessLocation MUST be an rfc822Name.  Where CMC
   services are available using TCP/IP, the dNSName or iPAddress name
   forms MUST be used. Since the GeneralName data structure does not permit the inclusion of a port number, in the absence of other external configuration information the value of TBD1 should be used.
  The semantics of other name forms of
   accessLocation (when accessMethod is id-ad-cmc) are not defined by
   this specification.
   </t>

          The ASN.1 for this extension is:  GeneralName

   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
   capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
   interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
   should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

<list>
<t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119.

<t>This document defines the base syntax for CMC, a Certificate Management protocol using the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS). This protocol addresses two immediate needs within the Internet Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) community:&lt;/t>&lt;t> 1. The need for an interface to public key certification products and services based on CMS and PKCS #10 (Public Key Cryptography Standard), and&lt;/t>&lt;t> 2. The need for a PKI enrollment protocol for encryption only keys due to algorithm or hardware design.&lt;/t>&lt;t> CMC also requires the use of the transport document and the requirements usage document along with this document for a full definition.

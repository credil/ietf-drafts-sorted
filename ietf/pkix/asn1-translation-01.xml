      <t>
        Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is widely used throughout the IETF security area and has been for many years.  Some specifications were written using a now deprecated version of ASN.1 and some were written using the current version of ASN.1.  Not all ASN.1 compilers support both older and current syntax.  This document is intended to provide guidance to specification authors and to implementers converting ASN.1 modules written using one version of ASN.1 to another version without causing changes to the "bits on the wire".  This document does not provide a comprehensive tutorial of any version of ASN.1.  Instead, it addresses ASN.1 features that are used in IETF security area specifications with focus on items that vary with the ASN.1 version.  
      </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>
  <middle>
  <section title="Introduction">
        <t>
          This document is intended to serve as a tutorial for converting ASN.1 modules written using <xref target="CCITT.X208.1988"/> to <xref target="CCITT.X680.2002"/>, or vice versa.  Preparation of this document was motivated by <xref target="I-D.ietf-pkix-new-asn1"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-smime-new-asn1"/>, which provide updated ASN.1 modules for a number of RFCs.
        </t>
    <t>The intent of this specification is to assist with translation of ASN.1 from one version to another without resulting in any changes to the encoded results when using the Basic Encoding Rules or Distinguished Encoding Rules <xref target="CCITT.X209.1988"/><xref target="CCITT.X690.2002"/>.  Other encoding rules were not considered.</t>
    <t>
      Transforming a new ASN.1 module to an older ASN.1 module can be performed in a fairly mechanical manner, much of the transformation consists of deleting new constructs.  Transforming an older ASN.1 module to a newer ASN.1 module can also be done fairly mechanically, if one does not wish to move many of the constraints that are contained in the prose into the ASN.1 module.  If the constraints are to be added, then the conversion can be a complex process.
    </t>
        <section title="Terminology">
          <t>This document addresses two different versions of ASN.1. The old (1988) version was defined in a single document (X.208) and the newer (1998, 2002) version is defined in a series of documents (X.680, X.681, X.682 and X.683).  For convenience, the series of documents is henceforth referred to as X.68x.  Specific documents from the series are referenced by name where appropriate.</t>
          <t>
            The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
            "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
            document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
          </t>
        </section>
      </section>
  <section title="ASN.1 design elements">
        <t>
          When translating an ASN.1 module from X.208 syntax to X.68x syntax, or vice versa, many definitions do not require or benefit from change.  Review of the original ASN.1 modules updated by <xref target="I-D.ietf-pkix-new-asn1"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-smime-new-asn1"/> and the revised modules included in those documents indicates that most changes can be sorted into one of a few categories.  This section describes these categories.
        </t>
      <section title="Open types">
        <t>Protocols often feature flexible designs that enable other (later) specifications to define the syntax and semantics of some features.  For example, <xref target="RFC5280"/> includes the definition of the Extension structure.  There are many instances of extensions defined in other specifications.  Several mechanisms are available in X.208, X.68x or both to accommodate this practice, as described below.</t>
        <section title="ANY DEFINED BY">
          <t>
            X.208 defines the ANY DEFINED BY production for specifying open types.  This typically appears in a SEQUENCE along with an OBJECT IDENTIFIER that indicates the type of object that is encoded.  The ContentInfo structure, shown below from <xref target="RFC3852"/>, uses ANY DEFINED BY along with an OBJECT IDENTIFIER field to identify and convey arbitrary types of data.  Each content type to be wrapped in a ContentInfo is assigned a unique OBJECT IDENTIFIER, such as the id-signedData shown below.  However, X.208 does not provide a formal means for establishing a relationship between a type and the type identifier.  Any associations are done in the comments of the module and/or the text of the associated document.

        <section title="OCTET STRINGs and BIT STRINGs">
          <t>
            Both X.208 and X.68x allow open types to be implemented using OCTET STRINGs and BIT STRINGs as containers.  The definitions of Extension and SubjectPublicKeyInfo in <xref target="RFC5280"/> demonstrate the usage of OCTET STRING and BIT STRING, respectively, to convey information that is further defined using ASN.1.
          </t>
          <figure>

          <section title="Information Object Classes">
            <t>
              Information object classes are defined in <xref target="CCITT.X681.2002"/>.  Object classes allow protocol designers to relate pieces of data that are in some way associated.  In the most generic of terms, an Information Object class can be thought of as a database schema, with Information Object Sets being instances of the databases.
            </t>

          <t>Unlike type definitions, object classes with the same structure are not equivalent.  Thus if you have:</t>

          <t>
          <list>
            <t>FOO ::= TYPE-IDENTIFIER</t>
            <t>BAR ::= TYPE-IDENTIFIER</t>
          </list>
          </t>

          <t>FOO and BAR are not interchangeable.</t>

          <t>TYPE-IDENTIFIER is one of the predefined information object classes in Annex A of <xref target="CCITT.X681.2002"/>.  This provides for a simple mapping from an OBJECT IDENTIFIER to a data type.  The tag UNIQUE on &amp;id means that this value may appear only once in an Information Object Set, however multiple objects can be defined with the same &amp;id value.
        </t>

          <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-smime-new-asn1"/> uses the TYPE-IDENTIFIER construction to update the definition of ContentInfo, as shown below.</t>

            This example illustrates the following:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Definition of an information object class: TYPE-IDENITIFIER and CONTENT-TYPE are information object classes.</t>
              <t>Definition of an information object, or an instance of an information object class: ct-SignedData is an information object.</t>
              <t>Definition of an information object set: ContentSet is an information object set.</t>
              <t>Usage of an information object: The definition of ContentInfo uses information from the CONTENT-TYPE information object class.</t>

            </list>
            </t>
            <t>As noted above, TYPE-IDENTIFIER simply associates an OBJECT IDENTIFIER with an arbitrary data type.  CONTENT-TYPE is a TYPE-IDENTIFIER.  The WITH SYNTAX component allows for a more natural language expression of information object definitions.</t>
            <t>ct-SignedData is the name of an information object that associated the identifier id-signedData with the data type SignedData.  It is an instance of the CONTENT-TYPE information object class.  The &amp;Type field is assigned the value SignedData and the &amp;id field is assigned the value id-signedData.  The example above uses the syntax provided by the WITH SYNTAX component of the TYPE-IDENTIFIER definition.  An equivalent definition not using the provided syntax is as follows: </t>

            <t>ContentSet is the name of a set of information objects derived from the CONTENT-TYPE information object class.  The set contains six information objects and is extensible, as indicated by the ellipsis (see the Versioning and Extensibility section below).</t>
            <t>ContentInfo is defined using type information from an information object, i.e., the type of the contentType field is that of the &amp;id field from CONTENT-TYPE.  An equivalent definition is as follows:</t>

            <t>Both fields in ContentInfo are constrained.  The contentType field is constrained using a simple table constraint that restricts the values to those from the corresponding field of the objects in ContentSet.  The content field is constrained using a component relationship constraint.  Constraints are discussed in the next section.</t>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section title="Constraints">
			<t>The X.68x versions of the ASN.1 specifications introduced the ability to use the object information sets as part of the constraint on the values that a field can take.   Simple table constraints are used to restrict the set of values that can occur in a field.  Component relation constraints allow for the restriction of a field based on contents of other fields in the type.</t>
          <section title="Simple table constraints">
            <t>
              Simple table constraints are widely used in <xref target="I-D.ietf-pkix-new-asn1"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-smime-new-asn1"/> to limit implementer options (although the constraints are almost always followed by or include extensibility markers making the parameters serve an informational purpose not as a limitation).  Table constraints are defined in <xref target="CCITT.X682.2002"/>.
            </t>
            <t>Some ASN.1 compilers have the ability to use the simple table constraint to check that a field contains one of the legal values.</t>
            <t>
              The following example from <xref target="I-D.ietf-smime-new-asn1"/> provides two examples of using table constraints to clarify the intended usage of a particular field.  The parameters indicate the types of attributes that are typically found in the signedAttrs and unsignedAttrs fields.  In this example, the object sets are disjoint but this is not required.  For example, in <xref target="I-D.ietf-pkix-new-asn1"/>, there is some overlap between the CertExtensions and CrlExtensions sets.

              Component relation constraints are often used to bind the type field of an open type to the identifier field.  Using the binding in this way allows for a compiler to immediately decode the associated type when the containing structure is defined.  The following example from <xref target="RFC2560"/> as updated <xref target="I-D.ietf-pkix-new-asn1"/> demonstrates this usage.

In this example, the response field is constrained to contain a type identified by the responseType field.  The controlling field is identified using atNotation, e.g., "@responseType".  atNotation can be defined relative to the outermost SEQUENCE, SET or CHOICE or relative to the field with which the atNotation is associated.  When there is no '.' immediately after the '@', the field appears as a member of the outermost SEQUENCE, SET or CHOICE.  When there is a '.' immediately after the '@', each '.' represents a SEQUENCE, SET or CHOICE starting with the SEQUENCE, SET or CHOICE that contains the field with which the atNotation is associated.  For example, ResponseBytes could have been written as shown below.  In this case, the syntax is very similar since the innermost and outermost SEQUENCE, SET or CHOICE are the same.</t>

            <t>
              Open types implemented as OCTET STRINGs or BIT STRINGs can be constrained using contents constraints syntax defined in <xref target="CCITT.X682.2002"/>.  Below are the revised definitions from <xref target="I-D.ietf-pkix-new-asn1"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-smime-new-asn1"/>.  These show usage of OCTET STRING and BIT STRING along with constrained sets of identifiers.  The Extension definition uses a content constraint that requires the value of the OCTET STRING to be an encoding the type associated with the information object selected from the ExtensionSet object set using the value of the extnID field.  For reasons described above in the "Component relation constraints" section, the SubjectPublicKeyInfo definition relies on prose to bind the BIT STRING to the type identifier because it is not possible to express a content constraint that includes a component relationship constraint to bind the type value within the algorithm field to the subjectPublicKey field.

          Parameterization is defined in <xref target="CCITT.X683.2002"/> and can also be used to define new types in a way similar to the macro notation described in Annex A of X.208.  The following example from <xref target="I-D.ietf-pkix-new-asn1"/> shows this usage.  The toBeSigned field takes the type passed as a parameter.

        <t>Parameters need not be simple types.  The following example demonstrates the usage of an information object class and an information object set as parameters.  The first parameter in the definition of AlgorithmIdentifier is an information object class.  Information object classes used for this parameter must have &amp;id and &amp;Params fields, which determine the type of the algorithm and parameters fields.  Other fields may be present in the information object class but they are not used by the definition of AlgorithmIdentifier, as demonstrated by the SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM class shown below.  The second parameter is an information object set that is used to constrain the values that appear in the algorithm and parameters fields.</t>

      <section title="Versioning and Extensibility">
        <t>Specifications are often revised and ASN.1 modules updated to include new components.  <xref target="CCITT.X681.2002"/> provides two mechanisms useful in supporting extensibility: extension markers and version brackets.  
        </t>
        <section title="Extension markers">
          <t>An extension marker is represented by an ellipsis (i.e., three adjacent periods).  Extension markers are included in specifications at points where the protocol designer anticipates future changes.  This can also be achieved by including EXTENSIBILITY IMPLIED in the ASN.1 module definition.  EXTENSIBILITY IMPLIED is the equivalent to including an extension marker in each type defined in the ASN.1 module.  Extensibility markers are used throughout <xref target="I-D.ietf-pkix-new-asn1"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-smime-new-asn1"/> where object sets are defined.  In other instances, the updated modules retroactively added extension markers where fields were added to an earlier version by an update, as shown in the CertificateChoices example below.</t>

            <t><list>
<t>A to Z</t>
<t>a to z</t>
<t>0 to 9</t>

      <section title="Downgrading from X.68x to X.208">
        <t>At a minimum, downgrading an ASN.1 module from X.68x syntax to X.208 requires the removal of features not supported by X.208.  As indicated above, the features most commonly used in IETF security area ASN.1 modules are information object classes (and object sets), content constraints, parameterization, version brackets and extension markers.  Extension markers and version brackets can simply be deleted (or commented out).  The definitions for information object classes and object sets can also be deleted or commented out, as these will not be used.  The following checklist can be used in most cases:</t>
        <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Remove all Information Set Class, Information Set Object and Information Set Object Set definitions and imports from the file.</t>
          <t>Replace all fixed Type Information Set Class element references with the fixed type.  (I.e. Replace FOO.&amp;id with OBJECT IDENTIFIER.)</t>
          <t>Delete all simple constraints.</t>
          <t>Delete all CONTAINING statements.</t>
          <t>Replace all variable Type Information Set Class element references with either ANY or ANY DEFINED BY statements.</t>
          <t>Remove version and extension markers.</t>

      </section>
      <section title="Upgrading from X.208 to X.68x">
        <t>The amount of change associated with upgrading from X.208 syntax to X.68x syntax is dependent on the reasons for changing and personal style.  A minimalist approach could consist of altering any deprecated features, most commonly ANY DEFINED BY, and adding any necessary extensibility markers.  A more comprehensive approach may include of the introduction of constraints, parameterization, versioning, extensibility, etc.</t>
        <t>The following checklist can be used when upgrading a module without introducing constraints:</t>
        <t><list>
          <t>Use TYPE-IDENTIFIER.&amp;Type for "ANY".</t>
          <t>Use TYPE-IDENTIFIER.&amp;Type for "ANY DEFINED BY ...".</t>
        </list>
        </t>
        <t>When constraints are introducing during an upgrade, additional steps are necessary:</t>
        <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Identify each unique class that should be defined based on what types of things exist.</t>
          <t>Define an Information Object Class for each of the classes above with the appropriate elements.</t>
          <t>Define the all of appropriate Information Object Sets based on the classes defined in step 2 along with the different places that they should be used.</t>
          <t>Replace ANY by the appropriate class and variable type element.</t>
          <t>Replace ANY DEFINED BY with the appropriate variable type element and the components constraint.  Replace the element used in the constraint with the appropriate fixed type element and simple constraint.</t>
          <t>Add any simple constraints as appropriate.</t>
          <t>Define any objects and fill in elements for object sets as appropriate.</t>

      <section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
Where a module is downgraded from X.68x syntax to X.208 there is loss of potential automated enforcement of constraints expressed by the author of the module being downgraded.  These constraints should be captured in prose or ASN.1 comments and enforced through other means, as necessary.
</t>
<t>Depending on the feature set of the ASN.1 compiler being used, the code to enforce and use constraints may be generated automatically or may require the programmer to do this independently.  It is the responsibility of the programmer to ensure that the constraints on the ASN.1 expressed either in prose or in the ASN.1 module are actually enforced.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS Resource Record allows a
        DNS domain name holder to specify the Certification Authorities authorized
        to issue certificates for that domain. Publication of CAA resource records
        allow a public Certification Authority (CA) to implement additional
        controls to reduce the risk of unintended certificate mis-issue.
      </t>
      <t>
        Like the TLSA record defined in DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)
        <xref target="DANE"/>, CAA records are used as a part of a mechanism for checking PKIX
        certificate data. The distinction between the two specifications is that
        CAA records specify a authorization control to be performed by a certificate
        issuer before issue of a certificate and TLSA records specify a verification
        control to be performed by a Relying Party after the certificate is issued.
      </t>
      <t>
        Conformance with a published CAA record is a necessary but not sufficient
        condition for issueance of a certificate.
        Before issuing a certificate, a PKIX CA is required to validate the
        request according to the policies set out in its Certificate Policy.
        In the case of a public CA that validates certificate requests
        as a third party, the certificate will be typically issued under
        a public trust anchor certificate embedded in one or more relevant Relying Applications.
      </t>
      <t>
        Criteria for inclusion of embedded trust anchor certificates in applications
        are outside the scope of this document. Typically such criteria require the CA to publish a
        Certificate Practices Statement (CPS) that specifies how the requirements
        of the Certificate Policy (CP) are achieved. It is also common
        for a CA to engage an independent third party auditor to prepare an annual
        audit statement of its performance against its CPS.
      </t>
      <t>
        A set of CAA records describes only current grants of authority to issue
        certificates for the corresponding DNS domain.
        Since a certificate is typically valid
        for at least a year, it is possible that a certificate that is not
        conformant with the CAA records currently published was conformant
        with the CAA records published at the time that the certificate was issued.
        Relying Applications MUST NOT use CAA records as part of certificate
        validation.
      </t>
      <t>
        CAA Records MAY be used by Certificate Evaluators as a possible indicator
        of a security policy violation. Such use SHOULD take account of the
        possibility that published CAA records changed between the time a
        certificate was issued and the time at which the certificate was observed by the
        Certificate Evaluator.

          A CAA RR consists of a flags byte and a tag-value pair referred to as

              certificates for the domain in which the property is published.

            <t hangText="iodef &lt;URL&gt; :">
              Specifies a URL to which an issuer
              MAY report certificate
              issue requests that are inconsistent with the issuer's Certification
              Practices or Certificate Policy, or that a certificate evaluator may
              use to report observation of a possible policy violation. The IODEF
              format is used

        </t>

        <t>
          The following example is a DNS zone file (see <xref target="RFC1035"/>) that
          informs CAs that certificates are not to be issued
          except by the holder of the domain name 'ca.example.net' or an
          authorized agent thereof.
          This policy applies to all subordinate domains under example.com.

        </figure>
        <t>
          If the domain name holder specifies one or more iodef properties, a
          certificate issuer MAY report invalid certificate requests to that address.
          In the following example the domain name holder specifies that reports may
          be made by means of email with the IODEF data as an attachment, a Web
          service <xref target="RFC6546"/> or both:
        </t>

          </artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          A certificate issuer MAY specify additional parameters that allow
          customers to specify additional parameters governing certificate issuance.
          This might be the Certificate Policy under which the certificate is
          to be issued, the authentication process to be used might be specified
          or an account number specified by the CA to enable these parameters to be
          retrieved.
        </t>
        <t>
          For example, the CA 'ca.example.net' has requested its customer 'example.com' to 
          specify the CA's account number '230123' in each of the customer's CAA records.
        </t>

          </artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          The syntax of additional parameters is a sequence of 
          tag-value pairs as defined in section <xref target="ABNF"/>.
          The semantics of such parameters is left to site policy and is
          outside the scope of this document.
        </t>
        <t>
          The critical flag is intended to permit future versions CAA to 
          introduce new semantics that MUST be understood for
          correct processing of the record, preventing conforming CAs
          that do not recognize the new semantics from issuing
          certificates for the indicated domains.
        </t>
        <t>
          In the following example, the property 'tbs' is flagged as
          critical. Neither the example.net CA, nor any other issuer is
          authorized to issue under either policy unless the processing rules for the
          'tbs' property tag are understood.
        </t>

        </figure>
        <t>
          Note that the above restrictions only apply to issue of certificates.
          Since the validity of an end entity certificate is typically a
          year or more, it is quite possible that the CAA records published
          at a domain will change between the time a certificate was issued and
          validation by a relying party.
        </t>

      </section>

    <section title="Certification Authority Processing" anchor="IssuerProcessing">

      <t>
        Before issuing a certificate, a compliant CA MUST check for publication
        of an relevant CAA Resource Record set. If such a record set
        exists, a CA
        MUST NOT issue a certificate unless the CA determines that either
        (1) the certificate request is consistent with the applicable
        CAA Resource
        Record set or (2) that an exception specified in the
        relevant Certificate
        Policy or Certification Practices Statement Applies.
      </t>
      <t>
        A certificate request MAY specify more than one domain name and MAY
        specify wildcard domains. Issuers MUST verify authorization for all
        the domains and wildcard domains specified in the request.
      </t>
      <t>
        Given a request for a specific domain X, or a request for a wildcard 
        domain *.X, the relevant record set R(X) 
        is determined as follows:
      </t>
      <t>
        Let CAA(X) be the record set returned in response to performing a 
        CAA record query on the label X, P(X) be the DNS label immediately
        above X in the DNS hierarchy and A(X) be the target of a CNAME or
        DNAME alias record specified at the label X.
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            If CAA(X) is not empty, R(X) = CAA (X), otherwise
          </t>
          <t>
            If A(X) is not null, and R(A(X)) is not empty, then R(X) = R(A(X)), otherwise
          </t>
          <t>
            If X is not a top level domain then R(X) = R(P(X), otherwise
          </t>
          <t>
            R(X) is empty.
          </t>

        </list>

      </t>
      <t>
        For example, if a certificate is requested for X.Y.Z the issuer will
        search for the relevant CAA record set in the following order:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list>
          <t>
            X.Y.Z

      <section title="Use of DNS Security">
        <t>
          Use of DNSSEC to authenticate CAA RRs is strongly RECOMMENDED but
          not required. An issuer MUST NOT issue certificates if doing so would
          conflict with the relevant CAA Resource Record set,
          irrespective of
          whether the corresponding DNS records are signed.
        </t>
        <t>
          DNSSEC provides a proof of non-existence for both DNS domains and 
          RR set within domains. DNSSEC verification thus enables
          an issuer to determine if the answer to a CAA record query is empty because
          the RR set is empty or if it is non-empty but the response has been
          supressed.
        </t>
        <t>
          Use of DNSSEC allows an issuer to acquire and archive a 
          proof that they were authorized to issue certificates for the domain.
          Verification of such archives MAY be an audit requirement to verify
          CAA record processing compliance. Publication
          of such archives MAY be a transparency requirement to verify
          CAA record processing compliance.

        <t>
          A CAA RR contains a single property entry consisting of a tag value pair.
          Each tag represents
          a property of the CAA record. The value of a CAA property is that
          specified in the corresponding value field.

        <t>
          A domain name MAY have multiple CAA RRs associated with it
          and a given property MAY
          be specified more than once.
        </t>

        <t>
          The CAA data field contains one property entry.

        CAA Records assert a security policy that the holder of a domain name

        records as an access control mechanism is thus dependent on observance of CAA
        constraints by issuers.
      </t>
      <t>
        The objective of the CAA record properties described in this document is
        to reduce the risk of certificate mis-issue rather than avoid reliance on
        a certificate that has ben mis-issued.

        <t>
          CAA records offer CAs a cost-effective means of mitigating the risk
          of certificate mis-issue: The cost of implementing CAA checks is
          very small and the potential costs of a mis-issue event include the
          removal of an embedded trust anchor.

        <t>
          Use of CAA records does not prevent mis-issue

          authorized to issue certificates for the domain in question by CAA records..
        </t>
        <t>
          Domain name holders SHOULD verify that the CAs they authorize to issue
          certificates for their domains employ appropriate controls to ensure
          that certificates are issued only to authorized parties within their
          organization.
        </t>
        <t>
          Such controls are most appropriately determined by the domain name

      <section title="Suppression or spoofing of CAA records">
        <t>
          Suppression of the CAA record or insertion of a bogus CAA record could

          authorized to issue for that domain name.
        </t>

        <t>
          In cases where DNSSEC is not deployed in a corresponding domain, an
          issuer SHOULD attempt to mitigate this risk by employing appropriate
          DNS security controls. For example all portions of the DNS lookup
          process SHOULD be performed against the authoritative name server.
          Data cached by third parties MUST NOT be relied on but MAY be used

          This specific threat is not considered to add significantly to

        <t>
          An attacker could, in principle, perform a Denial of Service attack
          against an issuer by requesting a certificate with a maliciously long
          DNS name. In practice, the DNS protocol imposes a maximum name length
          and CAA processing does not exacerbate the existing need to mitigate
          Denial of Service attacks to any meaningful degree.

          providers.

          In practice, such an attack would be of minimal effect since

          and expert review as set out in <xref target="RFC6195"/>
          Section 3.1.1..
        </t>
        <t>
          The tag space is designed to be sufficiently large that
          exhausting the possible tag space need not be a concern. The scope 
          of expert review SHOULD be limited to the question of whether the
          specification provided is sufficiently clear to permit implementation
          and to avoid unnecessary duplication of functionality.

                  The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS Resource Record allows a DNS domain name holder to specify the certificate signing certificate(s) authorized to issue certificates for that domain. CAA resource records allow a public Certification Authority to implement additional controls to reduce the risk of unintended certificate mis- issue.

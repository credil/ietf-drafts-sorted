      <section title="Replace Section 6.3. Linking Identity and POP Information">
        <t>Replace the text of the section with the following text.</t>

        <t>
          In a CMC Full PKI Request, identity proof information about the client is
          carried in the certificate associated with the signature of the SignedData containing the
          certification requests, one of the two identity proof controls or the MAC computed for the AuthenticatedData containing the certification requests.
          Proof-of-possession information for key
          pairs, however, is carried separately for each PKCS #10 or CRMF
          certification request.  (For keys capable of generating a digital
          signature, the POP is provided by the signature on the PKCS #10 or
          CRMF request.  For encryption-only keys, the controls described in
          Section 6.7 are used.)  In order to prevent substitution-style
          attacks, the protocol must guarantee that the same entity supplied
          both the POP and proof-of-identity information.
        </t>

        <t>
          We describe three mechanisms for linking identity and POP
          information: witness values cryptographically derived from a
          shared-secret (Section 6.3.1), shared-secret/subject
          name matching (Section 6.3.2), and subject name matching to an existing
          certificate (Section 6.3.3).  Clients and servers MUST support the witness
          value and the certificate linking techniques.  
          Clients and servers MAY support shared-secret/name matching or 
          MAY support other bilateral techniques of similar
          strength.  The idea behind the first two mechanisms is to force the
          client to sign some data into each certification request that can be
          directly associated with the shared-secret; this will defeat attempts
          to include certification requests from different entities in a single
          Full PKI Request.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Replace Section 6.3.3.  Renewal and Rekey Messages">

        <t>
          New section title is "Existing Certificate Linking".  Replace all text in this section with this text.
        </t>

        <t>
          Linking between the POP and an identity is easy when an existing
          certificate is used.  The client copies all of the naming information
          from the existing certificate (subject name and subject alternative name)
          into the new certification request.  The POP on the new public key is
          then performed by using the new key to sign the identity information (linking the POP to a specific identity).
          The identity information is then tied to the POP information by signing the entire enrollment request with the private key of the existing certificate.
        </t>

        <t>
          Existing certificate linking can be used in the following
          circumstances:
          <list style="empty">
            <t>When replacing a certificate by doing a renewal or rekey
              certification request.</t>
            <t>Using an existing certificate to get a new certificate.  An
      example of this would be to get a key establishment certificate
      after having gotten a signature certificate.</t>
            <t>Using a third party certificate to get a new certificate from a
      CA.  An example of this would be using a certificate and key pair
      distributed with a device to prove an identity.  This requires
      that the CA have an out-of-band channel to map the identity in the device certificate
      to the new EE identity.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="New Section 6.20 RA Identity Proof Witness control">
        <t>
          The RA Identity Proof Witness control allows an RA to indicate to
          subsequent control processors that all of the identity proof
          requirements have been met.  This permits the identity proof to be
          performed at a location closer to the end-entity.  For example, the
          identity proof could be done at multiple physical locations while the CA could
          operate on a company-wide basis.
          The RA performs the identity proof, and
          potentially other tasks that require the secret to be used, while the
          CA would be prevented from knowing the secret.  If the
          identity proof fails, then the RA returns an error to the client
          denoting that fact.
        </t>

        <t>
          The relevant ASN.1 for the RA Identity Proof Witness control is as
          follows:
        </t>

<figure><artwork>
   cmc-raIdentityWitness CMC-CONTROL ::=
      { BodyPartPath IDENTIFIED BY id-cmc-raIdentityWitness }

   id-cmc-raIdentityWitness OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-cmc 35}
</artwork></figure>

        <t>
          The above ASN.1 defines the following items:

          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="cmc-raIdentityWitness"> is a CMC-CONTROL associating the object identifier id-cmc-raIdentityWitness and the type BodyPartPath.  This object is omitted from the 1988 module. The object is added to the object set Cmc-Control-Set .  The control is permitted to appear only in the control
          sequence of a PKIData object.  It MUST NOT appear in the
          control sequence of a PKIResponse.  The control is permitted to
          be used only by an RA.  The control may appear multiple times in a control
          sequence with each occurrence pointing to a different object.
            </t>

            <t hangText="id-cmc-raIdentityWitness"> is the object identifier used to identify this CMC control.
            </t>

            <t hangText="BodyPartPath"> is the type structure associated with the control.  The syntax of BodyPartPath is defined in Section 3.2.2.  The path contains a sequence of body part identifiers leading to one of the following items:
              <list style="hanging">
                <t hangText="Identity Proof control"> if the RA verified the identity proof in this
                  control.</t>
                <t hangText="Identity Proof Version 2"> if the RA verified the identity proof in
                  this control.</t>
                <t hangText="Full PKI Request"> if the RA performed an out-of-band identity proof
                  for this request.  The request SHOULD NOT contain either Identity
                  Proof control.</t>
                <t hangText="Simple PKI Request"> if the RA performed an out-of-band identity proof
                  for this request.</t>
              </list>
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          The RA Identity Proof Witness control will frequently be associated
          with a Modify Certification Request control which changes the name
          fields in the associated certification requests.  This is because the RA
          knows the actual name to be assigned to the entity
          requesting the certificate and the end entity does not yet have the details of the
          name. <cref source="Kent">Sentence is too long</cref>  (The association would be set up by the operator
          at the time the shared secret was generated by the RA.)
        </t>

        <t>
          When this control is placed in a message, it is RECOMMENDED that the
          Control Processed control be placed in the body sequence as well.
          Using the explicit new control, rather than implicitly relying on the
          Control Processed control is important due to the need to know explicitly
          which identity proofs have been performed.  The new control also allows
          an RA to state that out-of-band identity proofs have been performed.
        </t>

	<t>
	  When the identity proof is performed by an RA, the RA also MUST validate the linking between the identity proof and the name information wrapped inside of the key proof-of-possession.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title="New Section 6.21 Response Body Control">
        <t>This item is to be added to the table in section 6.</t>

        <t>The Response Body Control is designed to enable an RA to inform an EE that there is an embedded response message that MUST be processed as part of the processing of this message.

          This control is designed to be used in a couple of different cases where an RA has done some additional processing for the certificate request, e.g., as key generation.

          When an RA performs key generation on behalf of an EE, the RA MUST respond with both the original response message from the certificate issuer (containing the certificate issuance) as part of the response generated by the RA (containing the new key).

          Another case where this is useful is when the secret is shared between the RA and the EE (rather than between the CA and the EE) and the RA returns the Publish Trust Anchors control (to populate the correct trust points).</t>

        <t>The relevant ASN.1 for the Response Body Control is as follows:</t>

        <figure><artwork>
  cmc-responseBody CMC-CONTROL ::= {
     BodyPartPath IDENTIFIED BY id-cmc-responseBody
  }

  id-cmc-responseBody OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-cmc 37}
</artwork></figure>

        <t>The above ASN.1 defines the following items:
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="cmc-responseBody"> is a CMC-CONTROL associating the object identifier id-cmc-responseBody with the type BodyPartPath.  This object is omitted from the 1988 module.  The object is added to the object set Cmc-Control-Set.  The control is permitted to appear only in the control sequence of a PKIResponse.  The control MUST NOT appear in the control sequence of a PKIData.  It is expected that only an intermediary RA will use this control; a CA generally does not need the control as it is creating the original innermost message.</t>
            <t hangText="id-cmc-responseBody"> is the object identifier used to identify this CMC control.</t>
            <t hangText="BodyPartPath"> is the type structure associated with the control.  The syntax of BodyPartPath is defined in Section 3.2.2.  The path contains a sequence of body part identifiers leading to a cmsSequence item which contains a PKIResponse within it.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="New Section 7. Other Attributes">
        <t>This section is to be inserted before the current section 7.</t>

        <t>There are a number of different locations where various types of attributes can be placed in either a CMC request or a CMC response message.
          These places include the attribute sequence of a PKCS #10 request,
          controls in CRMF (Section 6 of <xref target="RFC4211"/>)
          and the various CMS attribute sequences.</t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="New Section 7.1 Change Subject Name Attribute">
        <t>
          The Client Name Change Request Attribute is designed for a client to
          ask for a change in its name as part of a certificate request.  This cannot
          be done in the simple way of just changing the requested subject name
          in the certificate template because of security issues.  The name in
          the certificate request MUST match the name in the certificate
          used to verify the request, in order that identity and possession proofs
          are correctly applied.
        </t>

        <t>
          The relevant ASN.1 for the Client Name Change Request attribute is as
          follows:
        </t>

        <figure><artwork>
   at-cmc-changeSubjectName ATTRIBUTE ::=
      { ChangeSubjectName IDENTIFIED BY id-cmc-changeSubjectName }

   id-cmc-changeSubjectName OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-cmc 36}

   ChangeSubjectName ::= SEQUENCE {
       subject             Name OPTIONAL,
       subjectAlt          SubjectAltName OPTIONAL
   }
   (WITH COMPONENTS {..., subject PRESENT} |
         COMPONENTS {..., subjectAlt PRESENT} )
        </artwork></figure>

        <t>
          The attribute is designed to be used as an ATTRIBUTE object.  As such,
          the attribute is placed in one of the following two places:
          <list>
            <t>The attributes field in a CertificationRequest.</t>
            <t>The controls field of a CertRequest for a CRMF certification
              request.</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          The control is identified by the Object Identifier id-cmc-changeSubjectName.
        </t>

        <t>
          The ASN.1 type associated with control is ChangeSubjectName.  The
          fields of the structure are configured as follows:
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="subject"> contains the requested subject name for the new certificate.</t>

            <t hangText="subjectAlt"> contains the requested subject alternative name for the
              new certificate.</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          At least one of the fields in the sequence MUST be present when
          encoding the structure.
        </t>

        <t>
          When the CA processes this attribute in a certification request it
          will do the following:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>The subject field is copied to the name field of the template if
              present.  If the subject field is absent, the name field of the
              template will be set to a empty sequence.</t>
            <t>The subjectAlt field is used as the content of a SubjectAltName
              extension in the certificate if present.  The subjectAltName
              extension is removed from the certificate template if the
              subjectAlt field is absent.</t>
          </list>

        </t>

        <t>
          Certificates for servers used in the CMC protocol SHOULD conform to
          the profile defined in <xref target="RFC5280"/>.  This document defines some
          additional items that MAY appear in CMC server certificates.  Section
          9.1 defines some additional Extended Key Usage values that can appear
          in certificates.  Section 9.2 defines a new Subject Information
          Access value which allows for a CMC certificate to publish
          information on how to contact the services it provides.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="New Section 9.1. Extended Key Usage">

        <t>
          The Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension is used to restrict the use of
          a certificate to specific applications.  We define three different
          EKUs in this document.  The ASN.1 to define these EKUs is:
        </t>

        <figure><artwork>

   id-kp-cmcRA OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp 28 }
   id-kp-cmcArchive OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp 29 }
        </artwork></figure>

        <t>
          The usage description for each of the EKUs is as follows:
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="CMC Certification Authorities"> are identified by the id-kp-cmcCA
      extended key usage.  The certificate may be the same as the CA

      different certificate is used, the certificates containing the id-kp-cmcCA extended key usage SHOULD have the same name as
      the certificate used for issuing the certificates.  (Using a
      separate key pair for CMC protocol operations and for issuing
      Certificates and CRLs decreases the number of operations for which
      the private key used to sign certificates and CRLs would be used.)</t>

            <t hangText="CMC Registration Authorities"> are identified by the id-kp-cmcRA

      <section title="New Section 9.2. Subject Information Access">

        <t>
   The subject information access extension indicates how to access 
   information and services for the subject of the certificate.  We
   define a new value for use in this extension, to identify the
   different locations that CMC services will be available.  If this
   value is placed in a certificate, an appropriate extended key usage
   defined in section 9.1 MUST be included in the certificate as well.
   </t>

        <t>
   The id-ad-cmc OID is used when the subject offers certification
   services using the CMC Protocol.  If the CMC services are
   available via HTTP or FTP, accessLocation MUST be a
   uniformResourceIdentifier.  If the CMC services are available via
   electronic mail, accessLocation MUST be an rfc822Name.  If CMC
   services are available using TCP/IP, the dNSName or iPAddress name
   forms MUST be used. Since the GeneralName data structure does not permit the inclusion of a port number, in the absence of other external configuration information, the value of TBD1 should be used. (The port registration is in Section 3.2.)<!-- change this to xref section 6 of RFC 5273 after updates -->
  The semantics of other name forms of
   accessLocation (when accessMethod is id-ad-cmc) are not defined by
   this specification.

          The ASN.1 for this extension is:  GeneralName

      <section title="Updates Section 8. Security Considerations">
        <t>The following paragraphs are to be added to the end of section 8.</t>
        <t>A number of controls such as the RA Identity Proof Witness control exist for an RA to either make assertions about or modify a certificate request.
          Any upstream request processor, such as a CA, MUST verify that the RA is fully identified and authorized to make assertion or modification it is claiming.
          If it is not identified or authorized then any request MUST be rejected.</t>
        <t>CMC servers, both RAs and CAs, need to due diligence in checking the contents of a certificate request.  At an absolute minimum all fields should be checked to ensure that the policies of the CA/RA are correctly enforced.  While all fields need to be checked, special care should be taken with names, name forms, algorithm choices and algorithm parameters.</t>

    <section title="Updates to RFC 5273 - Certificate Management over CMS (CMC): Transport Protocols">
      <section title="Update to Section 5 TCP-Based Protocol">
        <t>The following replaces paragraph 3 in section 5.</t>
        <t>CMC requires a registered port number to send and receive CMC messages over TCP.  The title of this IP Protocol number is "pkix-cmc".  The value of this TCP port is TBD1.</t>
        <t>Prior to this update, CMC did not have a registred port number and used an externally configured port from the Private Port range.  Client implementations MAY want to continue to allow for this to occur.  Servers SHOULD change to use the new port.  It is expected that HTTP will continue to be the primary transport method used by CMC installations.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="New Section 6. IANA Considerations">
        <t>This is a new section to be inserted before the current section 6.</t>
        <t>IANA is requested to assign a TCP port number in the Registered Port Number range for the use of CMC.

   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
   capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
   interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
   should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

<list>
<t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

<t>This document defines the base syntax for CMC, a Certificate Management protocol using the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS). This protocol addresses two immediate needs within the Internet Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) community:&lt;/t>&lt;t> 1. The need for an interface to public key certification products and services based on CMS and PKCS #10 (Public Key Cryptography Standard), and&lt;/t>&lt;t> 2. The need for a PKI enrollment protocol for encryption only keys due to algorithm or hardware design.&lt;/t>&lt;t> CMC also requires the use of the transport document and the requirements usage document along with this document for a full definition.

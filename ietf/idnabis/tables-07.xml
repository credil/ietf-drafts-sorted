      <t>This document specifies rules for deciding whether a code point,
      considered in isolation or in context, is a candidate for inclusion in an
      Internationalized Domain Name.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC4690">RFC 4690</xref>suggests an inclusion based
      approach for selecting the code points from <xref target="Unicode51">The
      Unicode Standard</xref> that should be included in the list of code
      points that may be used in Internationalized Domain Names.</t>

      <t>Specifically, <xref target="RFC4690">RFC 4690</xref> says the
      following:</t>

      <t>
        <list style="empty">
          <t>The IAB has concluded that there is a consensus within the
          broader community that lists of code points should be specified by
          the use of an inclusion-based mechanism (i.e., identifying the
          characters that are permitted), rather than by excluding a small
          number of characters from the total Unicode set as <xref
          target="RFC3454">Stringprep</xref> and <xref
          target="RFC3491">Nameprep</xref> do today. That conclusion should be
          reviewed by the IETF community and action taken as appropriate.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>This document reviews and classifies the collections of code points
      in the Unicode character set by examining various properties of the code
      points. It then defines an algorithm for determining a derived property
      value. It specifies a procedure, and not a table, of code points so that
      the algorithm can be used to determine code point sets independent of
      the version of Unicode that is in use.</t>

      <t>This document is not intended to specify precisely how these property
      values are to be applied in IDN labels. That information appears in
      <xref target="IDNA2008-protocol" />, but it is important to understand
      that the assignment of a value of this property to a particular
      character is not sufficient to determine whether it can be used in a
      given label. In particular, some combinations of allowed code points are
      not advisable for use in IDNs due to rules specific to a script or class
      of characters. The requirement for such rules is linked to the
      operations in <xref target="IDNA2008-protocol" /> and especially to the
      characters designated as requiring contextual rules.</t>

      <t>The value of the property is to be interpreted approximately as
      follows.</t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>PROTOCOL VALID: Those that are allowed to be used in IDNs. Code
          points with this property value are permitted for general use in
          IDNs. However, that a label consists only of code points that
					have this property value does not imply that the label can be
					used in DNS. See <xref target="IDNA2008-protocol" /> for algorithms
          to make decisions about labels in domain names. The abbreviated term PVALID is
          used to refer to this value in the rest of this document.<vspace/></t>

          <t>CONTEXTUAL RULE REQUIRED: Some characteristics of the character,
          such as it being invisible in certain contexts or problematic in
          others, requires that it not be used in labels unless specific other
          characters or properties are present. The abbreviated term CONTEXT
          is used to refer to this value in the rest of this document. There
          are two subdivisions of CONTEXTUAL RULE REQUIRED, one for
          Join_controls (called CONTEXTJ) and for other characters (called
          CONTEXTO). These are discussed in more detail below and in <xref
          target="IDNA2008-protocol" />.<vspace/></t>

          <t>DISALLOWED: Those that should clearly not be included in IDNs.
          Code points with this property value are not permitted in IDNs.<vspace/></t>

          <t>UNASSIGNED: Those code points that are not designated
          (i.e. are unassigned) in the Unicode Standard.<vspace/></t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
	      The mechanisms described here allow determination of the value of the
        property for future versions of Unicode (including characters added
        after Unicode 5.1). Changes in Unicode properties that do not affect the outcome
        of this process do not affect IDN. For example, a character can have
        its Unicode General_Category value change from So to Sm, or from Lo to
        Ll, without affecting the algorithm results. Moreover, even if such
        changes were to result, the <xref target="G">BackwardCompatible
        list</xref> can be adjusted to ensure the stability of the results.
		  </t>

      <t>Some code points need to be allowed in exceptional circumstances, but
      should be excluded in all other cases; these rules are also described in
      other documents. The most notable of these are the the Join Control
      characters, U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER and U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER.
      Both of them have the derived property value CONTEXTJ. A character with
      the derived property value CONTEXTJ or CONTEXTO (CONTEXTUAL RULE
      REQUIRED) is not to be used unless an appropriate rule has been
      established and the context of the character is consistent with that
      rule. It is invalid to either register a string containing these
      characters or even to look one up unless such contextual rule is found
      and satisfied. Please see <xref target="RulesInit"/>, The Contextual Rules Registry,
      for more information.</t>

      <t>This document is part of a series that, together, constitute a
      proposal for updating the IDNA standards to resolve issues
      uncovered in recent years, cover a broader range of scripts, and provide
      for migration to newer versions of Unicode. See <xref
      target="IDNA2008-rationale" /> for a broader discussion.</t>

    <section anchor="Categories"
             title="Category definitions Used to Calculate Derived Property Value">
        <t>The derived property obtains its value based on a two-step
        procedure. First, characters are placed in one or more character
        categories based on either core properties defined by the Unicode Standard
        or by treating the codepoint as an exception and addressing the codepoint
        by its codepoint value. These categories are not mutually exclusive.</t>

        <t>In the second step, set operations are used with these categories
        to determine the values for an IDN-specific property. Those operations
        are specified in <xref target="PropertyCalculation" />.</t>

        <t>Unicode property names and property value names may have short
        abbreviations, such as gc for the General_Category property, and Ll
        for the Lowercase_Letter property value of the gc property.</t>

				<t>In the following specification of categories, the operation
				which returns the value of a particular Unicode character
				property for a code point is designated by using the
				formal name of that property (from PropertyAliases.txt)
				followed by '(cp)'. For example, the value of the
				General_Category property for a code point is indicated
				by General_Category(cp).

    <appendix title="Contextual Rules Registry" anchor="RulesInit">
	   <t>
		   As discussed in <xref target="IANAContext"/> and in the IANA
       Considerations section of <xref target="IDNA2008-rationale"/>, a
       registry of rules that define the contexts in which particular
       PROTOCOL-VALID characters, characters associated with a requirement for
       Contextual Information, are permitted. These rules are expressed as
       tests on the label in which the characters appear (all, or any part of,
       the label may be tested).
     </t>

     <t>
			The grammatical rules are expressed in pseudo code. The conventions used
      for that pseudo code are explained here.
		 </t>
		 <t>
		   Each rule is constructed as a Boolean expression that evaluates to
       either True or False. A simple "True;" or "False;" rule sets the
       default result value for the rule set. Subsequent conditional rules
       that evaluate to True or False may re-set the result value.
		 </t>
		 <t>
		   A special value "Undefined" is used to deal with any error conditions,
       such as an attempt to test a character before the start of a label or
       after the end of a label. If any term of a rule evaluates to Undefined,
       further evaluation of the rule immediately terminates, as the result
       value of the rule will itself be Undefined.
		 </t>
		 <list style="hanging">
	     <t><vspace/>
		     cp represents the codepoint to be tested.
		   </t>
	     <t><vspace/>
		     FirstChar is a special term which denotes the first codepoint in a
         label.
	     </t>
	     <t><vspace/>
	       LastChar is a special term which denotes the last codepoint in a
         label.

         .eq. represents the equality relation.

			     A .eq. B evaluates to True if A equals B.

       <list style="hanging">
		     <t><vspace/>
			     A .ne. B evaluates to True if A is not equal to B.
			   </t>
       </list>
       <t><vspace/>
         .in. represents the set inclusion relation.
       </t>
       <list style="hanging">
		     <t><vspace/>

		   A functional notation, Function_Name(cp), is used to express either
       string positions within a label, Boolean character property tests of a
       codepoint, or a regular expression match. When such function names
       refer to Boolean character property tests, the function names use the
       exact Unicode character property name for the property in question, and
       "cp" is evaluated as the Unicode value of the codepoint to be tested,
       rather than as its position in the label. When such function names
       refer to string positions within a label, "cp" is evaluated as its
       position in the label.
		 </t>
		 <t>
		   RegExpMatch(X) takes as its parameter X a schematic regular expression
       consisting of a mix of Unicode character property values and literal
       Unicode codepoints.
		 </t>
		 <t>
		   Script(cp) returns the value of the Unicode Script property, as defined
       in Scripts.txt in the Unicode Character Database.
		 </t>
		 <t>
		   Canonical_Combining_Class(cp) returns the value of the Unicode
       Canonical_Combining_Class property, as defined in UnicodeData.txt in
       the Unicode Character Database.
	   </t>
		 <t>
		   Before(cp) returns the codepoint of the character immediately preceding
       cp in logical order in the string representing the label.
       Before(FirstChar) evaluates to Undefined.
		 </t>
		 <t>
		   After(cp) returns the codepoint of the character immediately following
       cp in logical order in the string representing the label.
       After(LastChar) evaluates to Undefined.
		 </t>
		 <t>
			 Note that "Before" and "After" do not refer to the visual display order
       of the character in a label, which may be reversed or otherwise
       modified by the bidirectional algorithm for labels including characters
       from scripts written right-to-left. Instead,
			 'Before' and 'After' refer to the network order of the character in
			 the label.
		 </t>
		 <t>
			 The clauses "Then True" and "Then False" imply exit from the
       pseudo-code routine with the corresponding result.
		 </t>
		 <t>
		   Repeated evaluation for all characters in a label makes use of the
       special construct:
		 </t>
		 <list style="hanging">
		   <t><vspace/>
			   For All Characters:
			 </t>
			 <list style="hanging">
			   <t>
				   Expression;
				 </t>
			 </list>
			 <t>
			   End For;
       </t>
		 </list>
		 <t>
		   This construct requires repeated evaluation of "Expression" for each
       codepoint in the label, starting from FirstChar and proceeding to
       LastChar.
		 </t>
     <t>
       The different fields in the rules are to be interpreted as follows:
     </t>
			<list style="hanging">
				<t hangText="Code point: "><vspace/>
					The codepoint, or codepoints, that this rule is to be applied to.
          Normally, this implies that if any of the codepoints in a label is
          as defined, then the rules should be applied. If evaluated to True,
          the codepoint is ok as used; if evaluated to False, it is not o.k.
				</t>
				<t hangText="Overview: "><vspace/>
					A description of the goal with the rule, in plain English.
				</t>
				<t hangText="Lookup: "><vspace/>

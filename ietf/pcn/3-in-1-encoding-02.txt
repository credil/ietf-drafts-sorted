Abstract

   The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the
   quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain.
   The overall rate of the PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the
   PCN-domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain
   configured rates are exceeded.  The level of marking allows the
   boundary nodes to make decisions about whether to admit or block a
   new flow request, and (in abnormal circumstances) whether to
   terminate some of the existing flows, thereby protecting the QoS of
   previously admitted flows.  This document specifies how such marks
   are to be encoded into the IP header by re-using the Explicit
   Congestion Notification (ECN) codepoints within this controlled
   domain.  This encoding builds on the baseline encoding and provides
   for three PCN encoding states: Not-marked, Threshold-marked and
   Excess-traffic-marked.

1.  Introduction

   The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) [RFC5559] is to
   protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a
   Diffserv domain, in a simple, scalable, and robust fashion.  Two
   mechanisms are used: admission control, to decide whether to admit or
   block a new flow request, and (in abnormal circumstances) flow
   termination to decide whether to terminate some of the existing
   flows.  To achieve this, the overall rate of PCN-traffic is metered
   on every link in the domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked
   when certain configured rates are exceeded.  These configured rates
   are below the rate of the link thus providing notification to
   boundary nodes about overloads before any congestion occurs (hence
   "pre-congestion notification").

   The level of marking allows boundary nodes to make decisions about
   whether to admit or terminate.  This is achieved by marking packets
   on interior nodes according to some metering function implemented at
   each node.  Threshold-traffic-marking marks all PCN packets once they
   exceed the threshold-traffic-rate on a link while Excess-traffic-
   marking marks only those PCN packets that exceed the excess-traffic-
   rate, which is higher than the threshold-traffic-rate [RFC5670].
   These marks are monitored by the egress nodes of the PCN domain.

   To fully support these two types of marking, three encoding states
   are needed.  The baseline encoding described in [RFC5696] provides
   for deployment scenarios that only require two PCN encoding states
   using a single Diffserv codepoint.  This document describes an
   experimental extension to the baseline-encoding that adds a third PCN
   encoding state in the IP header, still using a single Diffserv

   codepoint.  For brevity it will be called the 3-in-1 PCN Encoding.

   General PCN-related terminology is defined in the PCN architecture
   [RFC5559], and terminology specific to packet encoding is defined in
   the PCN baseline encoding [RFC5696].  Note that [RFC5696] requires
   the PCN Working Group to maintain a list of all DSCPs used for PCN
   experiments.

3.  The Requirement for Three PCN Encoding States

   The PCN architecture [RFC5559] describes proposed PCN schemes that
   expect traffic to be metered and marked using both Threshold and
   Excess Traffic schemes.  In order to achieve this it is necessary to
   allow for three PCN encoding states: one as a Not Marked (NM) state
   and the other two to distinguish these two levels of marking severity
   [RFC5670].  The way tunnels processed the ECN field before
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-tunnel] severely limited how to encode these
   states.

   The two bit ECN field seems to offer four possible encoding states,
   but one (00) is set aside for traffic controlled by transports that
   do not understand PCN marking [RFC5696], so it would be irregular and
   risky to use it as a PCN encoding state.  Of the three remaining ECN
   codepoints, only one (11) can be introduced by a congested node
   within a tunnel and still survive the decapsulation behaviour of a
   tunnel egress not updated to comply with [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-tunnel].
   The two remaining codepoints are (10) and (01).  But if a node within
   the tunnel used either of these two remaining codepoints to try to
   mark packets with a second severity level, a tunnel not updated to
   comply with [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-tunnel] would remove this marking on
   decapsulation.  The ECN field was constrained to two marking states
   in this way irrespective of which earlier ECN tunnelling
   specification the tunnel complied with, whether regular IP in IP
   tunnelling [RFC3168] or IPsec tunnelling [RFC4301].

   One way to provide another encoding state that survives tunnelling is
   to use a second Diffserv codepoint [I-D.ietf-pcn-3-state-encoding].
   Instead, to avoid wasting scarce Diffserv codepoints, a network
   operator can require tunnels in a PCN region to comply with
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-tunnel], thus removing the constraints imposed by
   earlier tunnelling specifications.

   Therefore this document presupposes tunnels in the PCN region comply
   with the newly proposed decapsulation rules defined in
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-tunnel].  Then the constraints of standard
   tunnels no longer apply so this document can define a 3-state
   encoding for PCN within one Diffserv codepoint.


4.  The 3-in-1 PCN Encoding

   The 3-in-1 PCN Encoding scheme is based closely on the baseline
   encoding defined in [RFC5696] so that there will be no compatibility
   issues if a PCN-domain evolves from using the baseline encoding
   scheme to the experimental scheme described here.  The exact manner
   in which the PCN encoding states are carried in the IP header is

         +--------+--------------+-------------+-------------+---------+

                       Figure 1: 3-in-1 PCN Encoding

   In Figure 1 the 3 PCN states are encoded in the ECN field [RFC3168]
   of an IP packet with its Diffserv field [RFC2474] set to DSCP n,
   which is any PCN-Compatible DiffServ codepoint as defined in Section
   4.2 of the PCN baseline encoding [RFC5696]).  The PCN codepoint of a
   packet defines its marking state as follows:

   Not-PCN:  The packet is controlled by a transport that does not
      understand PCN marking, therefore the only valid action to notify
      congestion is to drop the packet;

   NM:  Not marked.  A packet in the NM state has not (yet) had its
      marking state changed to the ThM or ETM states, but it may be
      changed to one of these states by a node experiencing congestion
      or pre-congestion;

   ThM:  Threshold-marked.  Such a packet has had its marking state
      changed by the threshold-meter function [RFC5670];

   ETM:  Excess-traffic-marked.  Such a packet has had its marking state
      changed by the excess-traffic-meter function [RFC5670].

   Packets marked NM, ThM or ETM are termed PCN-packets.  Their entry
   into the pcn-domain is controlled by edge nodes that understand how
   to process PCN markings [RFC5559].


5.  Behaviour of a PCN Node Compliant with the 3-in-1 PCN Encoding

   To be compliant with the 3-in-1 PCN Encoding, an PCN interior node
   behaves as follows:

   o  Except where explicitly stated otherwise, it MUST comply with the
      baseline encoding specified in [RFC5696]

   o  It MUST change NM to ThM if the threshold-meter function indicates
      to mark the packet.

   o  It MUST change NM or ThM to ETM if the excess-traffic-meter
      function indicates to mark the packet.

   o  It MUST NOT change Not-PCN to a PCN-Enabled codepoint and MUST NOT
      change a PCN-Enabled codepoint to Not-PCN;

   o  It MUST NOT change ThM to NM;

   o  It MUST NOT change ETM to ThM or to NM;

   In other words, a PCN interior node may increase the severity of
   packet marking but it MUST NOT decrease it, where the order of
   severity increases from NM through ThM to ETM.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


7.  Security Considerations

   The security concerns relating to this extended PCN encoding are the
   same as those in [RFC5696].


8.  Conclusions

   The 3-in-1 PCN Encoding provides three states to encode PCN markings
   in the ECN field of an IP packet using just one Diffserv codepoint.
   One state is for not marked packets while the two others are for PCN
   nodes to mark packets with increasing levels of severity.  Use of
   this encoding presupposes that any tunnels in the PCN region have
   been updated to comply with [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-tunnel].

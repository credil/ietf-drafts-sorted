The purpose of this document is to make the Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES) Key Wrap algorithm conveniently available to the
Internet community.  The United States of America has adopted AES
as the new encryption standard.  The AES Key Wrap algorithm will
probably be adopted by the USA for encryption of AES keys.
The authors took most of the text in this document from the draft
AES Key Wrap posted by NIST.

This document is a product of the S/MIME Mail Security Working Group
of the IETF.

    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a type-length-value (TLV) for use in the
      IS-IS routing protocol that allows for the proper use of the
      Bidirectional Forwarding Detection protocol (BFD). There exist certain
      scenarios in which IS-IS will not react appropriately to a BFD detected
      forwarding plane failure without use of either this TLV or some other
      method.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The <xref target="RFC5880">Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
      protocol</xref> is a protocol that allows for detection of a forwarding
      plane failure between two routers. A router can use <xref
      target="RFC5880"></xref> to validate that a peer router's forwarding
      ability is functioning.</t>

      <t>One specific application of BFD as described in <xref
      target="RFC5882"></xref> is to verify the forwarding ability of an IS-IS
      <xref target="RFC1195"></xref> router's adjacencies; however, the method
      described in <xref target="RFC5882"></xref> does not allow for certain
      failure scenarios. We will define a TLV that will allow for proper
      response to the detection of all forwarding failures where the use of
      BFD is employed with IS-IS.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="The Problem">
      <t>We observe that to allow for mixed use (i.e., some routers running
      BFD and some not) <xref target="RFC5882"></xref> does not require a BFD
      session be established prior to the establishment of an IS-IS adjacency.
      Thus, if a router A has neighbors B and C, and B does not support BFD, A
      would still form adjacencies with B and C, and would only establish a
      BFD session with C.</t>

      <t>The problem with this solution is that it assumes that the
      transmission and receipt of IS-IS Hellos (IIHs) shares fate with
      forwarded data packets. This is not a fair assumption to make given that
      the primary use of BFD is to protect IPv4 (and IPv6) forwarding and
      IS-IS does not utilize IPv4 or IPv6 for sending or receiving its
      hellos.</t>

      <t>Thus, if we consider our previous example, and if C is currently
      experiencing an IPv4 forwarding failure that allows for IIHs to be sent
      and received, when A first starts (or restarts) A will assume that C
      simply does not support BFD, will form an adjacency with C, and may
      incorrectly forward IPv4 traffic through C.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="The Solution">
      <t>A simple solution to this problem is for an IS-IS router to advertise
      that it has BFD enabled on a given interface. It can do this through the
      inclusion of a TLV in its IIHs as described in this document.</t>

      <t>When sending an IIH on a BFD enabled interface, a router which
      supports this extension MUST include the BFD enabled TLV in its IIH. The
      contents of the TLV MUST indicate what topologies/protocols <xref
      target="RFC5120"></xref> have been enabled for BFD by including the
      appropriate Multi-Topology Identifier (MTID)/ Network Layer Protocol
      Identifier (NLPID) pairs.</t>

      <t>When sending an IIH on an interface on which BFD is NOT enabled a
      router MUST NOT include the BFD enabled TLV.</t>

      <section title="State Definitions">
        <t>The following definitions apply to each IS-IS neighbor:</t>

        <t>For each locally supported MTID/NLPID pair, an
        "ISIS_TOPO_NLPID_BFD_REQUIRED" variable is assigned. If BFD is
        supported by both the local system and the neighbor for the MTID/NLPID
        this variable is set to "TRUE". Otherwise the variable is set to
        "FALSE".</t>

        <t>For each locally supported MTID, an "ISIS_TOPO_BFD_REQUIRED"
        variable is set to the logical "OR" of all
        "ISIS_TOPO_NLPID_BFD_REQUIRED" variables associated with that
        MTID.</t>

        <t>An "ISIS_BFD_REQUIRED" variable is set to the logical "AND" of all
        "ISIS_TOPO_BFD_REQUIRED" variables.</t>

        <t>For each locally supported MTID/NLPID pair, an
        "ISIS_TOPO_NLPID_STATE" variable is assigned. If
        "ISIS_TOPO_NLPID_BFD_REQUIRED" is "TRUE", this variable follows the
        BFD session state for that MTID/NLPID ("UP == TRUE"). Otherwise the
        variable is set to "TRUE".</t>

        <t>For each locally supported topology (MTID), an "ISIS_TOPO_USEABLE"
        variable is set to the logical "AND" of the set of
        "ISIS_TOPO_NLPID_STATE" variables associated with that MTID.</t>

        <t>An "ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE" variable is set to the logical "OR" of
        all "ISIS_TOPO_USEABLE" variables.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Adjacency Establishment and Maintenance">
        <t>Whenever "ISIS_BFD_REQUIRED" is "TRUE" the following extensions to
        the rules for adjacency establishment and maintenance MUST apply:<list
            style="symbols">
            <t>"ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE" MUST be "TRUE" before the adjacency can
            transition from "INIT" to "UP" state</t>

            <t>When the IS-IS adjacency is "UP" and "ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE"
            becomes "FALSE" the IS-IS adjacency MUST transition to "DOWN".</t>

            <t>On a Point-to-Point circuit whenever "ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE" is
            "FALSE", the Three-Way adjacency state MUST be set to "DOWN" in
            the Point-to-Point Three Way Adjacency TLV<xref
            target="RFC5303"></xref> in all transmitted IIHs.</t>

            <t>On a LAN circuit whenever "ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE" is "FALSE",
            the IS Neighbors TLV advertising the MAC address of the neighbor
            MUST be omitted in all transmitted IIHs.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Advertisement of Topology Specific IS Neighbors">
        <t>The advertisement of a topology specific IS-neighbor (as well as
        the use of the neighbor in the topology specific decision process) is
        determined by the value of "ISIS_TOPO_USEABLE" for each topology. If
        "ISIS_TOPO_USEABLE" is "TRUE" then the topology specific neighbor is
        advertised. If "ISIS_TOPO_USEABLE" is "FALSE" then the topology
        specific neighbor is not advertised.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Transition">
      <t>To allow for a non-disruptive transition to the use of BFD some
      amount of time should be allowed before bringing down an "UP" adjacency
      on a BFD enabled interface when the value of "ISIS_BFD_REQUIRED" becomes
      "TRUE" as a result of the introduction of the BFD TLV or the
      modification (by adding a new supported MTID/NLPID) of an existing BFD
      TLV in a neighbor's IIH. A simple way to do this is to not update the
      adjacency hold-time when receiving such an IIH from a neighbor with whom
      we have an "UP" adjacency until "ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE" becomes
      "TRUE".</t>

      <t>If the value of "ISIS_BFD_REQUIRED" becomes "FALSE" as a result of
      the removal the BFD TLV or the modification (by removing a supported
      MTID/NLPID) of an existing BFD TLV in a neighbor's IIH then BFD session
      establishment is no longer required to maintain the adjacency or
      transition the adjacency to the "UP" state.</t>

      <t>If a BFD session is administratively shut down <xref
      target="RFC5880"></xref> and the BFD session state change impacts the
      value of "ISIS_NEIGHBOR_USEABLE", then IS-IS SHOULD allow time for the
      corresponding MTID/NLPID to be removed from the neighbor's BFD TLV by
      not updating the adjacency hold time until "ISIS_BFD_REQUIRED" becomes
      "FALSE". Note that while this allows a non-disruptive transition, it
      still enforces consistency between the administrative state of the BFD
      session and the MTID/NLPID(s) advertised in the BFD TLV. This is
      necessary to provide consistent behavior regardless of whether the BFD
      AdminDown state is introduced before or after an IS-IS adjacency "UP"
      state has been achieved.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Graceful Restart">
      <t>This section describes IS-IS implementation considerations when both
      both IS-IS graceful restart <xref target="RFC5306"></xref> and BFD are
      co-deployed.</t>

      <t>In cases where BFD shares fate with the control plane, it can be
      expected that BFD session failure may occur in conjunction with the
      control plane restart. In such cases premature abort of IS-IS graceful
      restart as a result of BFD session failure is undesirable. Therefore,
      some mechanism to ignore the BFD session failure for a limited period of
      time would be beneficial. The issue of the interaction between graceful
      restart and BFD is described at length in RFC5882. The implementation of
      this interaction is outside the scope of this document.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="The BFD Enabled TLV">
      <t>The BFD enabled TLV is formatted as shown below. The TLV SHALL only
      be included in an IIH and only when BFD is enabled for one or more
      supported MTID/protocols on the interface over which the IIH is being
      sent. The NLPIDs encoded in the TLV are defined in <xref
      target="ISO9577"></xref></t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The TLV defined within this document describes an addition to the
      IS-IS Hello protocol. Inappropriate use of this TLV could prevent an
      IS-IS adjacency from forming or lead to failure to detect bidirectional
      forwarding failures - each of which is a form of denial of service.
      However, a party who can manipulate the contents of this TLV is already
      in a position to create such a denial of service by disrupting IS-IS
      routing in other ways.</t>

      <t>Note that the introduction of this TLV has no impact on the

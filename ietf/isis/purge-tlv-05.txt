             Purge Originator Identification TLV for IS-IS
                      draft-ietf-isis-purge-tlv-05

Abstract

   At present an IS-IS purge does not contain any information
   identifying the Intermediate System (IS) that generates the purge.
   This makes it difficult to locate the source IS.

   To address this issue, this document defines a TLV to be added to
   purges to record the system ID of the IS generating it.  Since normal
   LSP flooding does not change LSP contents, this TLV should propagate
   with the purge.

Internet-Draft     Purge Originator Identification TLV      October 2010


1.  Introduction

   The IS-IS [ISO 10589] routing protocol has been widely used in large-
   scale IP networks because of its strong scalability and fast
   convergence.

   The IS-IS protocol floods purges throughout an area, regardless of
   which IS initiated the purge.  If a network operator would like to
   investigate the cause of the purge, it is difficult to determine the
   origin of the purge.  At present the IS-IS protocol has no mechanism
   to locate the originator of a purge.  To address this problem, this
   document defines a TLV to be added to purges to record the system ID
   of the IS generating the purge.

   Field experience has observed several circumstances where an IS can
   improperly generate a purge.  These are all due to implementation
   deficiencies or implementations that predate [ISO TC1] and generate a
   purge when they receive a corrupted LSP.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  The Purge Originator Identification (POI) TLV

   This document defines a TLV to be included in purges.  If an IS
   generates a purge, it SHOULD include this TLV in the purge with its
   own system ID.  If an IS receives a purge that does not include this
   TLV, then it SHOULD add this TLV with both its own system ID and the
   system ID of the IS that it received the purge from.  This allows ISs
   receiving purges to log the system ID of the originator, or the
   upstream source of the purge.  This makes it much easier for the
   network administrator to locate the origin of the purge and thus the
   cause of the purge.  Similarly, this TLV is helpful to developers in
   lab situations.

   The POI TLV is defined as:

   CODE - 13

   LENGTH - total length of the value field.

   VALUE -

      Number of system IDs carried in this TLV (1 octet) -- Only the
      values 1 and 2 are defined.

      System ID of the Intermediate System that inserted this TLV.

      System ID of the Intermediate System that the purge was received
      from. (optional)

   The POI TLV SHOULD be found in all purges and MUST NOT be found in
   LSPs with a non-zero Remaining Lifetime.


4.  Using the Dynamic Hostname TLV in Purges

   This document also extends the use of the Dynamic hostname TLV (type
   137) [RFC5301] to further aid in the rapid identification of the
   system that generated the purge.  This TLV MAY be included in purges.
   Implementations SHOULD include one instance of Dynamic hostname TLV
   if the POI TLV is included.  Only the local hostname should be
   inserted.


5.  Security Considerations

   Use of the extensions defined here with authentication as defined in
   [RFC5304] or [RFC5310] will result in the discarding of purges by
   legacy systems which are in strict conformance with either of those
   RFCs.  This may compromise the correctness/consistency of the routing
   database unless all ISs in the network support these extensions.
   Therefore, all implementations in a domain implementing
   authentication MUST be upgraded to receive the POI TLV before any IS
   is allowed to generate a purge with the POI TLV.

   More interactions between the POI TLV, the Dynamic hostname TLV, and
   the Authentication TLV are described in [I-D.ietf-isis-reg-purge].


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA assign code point 13 for the 'Purge
   Originator Identification' TLV from the IS-IS 'TLV Codepoints
   Registry'.  The additional values for this TLV should be: IIH:n,
   LSP:y, SNP:n, Purge:y.

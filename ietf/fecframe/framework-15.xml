    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a framework for using Forward Error
      Correction (FEC) codes with applications in public and private IP
      networks to provide protection against packet loss. The framework
      supports applying FEC to arbitrary packet flows over unreliable
      transport and is primarily intended for real-time, or streaming, media.
      This framework can be used to define Content Delivery Protocols that
      provide FEC for streaming media delivery or other packet flows. Content
      Delivery Protocols defined using this framework can support any FEC
      scheme (and associated FEC codes) which is compliant with various
      requirements defined in this document. Thus, Content Delivery Protocols
      can be defined which are not specific to a particular FEC scheme, and
      FEC schemes can be defined which are not specific to a particular
      Content Delivery Protocol.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Many applications have a requirement to transport a continuous stream
      of packetized data from a source (sender) to one or more destinations
      (receivers) over networks which do not provide guaranteed packet
      delivery. Primary examples are real-time, or streaming, media
      applications such as broadcast, multicast or on-demand audio, video or
      multimedia.</t>

      <t>Forward Error Correction (FEC) is a well-known technique for
      improving reliability of packet transmission over networks which do not
      provide guaranteed packet delivery, especially in multicast and
      broadcast applications. The FEC Building Block defined in <xref
      target="RFC5052"></xref> provides a framework for definition of Content
      Delivery Protocols (CDPs) for object delivery (including, primarily,
      file delivery) which make use of separately defined FEC schemes. Any CDP
      defined according to the requirements of the FEC Building Block can then
      easily be used with any FEC scheme which is also defined according to
      the requirements of the FEC Building Block.</t>

      <t>Note that the term "Forward Erasure Correction" is sometimes used,
      erasures being a type of error in which data is lost and this loss can
      be detected, rather than being received in corrupted form. The focus of
      this document is strictly on erasures and, the term "Forward Error
      Correction" is more widely used.</t>

      <t>This document defines a framework for the definition of CDPs which
      provide for FEC protection for arbitrary packet flows over unreliable
      transports such as UDP. As such, this document complements the FEC
      Building Block of <xref target="RFC5052"></xref>, by providing for the
      case of arbitrary packet flows over unreliable transport, the same kind
      of framework as that document provides for object delivery. This
      document does not define a complete CDP, but rather defines only those
      aspects that are expected to be common to all CDPs based on this
      framework.</t>

      <t>This framework does not define how the flows to be protected are
      determined, nor how the details of the protected flows and the FEC
      streams which protect them are communicated from sender to receiver. It
      is expected that any complete CDP specification which makes use of this
      framework will address these signaling requirements. However, this
      document does specify the information which is required by the FEC
      Framework at the sender and receiver, e.g., details of the flows to be
      FEC protected, the flow(s) that will carry the FEC protection data and
      an opaque container for FEC-Scheme-Specific Information.</t>

      <t>FEC schemes designed for use with this framework must fulfill a
      number of requirements defined in this document. These requirements are
      different from those defined in <xref target="RFC5052"></xref> for FEC
      schemes for object delivery. However, there is a great deal of
      commonality and FEC schemes defined for object delivery may be easily
      adapted for use with the framework defined in this document.</t>

      <t>Since the RTP protocol is (often) used over UDP, this framework can
      be applied to RTP flows as well. FEC repair packets may be sent directly
      over UDP or RTP. The latter approach has the advantage that RTP
      instrumentation, based on RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), can be used for
      the repair flow. Additionally, the post-repair RTCP extended reports
      <xref target="RFC5725"></xref> may be used to obtain information about
      the loss rate after FEC recovery.</t>

      <t>The use of RTP for repair flows is defined for each FEC scheme by
      defining an RTP payload format for that particular FEC scheme (possibly
      in the same document).</t>

      payload to the transport layer.</t>

      <t>ADU Flow: A sequence of ADUs associated with a transport-layer flow

      the operation of the FEC Framework.</t>

      <t>FEC Payload ID: Information which identifies the contents of a packet
      with respect to the FEC scheme.</t>

      <t>FEC Repair Packet: At a sender (respectively, at a receiver) a
      payload submitted to (respectively, received from) the transport

    </section>

    <section title="Architecture Overview">
      <t>The FEC Framework is described in terms of an additional layer
      between the transport layer (e.g., UDP or DCCP) and protocols running
      over this transport layer. As such, the data path interface between the
      FEC Framework and both underlying and overlying layers can be thought of
      as being the same as the standard interface to the transport layer,
      i.e., the data exchanged consists of datagram payloads each associated
      with a single ADU flow identified by the standard 5-tuple {Source IP
      address, source port, destination IP address, destination port,
      transport protocol}. In the case that RTP is used for the repair flows,
      the source and repair data can be multiplexed using RTP onto a single
      UDP flow and needs to be consequently demultiplexed at the receiver.
      There are various ways in which this multiplexing can be done, for
      example as described in <xref target="RFC4588"></xref>.</t>

      <t>It is important to understand that the main purpose of the FEC
      Framework architecture is to allocate functional responsibilities to
      separately documented components in such a way that specific instances
      of the components can be combined in different ways to describe
      different protocols.</t>

      <t>The FEC Framework makes use of an FEC scheme, in a similar sense to
      that defined in <xref target="RFC5052"></xref> and uses the terminology
      of that document. The FEC scheme defines the FEC encoding and decoding,
      and defines the protocol fields and procedures used to identify packet
      payload data in the context of the FEC scheme. The interface between the
      FEC Framework and an FEC scheme, which is described in this document, is
      a logical one, which exists for specification purposes only. At an
      encoder, the FEC Framework passes ADUs to the FEC scheme for FEC
      encoding. The FEC scheme returns repair symbols with their associated
      Repair FEC Payload IDs, and in some cases Source FEC Payload IDs,
      depending on the FEC scheme. At a decoder, the FEC Framework passes
      transport packet payloads (source and repair) to the FEC scheme and the
      FEC scheme returns additional recovered source packet payloads.</t>

      <t>This document defines certain FEC Framework Configuration Information
      which MUST be available to both sender and receiver(s). For example,
      this information includes the specification of the ADU flows which are
      to be FEC protected, specification of the ADU flow(s) which will carry
      the FEC protection (repair) data and the relationship(s) between these
      source and repair flows (i.e., which source flow(s) are protected by
      each repair flow(s)). The FEC Framework Configuration Information also
      includes information fields which are specific to the FEC scheme. This
      information is analogous to the FEC Object Transmission Information
      defined in <xref target="RFC5052"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The FEC Framework does not define how the FEC Framework Configuration
      Information for the stream is communicated from sender to receiver. This
      has to be defined by any CDP specification as described in the following
      sections.</t>

      <t>In this architecture we assume that the interface to the transport
      layer supports the concepts of data units (referred to here as
      Application Data Units (ADUs)) to be transported and identification of
      ADU flows on which those data units are transported. Since this is an
      interface internal to the architecture, we do not specify this interface
      explicitly. We do require that ADU flows which are distinct from the
      transport layer point of view (for example, distinct UDP flows as
      identified by the UDP source/destination addresses/ports) are also
      distinct on the interface between the transport layer and the FEC
      Framework.</t>

      <t>As noted above, RTP flows are a specific example of ADU flows which
      might be protected by the FEC Framework. From the FEC Framework point of
      view, RTP source flows are ADU flows like any other, with the RTP header
      included within the ADU.</t>

      <t>Depending on the FEC scheme, RTP can also be used as a transport for
      repair packet flows. In this case an FEC scheme has to define an RTP
      payload format for the repair data.</t>

      <t>The architecture outlined above is illustrated in the <xref
      target="architecturefigure"></xref>. In this architecture, two
      (optional) RTP instances are shown, for the source and repair data
      respectively. This is because the use of RTP for the source data is
      separate from and independent of the use of RTP for the repair data. The
      appearance of two RTP instances is more natural when one considers that
      in many FEC codes, the repair payload contains repair data calculated
      across the RTP headers of the source packets. Thus, a repair packet
      carried over RTP starts with an RTP header of its own which is followed
      (after the Repair Payload ID) by repair data containing bytes which
      protect the source RTP headers (as well as repair data for the source
      RTP payloads).</t>

      <t>The content of the transport payload for repair packets is fully
      defined by the FEC scheme. For a specific FEC scheme, a means MAY be
      defined for repair data to be carried over RTP, in which case the repair
      packet payload format starts with the RTP header. This corresponds to
      defining an RTP payload format for the specific FEC scheme.</t>

      <t>The use of RTP for repair packets is independent of the protocols
      used for source packets: if RTP is used for source packets, repair
      packets may or may not use RTP and vice versa (although it is unlikely
      that there are useful scenarios where non-RTP source flows are protected
      by RTP repair flows). FEC schemes are expected to recover entire
      transport payloads for recovered source packets in all cases. For
      example, if RTP is used for source flows, the FEC scheme is expected to
      recover the entire UDP payload, including the RTP header.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Procedural Overview">
      <section title="General">
        <t>The mechanism defined in this document does not place any
        restrictions on the ADUs which can be protected together, except that
        the ADU is carried over a supported transport protocol (See <xref
        target="TransportProtocols"></xref>). The data can be from multiple
        source flows that are protected jointly. The FEC Framework handles the
        source flows as a sequence of source blocks each consisting of a set
        of ADUs, possibly from multiple source flows which are to be protected
        together. For example, each source block can be constructed from those
        ADUs related to a particular segment in time of the flow.</t>

        <t>At the sender, the FEC Framework passes the payloads for a given
        block to the FEC scheme for FEC encoding. The FEC scheme performs the
        FEC encoding operation and returns the following information: <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>Optionally, FEC Payload IDs for each of the source payloads
            (encoded according to an FEC-Scheme-Specific format).</t>

            <t>One or more FEC repair packet payloads.</t>

            <t>FEC Payload IDs for each of the repair packet payloads (encoded
            according to an FEC-Scheme-Specific format).</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The FEC Framework then performs two operations. First, it appends
        the Source FEC Payload IDs, if provided, to each of the ADUs, and
        sends the resulting packets, known as FEC source packets, to the
        receiver, and second it places the provided FEC repair packet payloads
        and corresponding Repair FEC Payload IDs appropriately to construct
        FEC repair packets and send them to the receiver.</t>

        <t>This document does not define how the sender determines which ADUs
        are included in which source blocks or the sending order and timing of
        FEC source and repair packets. A specific CDP MAY define this mapping
        or it MAY be left as implementation dependent at the sender. However,
        a CDP specification MUST define how a receiver determines a minimum
        length of time that it needs to wait to receive FEC repair packets for
        any given source block. FEC schemes MAY define limitations on this
        mapping, such as maximum size of source blocks, but SHOULD NOT attempt
        to define specific mappings. The sequence of operations at the sender
        is described in more detail in <xref
        target="senderoperation"></xref>.</t>

        <t>At the receiver, original ADUs are recovered by the FEC Framework
        directly from any FEC source packets received simply by removing the
        Source FEC Payload ID, if present. The receiver also passes the
        contents of the received ADUs, plus their FEC Payload IDs to the FEC
        scheme for possible decoding.</t>

        <t>If any ADUs related to a given source block have been lost, then
        the FEC scheme can perform FEC decoding to recover the missing ADUs
        (assuming sufficient FEC source and repair packets related to that
        source block have been received).</t>

        <t>Note that the receiver might need to buffer received source packets
        to allow time for the FEC repair packets to arrive and FEC decoding to
        be performed before some or all of the received or recovered packets
        are passed to the application. If such a buffer is not provided, then
        the application has to be able to deal with the severe re-ordering of
        packets that can occur. However, such buffering is CDP and/or
        implementation-specific and is not specified here. The receiver
        operation is described in more detail in <xref
        target="receiveroperation"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The FEC source packets MUST contain information which identifies
        the source block and the position within the source block (in terms
        specific to the FEC scheme) occupied by the ADU. This information is
        known as the Source FEC Payload ID. The FEC scheme is responsible for
        defining and interpreting this information. This information MAY be
        encoded into a specific field within the FEC source packet format
        defined in this specification, called the Explicit Source FEC Payload
        ID field. The exact contents and format of the Explicit Source FEC
        Payload ID field are defined by the FEC schemes. Alternatively, the
        FEC scheme MAY define how the Source FEC Payload ID is derived from
        other fields within the source packets. This document defines the way
        that the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID field is appended to source
        packets to form FEC source packets.</t>

        <t>The FEC repair packets MUST contain information which identifies
        the source block and the relationship between the contained repair
        payloads and the original source block. This is known as the Repair
        FEC Payload ID. This information MUST be encoded into a specific
        field, the Repair FEC Payload ID field, the contents and format of
        which are defined by the FEC schemes.</t>

        <t>The FEC scheme MAY use different FEC Payload ID field formats for
        source and repair packets.</t>

        <t>It is assumed that the sender has constructed or received original
        data packets for the session. These could be carrying any type of
        data. The following operations, illustrated in <xref

            <t>A source block is constructed as specified in <xref
            target="sourceblock"></xref>.</t>

            <t>The source block is passed to the FEC scheme for FEC encoding.
            The Source FEC Payload ID information of each source packet is
            determined by the FEC scheme. If required by the FEC scheme the
            Source FEC Payload ID is encoded into the Explicit Source FEC
            Payload ID field.</t>

            <t>The FEC scheme performs FEC encoding, generating repair packet
            payloads from a source block and a Repair FEC Payload ID field for
            each repair payload.</t>

            <t>The Explicit Source FEC Payload IDs (if used), Repair FEC
            Payload IDs and repair packet payloads are provided back from the

            transport-layer procedures. The port(s) and multicast group(s) to
            be used for FEC repair packets are defined in the FEC Framework
            Configuration Information. The FEC source packets are sent using
            the same ADU flow identification information as would have been
            used for the original source packets if the FEC Framework were not
            present (for example, in the UDP case, the UDP source and
            destination addresses and ports on the IP datagram carrying the
            source packet will be the same whether or not the FEC Framework is
            applied).</t>

      <section anchor="receiveroperation" title="Receiver Operation">
        <t>The following describes a possible receiver algorithm, illustrated
        in <xref target="receiverfigure"></xref> and <xref
        target="receiverfigurertp"></xref> for the case of RTP repair flows,
        when receiving an FEC source or repair packet: <list style="numbers">
            <t>FEC source packets and FEC repair packets are received and
            passed to the FEC Framework. The type of packet (source or repair)
            and the source flow to which it belongs (in the case of source
            packets) is indicated by the ADU flow information which identifies
            the flow at the transport layer.<vspace blankLines="1" />In the
            special case that RTP is used for repair packets, and source and
            repair packets are multiplexed onto the same UDP flow, then RTP
            demultiplexing is required to demultiplex source and repair flows.
            However, RTP processing is applied only to the repair packets at
            this stage; source packets continue to be handled as UDP payloads
            (i.e., including their RTP headers).</t>

            <t>The FEC Framework extracts the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID
            field (if present) from the source packets and the Repair FEC
            Payload ID from the repair packets.</t>

            <t>The Explicit Source FEC Payload IDs (if present), Repair FEC
            Payload IDs, FEC source and repair payloads are passed to the FEC
            scheme.</t>

            <t>The FEC scheme uses the received FEC Payload IDs (and derived
            FEC Source Payload IDs in the case that the Explicit Source FEC
            Payload ID field is not used) to group source and repair packets
            into source blocks. If at least one source packet is missing from
            a source block, and at least one repair packet has been received
            for the same source block then FEC decoding can be performed in
            order to recover missing source payloads. The FEC scheme
            determines whether source packets have been lost and whether
            enough data for decoding of any or all of the missing source
            payloads in the source block has been received.</t>

            <t>The FEC scheme returns the ADUs to the FEC Framework in the
            form of source blocks containing received and decoded ADUs and
            indications of any ADUs which were missing and could not be
            decoded.</t>

            <t>The FEC Framework passes the received and recovered ADUs to the
            application.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The description above defines functionality responsibilities but
        does not imply a specific set of timing relationships. Source packets
        which are correctly received and those which are reconstructed MAY be
        delivered to the application out of order and in a different order
        from the order of arrival at the receiver. Alternatively, buffering
        and packet re-ordering MAY be applied to re-order received and
        reconstructed source packets into the order they were placed into the
        source block, if that is necessary according to the application.</t>

        dependent on the application. Note that some ADUs may not be included
        in any block. Each source block provided to the FEC scheme consists of
        an ordered sequence of ADUs where the following information is
        provided for each ADU: <list style="symbols">

        the payload of an original source packet. As depicted in <xref
        target="sourcepacketfigure"></xref>, it consists of the original
        packet, optionally followed by the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID
        field. The FEC scheme determines whether the Explicit Source FEC
        Payload ID field is required. This determination is specific to each
        ADU flow.</t>

        <t>The FEC source packets MUST be sent using the same ADU flow as
        would have been used for the original source packets if the FEC
        Framework were not present. The transport payload of the FEC source
        packet MUST consist of the ADU followed by the Explicit Source FEC
        Payload ID field, if required.</t>

        <t>The Explicit Source FEC Payload ID field contains information
        required to associate the source packet with a source block and for
        the operation of the FEC algorithm, and is defined by the FEC scheme.
        The format of the Source FEC Payload ID field is defined by the FEC
        scheme. In the case that the FEC scheme or CDP defines a means to
        derive the Source FEC Payload ID from other information in the packet
        (for example a sequence number used by the application protocol), then
        the Source FEC Payload ID field is not included in the packet. In this
        case, the original source packet and FEC source packet are
        identical.</t>

        <t>In applications where avoidance of IP packet fragmentation is a
        goal, CDPs SHOULD consider the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID size
        when determining the size of ADUs that will be delivered using the FEC
        Framework. This is because the addition of the Explicit Source FEC
        Payload ID increases the packet length.</t>

        <t>The Explicit Source FEC Payload ID is placed at the end of the
        packet so that in the case that Robust Header Compression (ROHC) <xref
        target="RFC3095"></xref> or other header compression mechanisms are
        used and in the case that a ROHC profile is defined for the protocol
        carried within the transport payload (for example RTP), then ROHC will
        still be applied for the FEC source packets. Applications that are
        used with this framework need to consider that FEC schemes can add
        this Explicit Source FEC Payload ID and thereby increase the packet
        size.</t>

        <t>In many applications, support for FEC is added to a pre-existing
        protocol and in this case use of the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID
        can break backwards compatibility, since source packets are
        modified.</t>

        <section title="Generic Explicit Source FEC Payload ID">
          <t>In order to apply FEC protection using multiple FEC schemes to a
          single source flow, all schemes have to use the same Explicit Source
          FEC Payload ID format. In order to enable this, it is RECOMMENDED
          that FEC schemes support the Generic Explicit Source FEC Payload ID
          format described below.</t>

          <t>The Generic Explicit Source FEC Payload ID has a length of two
          octets and consists of an unsigned packet sequence number in
          network-byte order. The allocation of sequence numbers to packets is
          independent of any FEC scheme and of the source block construction,
          except that the use of this sequence number places a constraint on
          source block construction. Source packets within a given source

      <section anchor="config" title="FEC Framework Configuration Information">
        <t>The FEC Framework Configuration Information is information that the
        FEC Framework needs in order to apply FEC protection to the ADU flows.
        A complete CDP specification that uses the framework specified here
        MUST include details of how this information is derived and
        communicated between sender and receiver.</t>

        <t>The FEC Framework Configuration Information includes identification
        of the set of source flows. For example, in the case of UDP, each
        source flow is uniquely identified by a tuple {Source IP address,
        source UDP port, destination IP address, destination UDP port}. In
        some applications some of these fields can contain wildcards, so that
        the flow is identified by a subset of the fields. In particular, in
        many applications the limited tuple {Destination IP address,
        destination UDP port} is sufficient.</t>

        <t>A single instance of the FEC Framework provides FEC protection for
        packets of the specified set of source flows, by means of one or more
        packet flows consisting of repair packets. The FEC Framework
        Configuration Information includes, for each instance of the FEC
        Framework: <list style="numbers">
            <t>Identification of the repair flows.</t>

            <t>For each source flow protected by the repair flow(s): <list
                style="letters">
                <t>Definition of the source flow.</t>

                <t>An integer identifier for this flow definition (i.e.,
                tuple). This identifier MUST be unique amongst all source
                flows that are protected by the same FEC repair flow. Integer
                identifiers can be allocated starting from zero and increasing
                by one for each flow. However, any random (but still unique)
                allocation is also possible. A source flow identifier need not
                be carried in source packets since source packets are directly
                associated with a flow by virtue of their packet headers.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>The FEC Encoding ID, identifying the FEC scheme.</t>

            <t>The length of the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID (in
            octets).</t>

            <t>Zero or more FEC-Scheme-Specific Information (FSSI) elements,
            each consisting of a name and a value where the valid element
            names and value ranges are defined by the FEC scheme.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Multiple instances of the FEC Framework, with separate and
        independent FEC Framework Configuration Information, can be present at
        a sender or receiver. A single instance of the FEC Framework protects
        packets of the source flows identified in (2) above, i.e., all packets
        sent on those flows MUST be FEC source packets as defined in <xref
        target="sourcepackets"></xref>. A single source flow can be protected
        by multiple instances of the FEC Framework.</t>

        <t>The integer flow identifier identified in (2b) above is a shorthand
        to identify source flows between the FEC Framework and the FEC scheme.
        The reason for defining this as an integer, and including it in the
        FEC Framework Configuration Information is so that the FEC scheme at
        the sender and receiver can use it to identify the source flow with
        which a recovered packet is associated. The integer flow identifier
        can therefore take the place of the complete flow description (e.g.,
        UDP 4-tuple).</t>

        <t>Whether and how this flow identifier is used is defined by the FEC
        scheme. Since repair packets can provide protection for multiple
        source flows, repair packets would either not carry the identifier at
        all or can carry multiple identifiers. However, in any case, the flow
        identifier associated with a particular source packet can be recovered
        from the repair packets as part of an FEC decoding operation.</t>

        <t>A single FEC repair flow provides repair packets for a single
        instance of the FEC Framework. Other packets MUST NOT be sent within
        this flow, i.e., all packets in the FEC repair flow MUST be FEC repair
        packets as defined in <xref target="repairpackets"></xref> and MUST
        relate to the same FEC Framework instance.</t>

        <t>In the case that RTP is used for repair packets, the identification
        of the repair packet flow can also include the RTP payload type to be
        used for repair packets.</t>

        <t>FSSI includes the information that is specific to the FEC scheme
        used by the CDP. FSSI is used to communicate the information that
        cannot be adequately represented otherwise and is essential for proper
        FEC encoding and decoding operations. The motivation behind separating
        the FSSI required only by the sender (which is carried in Sender-Side
        FEC-Scheme-Specific Information (SS-FSSI) container) from the rest of
        the FSSI is to provide the receiver or the third party entities a
        means of controlling the FEC operations at the sender. Any FSSI other
        than the one solely required by the sender MUST be communicated via
        the FSSI container.</t>

        <t>The variable-length SS-FSSI and FSSI containers transmit the
        information in textual representation and contain zero or more
        distinct elements, whose descriptions are provided by the
        fully-specified FEC schemes.</t>

        <t>For the CDPs that choose the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
        <xref target="RFC4566"></xref> as their session description protocol,
        the ABNF <xref target="RFC5234"></xref> syntax for the SS-FSSI and

        <t>In order to be used with this framework, an FEC scheme MUST be

        <t>A specification for a new FEC scheme MUST include the following:
        <list style="numbers">
            <t>The FEC Encoding ID value that uniquely identifies the FEC

            <t>A full specification of the FEC code. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />This specification MUST precisely define the
            valid FEC-Scheme-Specific Information values, the valid FEC
            Payload ID values and the valid packet payload sizes (where packet
            payload refers to the space within a packet dedicated to carrying
            encoding symbols). <vspace blankLines="1" />Furthermore, given a
            source block as defined in <xref target="sourceblock"></xref>,
            valid values of the FEC-Scheme-Specific Information, a valid
            Repair FEC Payload ID value and a valid packet payload size, the

            symbols to be included in the repair packet payload of a packet
            with the given Repair FEC Payload ID value.<vspace
            blankLines="1" />A common and simple way to specify the FEC code
            to the required level of detail is to provide a precise
            specification of an encoding algorithm which, given a source
            block, valid values of the FEC-Scheme-Specific Information, a
            valid Repair FEC Payload ID value and a valid packet payload size
            as input produces the exact value of the encoding symbols as
            output.</t>

            <t>A description of practical encoding and decoding
            algorithms.<vspace blankLines="1" />This description need not be
            to the same level of detail as for the encoding above, however it

            Payload ID.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Whenever an FEC scheme specification defines an 'encoding format'
        for an element, this has to be defined in terms of a sequence of bytes
        which can be embedded within a protocol. The length of the encoding
        format MUST either be fixed or it MUST be possible to derive the
        length from examining the encoded bytes themselves. For example, the
        initial bytes can include some kind of length indication.</t>

        independent section of larger specification (except, of course, a
        specification of one FEC scheme can include portions of another by
        reference). Where an RTP Payload Format is defined for repair data for

        be specified within the same document.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Feedback">
      <t>Many applications require some kind of feedback on transport
      performance. E.g., how much data arrived at the receiver, at what rate
      and when? When FEC is added to such applications, feedback mechanisms
      can also need to be enhanced to report on the performance of the FEC.
      E.g., how much lost data was recovered by the FEC?</t>

      <t>When used to provide instrumentation for engineering purposes, it is
      important to remember that FEC is generally applied to relatively small
      blocks of data (in the sense that each block is transmitted over a
      relatively small period of time). Thus, feedback information that is
      averaged over longer periods of time will likely not provide sufficient
      information for engineering purposes. More detailed feedback over
      shorter time scales might be preferred. For example, for applications
      using RTP transport, see <xref target="RFC5725"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Applications which used feedback for congestion control purposes MUST
      calculate such feedback on the basis of packets received before FEC
      recovery is applied. If this requirement conflicts with other uses of
      the feedback information then the application MUST be enhanced to
      support both information calculated pre- and post- FEC recovery. This is
      to ensure that congestion control mechanisms operate correctly based on
      congestion indications received from the network, rather than on
      post-FEC recovery information which would give an inaccurate picture of
      congestion conditions.</t>

      <t>New applications which require such feedback SHOULD use RTP/RTCP

      Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec_congestion" title="Congestion Control">
      <t>This section starts with some informative background on the
      motivation of the normative requirements for congestion control, which
      are spelled out in <xref target="normativecongestion"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="Motivation">
        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The enforcement of congestion control principles has gained a
            lot of momentum in the IETF over the recent years. While the need
            for congestion control over the open Internet is unquestioned, and
            the goal of TCP friendliness is generally agreed for most (but not
            all) applications, the subject of congestion detection and
            measurement in heterogeneous networks can hardly be considered as
            solved. Most congestion control algorithms detect and measure
            congestion by taking (primarily or exclusively) the packet loss
            rate into account. This appears to be inappropriate in
            environments where a large percentage of the packet losses are the
            result of link-layer errors and independent of the network
            load.</t>

            <t>The authors of this document are primarily interested in
            applications where the application reliability requirements and
            end-to-end reliability of the network differ, such that it
            warrants higher-layer protection of the packet stream, e.g., due
            to the presence of unreliable links in the end-to-end path and
            where real-time, scalability or other constraints prohibit the use
            of higher-layer (transport or application) feedback. A typical
            example for such applications is multicast and broadcast streaming
            or multimedia transmission over heterogeneous networks. In other
            cases, application reliability requirements can be so high that
            the required end-to-end reliability will be difficult to achieve.
            Furthermore, the end-to-end network reliability is not necessarily
            known in advance.</t>

            <t>This FEC Framework is not defined, nor intended, as a QoS
            enhancement tool to combat losses resulting from highly congested
            networks. It should not be used for such purposes.</t>

            <t>In order to prevent such mis-use, one approach is to leave
            standardization to bodies most concerned with the problem
            described above. However, the IETF defines base standards used by
            several bodies, including DVB, 3GPP, 3GPP2, all of which appear to
            share the environment and the problem described.</t>

            <t>Another approach is to write a clear applicability statement.
            For example, one could restrict the use of this framework to
            networks with certain loss characteristics (e.g., wireless links).
            However, there can be applications where the use of FEC is
            justified to combat congestion-induced packet losses -
            particularly in lightly loaded networks, where congestion is the
            result of relatively rare random peaks in instantaneous traffic
            load - thereby intentionally violating congestion control
            principles. One possible example for such an application could be
            a no-matter-what, brute-force FEC protection of a traffic
            generated as an emergency signal.</t>

            <t>A third approach is to require at a minimum that the use of
            this framework with any given application, in any given
            environment, does not cause congestion issues which the
            application alone would not itself cause, i.e., the use of this
            framework must not make things worse.</t>

            <t>Taking above considerations into account, <xref
            target="normativecongestion"> </xref> specifies a small set of
            constraints for the FEC, which are mandatory for all senders
            compliant with this FEC Framework. Further restrictions can be
            imposed by certain CDPs.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="normativecongestion" title="Normative Requirements">
        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The bandwidth of FEC repair data MUST NOT exceed the bandwidth
            of the original source data being protected (without the possible
            addition of an Explicit Source FEC Payload ID). This disallows the
            (static or dynamic) use of excessively strong FEC to combat high
            packet loss rates, which can otherwise be chosen by naively
            implemented dynamic FEC-strength selection mechanisms. We
            acknowledge that there are a few exotic applications, e.g., IP
            traffic from space-based senders, or senders in certain hardened
            military devices, which could warrant a higher FEC strength.
            However, in this specification we give preference to the overall
            stability and network friendliness of average applications.</t>

            <t>Whenever the source data rate is adapted due to the operation

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>First of all, it must be clear that the application of FEC protection
      to a stream does not provide any kind of security. On the opposite, the
      FEC Framework itself could be subject to attacks, or could pose new
      security risks. The goals of this section are to state the problem,
      discuss the risks and identify solutions when feasible. It also defines
      a mandatory to implement (but not mandatory to use) security scheme.</t>

      <section title="Problem Statement">
        <t>A content delivery system is potentially subject to many attacks.
        Attacks can target the content, or the CDP, or the network itself,
        with completely different consequences, in particular in terms of the
        number of impacted nodes.</t>

        <t>Attacks can have several goals: <list style="symbols">
            <t>They can try to give access to a confidential content (e.g., in
            case of a non-free content).</t>

            <t>They can try to corrupt the source flows (e.g., to prevent a
            receiver from using them), which is a form of DoS attack.</t>

            <t>They can try to compromise the receiver's behavior (e.g., by
            making the decoding of an object computationally expensive), which
            is another form of DoS attack.</t>

            <t>They can try to compromise the network's behavior (e.g., by
            causing congestion within the network), which potentially impacts
            a large number of nodes.</t>
          </list>These attacks can be launched either against the source
        and/or repair flows (e.g., by sending fake FEC source and/or repair
        packets) or against the FEC parameters that are sent either in-band
        (e.g., in the Repair FEC Payload ID or in the Explicit Source FEC
        Payload ID) or out-of-band (e.g., in the FEC Framework Configuration
        Information).</t>

        <t>Several dimensions to the problem need to be considered. The first
        one is the way the FEC Framework is used. The FEC Framework can be
        used end-to-end, i.e., it can be included in the final end-device
        where the upper application runs; or the FEC Framework can be used in
        middleboxes, for instance, to globally protect several source flows
        exchanged between two or more distant sites.</t>

        <t>A second dimension is the threat model. When the FEC Framework
        operates in the end-device, this device (e.g., a personal computer)
        might be subject to attacks. Here, the attacker is either the end-user
        (who might want to access confidential content) or somebody else. In
        all cases the attacker has access to the end-device, but not
        necessarily to the full control of the end-device (a secure domain can
        exist). Similarly, when the FEC Framework operates in a middlebox,
        this middlebox can be subject to attacks or the attacker can gain
        access to it. The threats can also concern the end-to-end transport
        (e.g., through Internet). Here, examples of threats include the
        transmission of fake FEC source or repair packets, the replay of valid
        packets, the drop, delay or misordering of packets, and of course
        traffic eavesdropping.</t>

        <t>The third dimension consists in the desired security services.
        Among them, the content integrity and sender authentication services
        are probably the most important features. We can also mention DoS
        mitigation, anti-replay protection or content confidentiality.</t>

        <t>Finally, the fourth dimension consists in the security tools
        available. This is the case of the various Digital Rights Management
        (DRM) systems, defined out of the context of the IETF and that can be
        proprietary solutions. Otherwise SRTP and IPsec/ESP are two tools that
        can turn out to be useful in the context of the FEC Framework. Note
        that using SRTP requires that the application generates RTP source
        flows and, when applied below the FEC Framework, that both the FEC
        source and repair packets to be regular RTP packets. Therefore SRTP is
        not considered as a universal solution applicable in all use
        cases.</t>

        <t>In the following sections, we further discuss security aspects
        related to the use of the FEC Framework.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Attacks Against the Data Flows">
        <t></t>

        <section title="Access to Confidential Content">
          <t>Access control to the source flow being transmitted is typically
          provided by means of encryption. This encryption can be done by the
          content provider itself, or within the application (for instance by
          using the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) <xref
          target="RFC3711"></xref>), or at the network layer, on a per-packet
          basis when IPsec/ESP is used <xref target="RFC4303"></xref>. If
          confidentiality is a concern, it is RECOMMENDED that one of these
          solutions is used. Even if we mention these attacks here, they are
          neither related to nor facilitated by the use of FEC.</t>

          <t>Note that when encryption is applied, this encryption MUST either
          be applied on the source data before the FEC protection, or if done
          after the FEC protection, then both the FEC source packets and
          repair packets MUST be encrypted (and an encryption at least as
          cryptographically secure as the encryption applied on the FEC source
          packets MUST be used for the FEC repair packets). Otherwise, if
          encryption were to be performed only on the FEC source packets after
          FEC encoding, a non-authorized receiver could be able to recover the
          source data after decoding the FEC repair packets provided that a
          sufficient number of such packets were available.</t>

          <t>The following considerations apply when choosing where to apply
          encryption (and more generally where to apply security services
          beyond encryption). Once decryption has taken place, the source data
          is in plaintext. The full path between the output of the deciphering
          module and the final destination (e.g., the TV display in case of a
          video) MUST be secured, in order to prevent any unauthorized access
          to the source data.</t>

          <t>When the FEC Framework endpoint is the end system (i.e., where
          the upper application runs) and if the threat model includes the
          possibility that an attacker has access to this end system, then the
          end system architecture is very important. More precisely, in order
          to prevent an attacker to get hold of the plaintext, all
          processings, once deciphering has taken place, MUST occur in a
          protected environment. If encryption is applied after FEC protection
          at the sending side (i.e., below FEC Framework), it means that FEC
          decoding MUST take place in the protected environment. With certain
          use cases, this MAY be complicated or even impossible. In that case
          applying encryption before FEC protection is preferred.</t>

          <t>When the FEC Framework endpoint is a middlebox, the recovered
          source flow, after FEC decoding, SHOULD NOT be sent in plaintext to
          the final destination(s) if the threat model includes the
          possibility that an attacker eavesdrops the traffic. In that case
          also it is preferred to apply encryption before FEC protection.</t>

          <t>In some cases, encryption could be applied both before and after
          the FEC protection. The considerations described above still apply
          in such cases.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="sec_content_corruption" title="Content Corruption">
          <t>Protection against corruptions (e.g., against forged FEC
          source/repair packets) is achieved by means of a content integrity
          verification/source authentication scheme. This service is usually
          provided at the packet level. In this case, after removing all the
          forged packets, the source flow might sometimes be recovered.
          Several techniques can provide this content integrity/source
          authentication service: <list style="symbols">
              <t>At the application layer, SRTP <xref target="RFC3711"></xref>
              provides several solutions to check the integrity and
              authenticate the source of RTP and RTCP messages, among other
              services. For instance, associated to the Timed Efficient Stream
              Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA) <xref
              target="RFC4383"></xref>, SRTP is an attractive solution that is
              robust to losses, provides a true authentication/integrity
              service, and does not create any prohibitive processing load or
              transmission overhead. Yet, checking a packet requires a small
              delay (a second or more) after its reception with TESLA. Whether
              this extra delay, both in terms of startup delay at the client
              and end-to-end delay, is appropriate or not depends on the
              target use case. In some situations, this might degrade the user
              experience. In other situations, this will not be an issue.
              Other building blocks can be used within SRTP to provide content
              integrity/authentication services.</t>

              <t>At the network layer, IPsec/ESP <xref
              target="RFC4303"></xref> offers (among other services) an
              integrity verification mechanism that can be used to provide
              authentication/content integrity services.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>It is up to the developer and the person in charge of deployment,
          who know the security requirements and features of the target
          application area, to define which solution is the most appropriate.
          Nonetheless it is RECOMMENDED that at least one of these techniques
          is used.</t>

          <t>Note that when integrity protection is applied, it is RECOMMENDED
          that it takes place on both FEC source and repair packets. The
          motivation is to avoid corrupted packets to be considered during
          decoding, which would often lead to a decoding failure or result in
          a corrupted decoded source flow.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Attacks Against the FEC Parameters">
        <t>Attacks on these FEC parameters can prevent the decoding of the
        associated object. For instance, modifying the finite field size of a
        Reed-Solomon FEC scheme (when applicable) will lead a receiver to
        consider a different FEC code.</t>

        <t>It is therefore RECOMMENDED that security measures are taken to
        guarantee the FEC Framework Configuration Information integrity. Since
        the FEC Framework does not define how the FEC Framework Configuration
        Information is communicated from sender to receiver, we cannot provide
        further recommendations on how to guarantee its integrity. However,
        any complete CDP specification MUST give recommendations on how to
        achieve it. When the FEC Framework Configuration Information is sent
        out-of-band, e.g., in a session description, it SHOULD be protected,
        for instance, by digitally signing it.</t>

        <t>Attacks are also possible against some FEC parameters included in
        the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID and Repair FEC Payload ID. For
        instance, modifying the Source Block Number of an FEC source or repair
        packet will lead a receiver to assign this packet to a wrong
        block.</t>

        <t>It is therefore RECOMMENDED that security measures are taken to
        guarantee the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID and Repair FEC Payload ID
        integrity. To that purpose, one of the packet-level source
        authentication/content integrity techniques of <xref
        target="sec_content_corruption"></xref> can be used.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec_pro_tog"
               title="When Several Source Flows are to be Protected Together">
        <t>When several source flows, with different security requirements,
        need to be FEC protected jointly, within a single FEC Framework
        instance, then each flow MAY be processed appropriately, before the
        protection. For instance, source Flows that require access control MAY
        be encrypted before they are FEC protected.</t>

        <t>There are also situations where the only insecure domain is the one
        over which the FEC Framework operates. In that case, this situation
        MAY be addressed at the network layer, using IPsec/ESP (see <xref
        target="sec_mandatory_solution"></xref>), even if only a subset of the
        source flows have strict security requirements.</t>

        <t>Since the use of FEC Framework should not add any additional
        threat, it is RECOMMENDED that the FEC Framework aggregate flow be in
        line with the maximum security requirements of the individual source
        flows. For instance, if denial-of-service (DoS) protection is
        required, an integrity protection SHOULD be provided below the FEC
        Framework, using for instance IPsec/ESP.</t>

        <t>Generally speaking, whenever feasible, it is RECOMMENDED to avoid
        FEC protecting flows with totally different security requirements.
        Otherwise, an important processing would be added to protect the
        source flows that do not need it.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec_mandatory_solution"
               title="Baseline Secure FEC Framework Operation">
        <t>This section describes a baseline mode of secure FEC Framework
        operation based on the application of the IPsec security protocol,
        which is one possible solution to solve or mitigate the security
        threats introduced by the use of the FEC Framework.</t>

        <t>Two related documents are of interest. First, Section 5.1 of <xref
        target="RFC5775"></xref> defines a baseline secure ALC operation for
        sender-to-group transmissions, assuming the presence of a single
        sender and a source-specific multicast (SSM) or SSM-like operation.
        The proposed solution, based on IPsec/ESP, can be used to provide a
        baseline FEC Framework secure operation, for the downstream source
        flow.</t>

        <t>Second, Section 7.1 of <xref target="RFC5740"></xref> defines a
        baseline secure NORM operation, for sender-to-group transmissions as
        well as unicast feedbacks from receivers. Here, it is also assumed
        there is a single sender. The proposed solution is also based on
        IPsec/ESP. However, the difference with respect to the first document
        relies on the management of IPsec Security Associations (SA) and
        corresponding Security Policy Database (SPD) entries, since NORM
        requires a second set of SA and SPD to be defined to protect unicast
        feedbacks from receivers.</t>

        <t>The FEC Framework has been defined in such a way to be independent
        from the application that generates source flows. Some applications
        might use purely unidirectional flows, while other applications might
        also use unicast feedbacks from the receivers. For instance, this is
        the case when considering RTP/RTCP based source flows. Depending on
        the specific situation, it is RECOMMENDED that the baseline secure FEC
        Framework operation inherits from <xref target="RFC5775"></xref> in
        case of purely unidirectional sender-to-group flows, or <xref
        target="RFC5740"></xref> in case both sender-to-group and unicast
        feedbacks flows are needed.</t>

        <t>Note that the IPsec/ESP requirements profiles outlined in <xref
        target="RFC5775"></xref> and <xref target="RFC5740"></xref> are
        commonly available on many potential hosts. They can form the basis of
        a secure mode of operation. One potential limitation, however, is the
        need for privileged user authorization. However, automated key
        management implementations are typically configured with the
        privileges necessary to affect system IPsec configuration.</t>

    <section title="Operations and Management Considerations">
      <t>The question of operating and managing the FEC Framework and the
      associated FEC scheme(s) is of high practical importance. The goals of
      this section are to discuss the general requirements, aspects related to
      a specific deployment and solutions whenever possible.</t>

      <t>In particular, this section discusses the questions of
      interoperability across vendors/use cases and whether defining mandatory
      to implement (but not mandatory to use) solutions is beneficial.</t>

      <section anchor="sec_ops1" title="What are the Key Aspects to Consider?">
        <t>Several aspects need to be considered since they will directly
        impact the way the FEC Framework and the associated FEC schemes can be
        operated and managed.</t>

        <t>This section lists them as follows:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>A Single Small Generic Component within a Larger (and Often
            Legacy) Solution: The FEC Framework is one component within a
            larger solution which includes both one or several upper-layer
            applications (that generate one or several ADU flows) and an
            underlying protocol stack. A key design principle is that the FEC
            Framework should be able to work without making any assumption
            with respect to either the upper-layer application(s) or the
            underlying protocol stack, even if there are special cases where
            assumptions are made.</t>

            <t>One-to-One with Feedback vs. One-to-Many with Feedback vs.
            One-to-Many without Feedback Scenarios: The FEC Framework can be
            used in use cases that completely differ from one another. Some
            use cases are one-way (e.g., in broadcast networks), with either a
            one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many transmission model, and
            the receiver(s) cannot send any feedback to the sender(s). Other
            use cases follow a bidirectional one-to-one, one-to-many, or
            many-to-many scenario, and the receiver(s) can send feedback to
            the sender(s).</t>

            <t>Non-FEC Framework Capable Receivers: With the one-to-many and
            many-to-many use cases, the receiver population might have
            different capabilities with respect to the FEC Framework itself
            and the supported FEC schemes. Some receivers might not be capable
            of decoding the repair packets belonging to a particular FEC
            scheme, while some other receivers might not be supporting the FEC
            Framework at all.</t>

            <t>Internet vs. non-Internet Networks: The FEC Framework can be
            useful in many use cases that use a transport network that is not
            the public Internet (e.g., with IPTV or Mobile TV). In such
            networks, the operational and management considerations can be
            achieved through an open or proprietary solution, which is
            specified outside of the IETF.</t>

            <t>Congestion Control Considerations: See <xref
            target="sec_congestion"></xref> for a discussion on whether
            congestion control is needed or not, and its relationships with
            the FEC Framework.</t>

            <t>Within End-Systems vs. within Middleboxes: The FEC Framework
            can be used within end-systems, very close to the upper-layer
            application, or within dedicated middleboxes, for instance when it
            is desired to protect one or several flows while they cross a
            lossy channel between two or more remote sites.</t>

            <t>Protecting a Single Flow vs. Several Flows Globally: The FEC
            Framework can be used to protect a single flow, or several flows
            globally.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Operational and Management Recommendations">
        <t>Overall, from the discussion of <xref target="sec_ops1"></xref>, it
        is clear that the CDPs and FEC schemes compatible with the FEC
        Framework widely differ in their capabilities, application and
        deployment scenarios such that a common operation and management
        method or protocol that works well for all of them would be too
        complex to define. Thus, as a design choice, the FEC Framework does
        not dictate the use of any particular technology or protocol for
        transporting FEC data, managing the hosts, signaling the configuration
        information or encoding the configuration information. This provides
        flexibility and is one of the main goals of the FEC Framework.
        However, this section gives some RECOMMENDED guidelines.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>A Single Small Generic Component within a Larger (and Often
            Legacy) Solution: It is anticipated that the FEC Framework will
            often be used to protect one or several RTP streams. Therefore,
            implementations SHOULD make feedback information accessible via
            RTCP to enable users to take advantage of the tools using (or used
            by) RTCP to operate and manage the FEC Framework instance along
            with the associated FEC schemes.</t>

            <t>One-to-One with Feedback vs. One-to-Many with Feedback vs.
            One-to-Many without Feedback Scenarios: With use cases that are
            one-way, the FEC Framework sender does not have any way to gather
            feedback from receivers. With use cases that are bidirectional,
            the FEC Framework sender can collect detailed feedback (e.g., in
            case of a one-to-one scenario) or at least occasional feedback
            (e.g., in case of a multicast, one-to-many scenario). All these
            applications have naturally different operational and management
            aspects. If any, they also have different requirements or features
            for collecting feedback, processing it and acting on it. The data
            structures for carrying the feedback also vary.<vspace
            blankLines="1" />Implementers SHOULD make feedback available using
            either an in-band or out-of-band asynchronous reporting mechanism.
            When an out-of-band solution is preferred, a standardized
            reporting mechanism, such as Syslog <xref target="RFC5424"></xref>
            or SNMP notifications <xref target="RFC3411"></xref>, is
            RECOMMENDED. When required, a mapping mechanism between the Syslog
            and SNMP reporting mechanisms could be used, as described in <xref
            target="RFC5675"></xref> and <xref target="RFC5676"></xref>. </t>

            <t>Non-FEC Framework Capable Receivers: <xref
            target="sourcepackets"></xref> gives recommendations on how to
            provide backward compatibility in presence of receivers that
            cannot support the FEC scheme being used, or the FEC Framework
            itself: basically the use of Explicit Source FEC Payload ID is
            banned. Additionally, a non-FEC Framework capable receiver MUST
            also have a means not to receive the repair packets that it will
            not be able to decode in the first place or a means to identify
            and discard them appropriately upon receiving them. This SHOULD be
            achieved by sending repair packets on a different transport-layer
            flow. In case of RTP transport and if both source and repair
            packets will be sent on the same transport-layer flow, this SHOULD
            be achieved by using an RTP framing for FEC repair packets with a
            different payload type. It is the responsibility of the sender to
            select the appropriate mechanism when needed.</t>

            <t>Within End-Systems vs. within Middleboxes: When the FEC
            Framework is used within middleboxes, it is RECOMMENDED that the
            paths between the hosts where the sending applications run and the
            middlebox that performs FEC encoding be as reliable as possible,
            i.e., are not prone to packet loss, packet reordering, or varying
            delays in delivering packets. <vspace blankLines="1" />Similarly,
            it is RECOMMENDED that the paths between the middleboxes that
            perform FEC decoding and the end-systems where the receiving
            applications operate, in situations where this is a different
            host, be as reliable as possible. <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t>Management of Communication Issues Before Reaching the Sending
            FECFRAME Instance:
            Let us consider situations where the FEC Framework is used within
            middleboxes.
            At the sending side, the general reliability recommendation for
            the path between the sending applications and the middlebox is
            important but it may not guarantee that a loss, reordering or
            important delivery delay cannot happen, for whatever reason. If
            such a rare event happens, this event SHOULD NOT compromise the
            operation of the FECFRAME instances, neither at the sending side nor
            receiving side. This is particularly important with FEC schemes
            that do not modify the ADU for backward compatibility purposes
            (i.e., do not use any Explicit Source FEC Payload ID) and rely for
            instance on the RTP sequence number field to identify FEC source
            packets within their source block. In this case, packet loss or
            packet reordering leads to a gap in the RTP sequence number space
            seen by the FECFRAME instance. Similarly, varying delay in
            delivering packets over this path can lead to significant timing
            issues. With FEC schemes that indicate in the Repair FEC Payload
            ID, for each source block, the base RTP sequence number and number
            of consecutive RTP packets that belong to this source block, a
            missing ADU or an ADU delivered out of order could cause the
            FECFRAME sender to switch to a new source block. However, some FEC
            schemes and/or receivers may not necessarily handle such varying
            source block sizes. In this case, one could consider duplicating
            the last ADU received before the loss, or inserting zero'ed
            ADU(s), depending on the ADU flow nature. Implementers SHOULD
            consider the consequences of such alternative approaches based on
            their use cases.</t>

            <t>Protecting a Single Flow vs. Several Flows Globally: In the
            general case, the various ADU flows that are globally protected
            can have different features, and in particular different real-time
            requirements (in case of real-time flows). The process of globally
            protecting these flows SHOULD take into account the requirements
            of each individual flow. In particular, it would be
            counter-productive to add repair traffic to a real-time flow for
            which the FEC decoding delay at a receiver makes decoded ADUs for
            this flow useless because they do not satisfy the associated
            real-time constraints. From a practical point of view, this means
            that the source block creation process at the sending FEC
            Framework instance, SHOULD consider the most stringent real-time
            requirements of the ADU flows being globally protected.</t>

            <t>ADU Flow Bundle Definition and Flow Delivery: By design a
            repair flow might enable a receiver to recover the ADU flow(s)
            that it protects even if none of the associated FEC source packets
            are received. Therefore, when defining the bundle of ADU flows
            that are globally protected and when defining which receiver
            receives which flow, the sender SHOULD make sure that the ADU
            flow(s) and repair flow(s) of that bundle will only be received by
            receivers that are authorized to receive all the ADU flows of that
            bundle. See <xref target="sec_pro_tog"></xref> for additional
            recommendations for situations where a strict access control to
            ADU flows is needed. <vspace blankLines="1" />Additionally when
            multiple ADU flows are globally protected, a receiver who wants to
            benefit from FECFRAME loss protection SHOULD receive all the ADU
            flows of the bundle. Otherwise, the missing FEC source packets
            would be considered as lost which might significantly reduce the
            efficiency of the FEC scheme.</t>

    <section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>FEC schemes for use with this framework are identified in protocols
      using FEC Encoding IDs. Values of FEC Encoding IDs are subject to IANA
      registration. For this purposes, this document creates a new registry
      called FEC Framework (FECFRAME) FEC Encoding IDs.</t>

      <t>The values that can be assigned within the FEC Framework (FECFRAME)
      FEC Encoding ID registry are numeric indexes in the range (0, 255).
      Values of 0 and 255 are reserved. Assignment requests are granted on an
      IETF Consensus basis as defined in <xref target="RFC5226"></xref>. <xref
      target="fecscheme"></xref> defines explicit requirements that documents
      defining new FEC Encoding IDs should meet.</t>

<t>
This document describes a fully-specified simple FEC scheme for LDPC-Staircase codes
that can be used to protect media streams along the lines defined by the FECFRAME framework.
<!-- These codes belong to the well-known class of "Low Density Parity Check" codes. -->
These codes have many interesting properties: 
they are systematic codes, they perform close to ideal codes in many use-cases and they also
feature very high encoding and decoding throughputs.
LDPC-Staircase codes are therefore a good solution to protect a single high bitrate source
flow, or to protect globally several mid-rate flows within a single FECFRAME instance.
They are also a good solution whenever the processing load of a software encoder or
decoder must be kept to a minimum.

		<section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
		<!-- =========================================== -->

<t>The use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes is a classic solution to improve the reliability
of unicast, multicast and broadcast Content Delivery Protocols (CDP) and applications
<xref target="RFC3453"/>.
The <xref target="RFC6363"/> document describes a generic framework to use FEC schemes
with media delivery applications, and for instance with real-time streaming media applications based
on the RTP real-time protocol.
Similarly the <xref target="RFC5052"/> document describes a generic framework to use FEC schemes
with with objects (e.g., files) delivery applications based on the ALC  <xref target="RFC5775"/>
and NORM <xref target="RFC5740"/> reliable multicast transport protocols.
</t>

<t>More specifically, the <xref target="RFC5053"/> (Raptor) and <xref target="RFC5170"/> (LDPC-Staircase
and LDPC-Triangle) FEC schemes introduce erasure codes based on sparse parity check matrices for object
delivery protocols like ALC and NORM.
Similarly, the <xref target="RFC5510"/> document introduces Reed-Solomon codes based on Vandermonde
matrices for the same object delivery protocols.
All these codes are systematic codes, meaning that the k source symbols are part of the n encoding symbols.
Additionally, the Reed-Solomon FEC codes belong to the class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes that
are optimal in terms of erasure recovery capabilities.
It means that a receiver can recover the k source symbols from any set of exactly k encoding symbols out of n.
This is not the case with either Raptor or LDPC-Staircase codes, and these codes require a certain
number of encoding symbols in excess to k.
However, this number is small in practice when an appropriate decoding scheme is used at the
receiver <xref target="Cunche08"/>.
Another key difference is the high encoding/decoding complexity of Reed-Solomon codecs compared to
Raptor or LDPC-Staircase codes.
A difference of one or more orders of magnitude or more in terms of encoding/decoding speed exists between
the Reed-Solomon and LDPC-Staircase software codecs <xref target="Cunche08"/><xref target="CunchePHD10"/>.
Finally, Raptor and LDPC-Staircase codes are large block FEC codes, in the sense of <xref target="RFC3453"/>,
since they can efficiently deal with a large number of source symbols. 
</t>

<t>
The present document focuses on LDPC-Staircase codes, that belong to the well-known class of
"Low Density Parity Check" codes.
Because of their key features, these codes are a good solution in many situations, as detailed
in <xref target="OperationsManagement"/>.
<!--
to protect a single high bitrate source
flow as in <xref target="Matsuzono10"/>, or to protect globally several mid-rate source flows within a single
FECFRAME instance.
They are also a good solution whenever processing requirements at a software encoder or decoder must be
kept to a minimum, independently of the ADU flow(s) bitrate.
-->
</t>

<t>
This documents inherits from <xref target="RFC5170"/> the specifications of the core LDPC-Staircase codes.
Therefore this document specifies only the information specific to the FECFRAME context and
refers to <xref target="RFC5170"/> for the core specifications of the codes.
To that purpose, the present document introduces:

	<t> the Fully-Specified FEC Scheme with FEC Encoding ID XXX that specifies a simple way 
	of using LDPC-Staircase codes in order to protect arbitrary ADU flows. </t>

Finally, publicly available reference implementations of these codes are available <xref target="LDPC-codec"/>

<section anchor="CommonProcedures" title="Common Procedures Related to the ADU Block and

<!-- ================ -->
<t>
This section introduces the procedures that are used during the ADU block and the related
source block creation, for the FEC scheme considered.
</t>

	<section anchor="Requirements" title="Restrictions">
	<!-- ==================================== -->

<t>
This specification has the following restrictions:
<list style="symbols">
	<t> there MUST be exactly one source symbol per ADUI, and therefore per ADU;</t>
	<t> there MUST be exactly one repair symbol per FEC Repair Packet;</t>
	<t> there MUST be exactly one source block per ADU block;</t>
	<t> the use of the LDPC-Staircase scheme is such that there MUST be exactly one encoding symbol per group,
		i.e., G MUST be equal to 1 <xref target="RFC5170"/>;</t>
</list>
</t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="CommonProc_problem" title="ADU Block Creation">
	<!-- ==================================== -->

<t>
Two kinds of limitations MUST be considered, that impact the ADU block creation:
<list style="symbols">
<t> at the FEC Scheme level: the FEC Scheme and the FEC codec have limitations that
	define a maximum source block size;</t>
<t> at the FECFRAME instance level: the target use-case MAY have real-time constraints
	that MAY define a maximum ADU block size;</t>
</list>
Note that terminology "maximum source block size" and "maximum ADU block size"
depends on the point of view that is adopted (FEC Scheme versus FECFRAME instance).
However, in this document, both refer to the same value since <xref target="Requirements"/>
requires there is exactly one source symbol per ADU.
We now detail each of these aspects.
</t>

<t>
The maximum source block size in symbols, max_k, depends on several parameters:
the code rate (CR), the Encoding Symbol ID (ESI) field length in the Explicit
Source/Repair FEC Payload ID (16 bits), as well as possible internal codec limitations.

More specifically, max_k cannot be larger than the following values, derived
from the ESI field size limitation, for a given code rate:
      <list style="empty">
        <t>max1_k = 2^^(16 - ceil(Log2(1/CR)))</t>
      </list> 
Some common max1_k values are:
<list style="symbols">
        <t>CR == 1 (no repair symbol): max1_k = 2^^16 = 65536 symbols</t>
        <t>1/2 &le; CR &lt; 1: max1_k = 2^^15 = 32,768 symbols</t>
        <t>1/4 &le; CR &lt; 1/2: max1_k = 2^^14 = 16,384 symbols</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>Additionally, a codec MAY impose other limitations on the maximum source
block size, for instance, because of a limited working memory size.
This decision MUST be clarified at implementation time, when the target
use-case is known. This results in a max2_k limitation.</t>

<t> 
Then, max_k is given by: 
      <list style="empty">
        <t>max_k = min(max1_k, max2_k)</t>
      </list>
Note that this calculation is only required at the encoder (sender), since the
actual k parameter (k &le; max_k) is communicated to the decoder (receiver) through 
the Explicit Source/Repair FEC Payload ID.
</t>

<t>
The source ADU flows MAY have real-time constraints. 
In that case the maximum number of ADUs of an ADU block must not exceed a certain
threshold since it directly impacts the decoding delay.
The larger the ADU block size, the longer a decoder may have to wait until it has received
a sufficient number of encoding symbols for decoding to succeed, and therefore
the larger the decoding delay.
When the target use-case is known, these real-time constraints result in an upper bound to
the ADU block size, max_rt.
</t>

<t>
For instance, if the use-case specifies a maximum decoding latency, l, and if each
source ADU covers a duration d of a continuous media (we assume here the simple case
of a constant bit rate ADU flow), then the ADU block size must not exceed:
	<list style="empty">
	<t>max_rt = floor(l / d)</t>
	</list>
After encoding, this block will produce a set of at most n = max_rt / CR encoding symbols.
These n encoding symbols will have to be sent at a rate of n / l packets per second.
For instance, with d = 10 ms, l = 1 s, max_rt = 100 ADUs.
</t>

<t>
If we take into account all these constraints, we find:
      <list style="empty">
	<t>max_B = min(max_k, max_rt)</t>
      </list>
This max_B parameter is an upper bound to the number of ADUs that can constitute an ADU block.
</t>

	</section>


	<section anchor="CommonProc_src_block_creation"
		title="Source Block Creation">
	<!-- ==================================== -->


<t>
In its most general form the FECFRAME framework and the LDPC-Staircase FEC scheme
are meant to protect a set of independent flows.
Since the flows have no relationship to one another, the ADU size of each
flow can potentially vary significantly.
Even in the special case of a single flow, the ADU sizes can largely
vary (e.g., the various frames of a "Group of Pictures (GOP) of an H.264 flow).
This diversity must be addressed since the LDPC-Staircase FEC scheme requires a constant
encoding symbol size (E parameter) per source block.
Since this specification requires that there is only one source symbol per ADU,
E must be large enough to contain all the ADUs of an ADU block along
with their prepended 3 bytes (see below).
</t>

<t>
In situations where E is determined per source block
(default, specified by the FFCI/FSSI with S = 0, <xref target="RSover2mArbitraryFlows_fssi"/>),
E is equal to the size of the largest ADU of this source block plus three (for the
prepended 3 bytes, see below).
In this case, upon receiving the first FEC Repair Packet for this source block,
since this packet MUST contain a single repair symbol (<xref target="RSover2mArbitraryFlows_repair_fpi"/>),
a receiver determines the E parameter used for this source block.
</t>

<t>
In situations where E is fixed 
(specified by the FFCI/FSSI with S = 1, <xref target="RSover2mArbitraryFlows_fssi"/>),
then E must be greater or equal to the size of the largest ADU of this source block
plus three (for the prepended 3 bytes, see below).
If this is not the case, an error is returned.
How to handle this error is use-case specific (e.g., a larger E parameter may be 
communicated to the receivers in an updated FFCI message, using an appropriate
mechanism) and is not considered by this specification.
</t>

<t>
The ADU block is always encoded as a single source block.
There are a total of B &le; max_B ADUs in this ADU block.
For the ADU i, with 0 &le; i &le; B-1, 3 bytes are prepended
(<xref target="fig_src_block_creation_global_enc"/>):
<list style="symbols">
	<t>The first byte, FID[i] (Flow ID), contains the integer identifier
		associated to the source ADU flow to which this ADU
		belongs to.
		It is assumed that a single byte is sufficient, or said
		differently, that no more than 256 flows will be protected by
		a single instance of the FECFRAME framework.
</t>	
	<t>The following two bytes, L[i] (Length), contain the length of this
		ADU, in network byte order (i.e., big endian).
		This length is for the ADU itself and does not include the 
		FID[i], L[i], or Pad[i] fields.
	</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
Then zero padding is added to ADU i (if needed) in field Pad[i], for alignment purposes
up to a size of exactly E bytes.
The data unit resulting from the ADU i and the F[i], L[i] and Pad[i] fields, is called
ADU Information (or ADUI).
Each ADUI contributes to exactly one source symbol to the source block.

<t>
Note that neither the initial 3 bytes nor the optional padding
are sent over the network.
However, they are considered during FEC encoding.
It means that a receiver who lost a certain FEC source packet (e.g., the
UDP datagram containing this FEC source packet) will be able to recover the ADUI
if FEC decoding succeeds.
Thanks to the initial 3 bytes, this receiver will get rid of the padding (if any)
and identify the corresponding ADU flow.

The FEC Framework document <xref target="RFC6363"/> provides a comprehensive

Therefore the present section follows the security considerations section of
<xref target="RFC6363"/> and only discusses topics that are specific

considerations to the way this solution is applied (e.g., before versus after

</t>

	</section>

  </section>

  <section title="Attacks Against the FEC Parameters">
  <!-- ================ -->

<t>
The FEC Scheme specified in this document defines parameters that
can be the basis of several attacks.
More specifically, the following parameters of the FFCI may be modified
by an attacker (<xref target="RSover2mArbitraryFlows_fssi"/>):
<list style="symbols">
	<t>FEC Encoding ID:
	changing this parameter leads the receiver to consider a different
	FEC Scheme, which enables an attacker to create a Denial of Service (DoS).
	</t>
	<t>Encoding symbol length (E):
	setting this E parameter to a value smaller than the valid one enables
	an attacker to create a DoS since the repair symbols and certain source
	symbols will be larger than E, which is an incoherency for the receiver.
	Setting this E parameter to a value larger than the valid one has
	similar impacts when S=1 since the received repair symbol size will be
	smaller than expected. On the opposite it will not lead to any incoherency
	when S=0 since the actual symbol length value for the block is determined
	by the size of any received repair symbol, as long as this value is smaller
	than E.
	However setting this E parameter to a larger value may have impacts on
	receivers that pre-allocate memory space in advance to store incoming
	symbols.
	</t>
	<t>Strict (S) flag:
	flipping this S flag from 0 to 1 (i.e., E is now considered as
	a strict value) enables an attacker to mislead the receiver if the
	actual symbol size varies over different source blocks.
	Flipping this S flag from 1 to 0 has no major consequences unless the
	receiver requires to have a fixed E value (e.g., because the receiver
	pre-allocates memory space).
	</t>
	<t>
	N1 minus 3 (n1m3):
	changing this parameter leads the receiver to consider a different
	code, which enables an attacker to create a DoS.
	</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
It is therefore RECOMMENDED that security measures are taken to
guarantee the FFCI integrity, as specified in <xref target="RFC6363"/>.
How to achieve this depends on the way the FFCI is communicated from the sender
to the receiver, which is not specified in this document.
</t>

<t>
Similarly, attacks are possible against the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID
and Repair FEC Payload ID: by modifying the Source Block Number (SBN), or the
Encoding Symbol ID (ESI), or the Source Block Length (k), or the Number Encoding Symbols (n),
an attacker can easily corrupt the block identified by the SBN. 
Other consequences, that are use-case and/or CDP dependant, may also happen.
It is therefore RECOMMENDED that security measures are taken to guarantee the
FEC Source and Repair Packets as stated in <xref target="RFC6363"/>.

<section anchor="OperationsManagement" title="Operations and Management Considerations">
<!-- ==================================== -->

<t>
The FEC Framework document <xref target="RFC6363"/> provides a comprehensive
analysis of operations and management considerations applicable to FEC schemes.
Therefore the present section only discusses topics that are specific to the use of
LDPC-Staircase codes as specified in this document.
</t>


    <section title="Operational Recommendations">
    <!-- ================ -->

<t>
LDPC-Staircase codes have excellent erasure recovery capabilities with
large source blocks, close to ideal MDS codes.
For instance, independently of FECFRAME, with source block size k=1024, CR=2/3, N1=5, G=1, with a hybrid
ITerative/Maximum Likelihood (IT/ML) decoding approach (see below) and when all symbols
are sent in a random order (see below), the average overhead
amounts to 0.64% (corresponding to 6.5 symbols in addition to k) and receiving
1046 symbols (corresponding to a 2.1% overhead) is sufficient to reduce the decoding
failure probability to 5.9*10^^-5.
This is why these codes are a good solution to protect a
single high bitrate source flow as in <xref target="Matsuzono10"/>,
or to protect globally several mid-rate source flows within a single FECFRAME
instance: in both cases the source block size can be assumed to be equal to a few
hundreds (or more) source symbols.
</t>

<t>
LDPC-Staircase codes are also a good solution whenever processing
requirements at a software encoder or decoder must be kept to a minimum.
This is true when the decoder uses an IT decoding algorithm,
or an ML algorithm (we use a Gaussian Elimination as the ML algorithm) when
this latter is carefully implemented and the source block size kept reasonable,
or a mixture of both techniques which is the recommended solution
<xref target="Cunche08"/><xref target="CunchePHD10"/>.
For instance an average decoding speed between 1.3 Gbps (corresponding to a very
bad channel, close to the theoretical decoding limit and requiring an ML decoding)
and 4.3 Gbps (corresponding to a medium quality channel where IT decoding is sufficient)
are easily achieved with a source block size composed of k=1024 source symbols,
a code rate CR=2/3 (i.e., 512 repair symbols), 1024 byte long symbols, G=1, and N1=5,
on an Intel Xeon 5120/1.86GHz workstation running Linux/64 bits.
Additionally, with a hybrid IT/ML approach, a receiver can decide if and when
ML decoding is used, depending on local criteria (e.g., battery or CPU
capabilities), independently from other receivers.
</t>

<t>
As the source block size decreases, the erasure recovery capabilities
of LDPC codes in general also decrease.
In the case of LDPC-Staircase codes, in order to compensate this phenomenon,
it is recommended to increase the N1 parameter (e.g., experiments carried
out in <xref target="Matsuzono10"/> use N1=7 if k=170 symbols, and N1=5 otherwise)
and to use a hybrid IT/ML decoding approach.
For instance, independently of FECFRAME, with a small source block size k=256 symbols, CR=2/3, N1=7, and G=1,
8he average overhead amounts to 0.71% (corresponding to 1.8 symbols in addition to k),
and receiving 271 symbols (corresponding to a 5.9% overhead)
is sufficient to reduce the decoding failure probability to 5.9*10^^-5.
Using N1=9 or 10 further improves these results if need be, which also enables
to use LDPC-Staircase codes with k=100 symbols for instance.
</t>

<t>
With very small source blocks (e.g., a few tens symbols), using for instance
Reed-Solomon codes <xref target="SIMPLE_RS"/> or 2D parity check codes
MAY be more appropriate.
</t>

<t>
The way the FEC Repair Packets are transmitted is of high importance.
A good strategy, that works well for any kind of channel loss model, consists
in sending FEC Repair Packets in random order (rather than in sequence) while
FEC Source Packets are sent first and in sequence.
Sending all packets in a random order is another possibility, but it requires
that all repair symbols for a source block be produced first, which adds some
extra delay at a sender.

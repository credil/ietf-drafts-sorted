Abstract

   This memo splits message submission from message relay, allowing each
   service to operate according to its own rules (for security, policy,
   etc.), and specifies what actions are to be taken by a submission
   server.

   Message relay is unaffected, and continues to use SMTP [SMTP-MTA]
   over port 25.

   When conforming to this document, message submission uses the
   protocol specified here, normally over port 587.

   This separation of function offers a number of benefits, including
   the ability to apply specific security or policy requirements.

Internet-Draft         Message Submission for Mail              May 2011


1.  Introduction

   SMTP was defined as a message *transfer* protocol, that is, a means
   to route (if needed) and deliver finished (complete) messages.

   Message Transfer Agents (MTAs) are not supposed to alter the message
   text, except to add 'Received', 'Return-Path', and other header
   fields as required by [SMTP-MTA].  However, SMTP is now also widely
   used as a message *submission* protocol, that is, a means for Message
   User Agents (MUAs) to introduce new messages into the MTA routing
   network.  The process that accepts message submissions from MUAs is
   termed a Message Submission Agent (MSA).

   In order to permit unconstrained communications, SMTP is not often
   authenticated during message relay.

   Authentication and authorization of initial submissions have become
   increasingly important, driven by changes in security requirements
   and rising expectations that submission servers take responsibility
   for the message traffic they originate.

   For example, due to the prevalence of machines that have worms,
   viruses, or other malicious software that generate large amounts of
   spam, many sites now prohibit outbound traffic on the standard SMTP
   port (port 25), funneling all mail submissions through submission
   servers.

   In addition to authentication and authorization issues, messages
   being submitted are in some cases finished (complete) messages, and
   in other cases are unfinished (incomplete) in one or more aspects.
   Unfinished messages may need to be completed to ensure they conform
   to the Message Format specification [MESSAGE-FORMAT], and related
   requirements.  For example, the message may lack a proper 'Date'
   header field, and domains might not be fully qualified.  In some
   cases, the MUA may be unable to generate finished messages (e.g., it
   might not know its time zone).  Even when submitted messages are
   complete, local site policy may dictate that the message text be
   examined or modified in some way, e.g., to conceal local name or
   address spaces.  Such completions or modifications have been shown to
   cause harm when performed by downstream MTAs -- that is, MTAs after
   the first-hop submission MTA -- and are in general considered to be
   outside the province of standardized MTA functionality.

   Separating messages into submissions and transfers allows developers
   and network administrators to more easily do the following:

   o  Implement security policies and guard against unauthorized mail
      relaying or injection of unsolicited bulk mail

Internet-Draft         Message Submission for Mail              May 2011


   o  Implement authenticated submission, including off-site submission
      by authorized users such as travelers

   o  Separate the relevant software code differences, thereby making
      each code base more straightforward and allowing for different
      programs for relay and submission

   o  Detect configuration problems with a site's mail clients

   o  Provide a basis for adding enhanced submission services in the
      future

   This memo describes a low-cost, deterministic means for messages to
   be identified as submissions, and specifies what actions are to be
   taken by a submission server.

1.1.  Discussion List

   [[anchor3: RFC Editor: Please remove this section before
   publication.]]

   This document is being discussed in the IETF YAM Working Group.

1.2.  Note to IESG and/or Document Shepherd

   [[anchor5: RFC Editor: Please remove this section before
   publication.]]

   RFC 4409 was published in April 2006, so the "time in place"
   requirement of RFC 2026 has been satisfied.

   Message Submission on port 587 has seen significant deployment over
   the past 8-10 years, becoming widespread in the past 2-3 years.
   There are several reasons for this, such as decisions by many ISPs
   and organizations in general to block outbound port 25 (except by
   their own border MTAs), and consequently to support 587 with
   authentication, as well as recognition of the need to apply different
   policies to submission and relay.

   The effort required to reissue and process this document is justified
   by the need to update and clarify several references and by
   additional clarifying text to support email internationalization
   work.

2.1.  Definitions of Terms Used in This Memo

   Many of the concepts and terms used in this document are defined in
   [SMTP-MTA]; familiarity with those documents is assumed here.

   Fully-Qualified

   Containing or consisting of a domain that can be globally resolved
   using the Domain Name Service; that is, not a local alias or partial
   specification.

   Message Submission Agent (MSA)

   A process that conforms to this specification.  An MSA acts as a
   submission server to accept messages from MUAs, and either delivers
   them or acts as an SMTP client to relay them to an MTA.

   Message Transfer Agent (MTA)

   A process that conforms to [SMTP-MTA].  An MTA acts as an SMTP server
   to accept messages from an MSA or another MTA, and either delivers
   them or acts as an SMTP client to relay them to another MTA.

   Message User Agent (MUA)

   A process that acts (often on behalf of a user and with a user
   interface) to compose and submit new messages, and process delivered
   messages.

   For delivered messages, the receiving MUA may obtain and process the
   message according to local conventions or, in what is commonly
   referred to as a split-MUA model, Post Office Protocol [POP3] or IMAP
   [IMAP4] is used to access delivered messages, whereas the protocol
   defined here (or SMTP) is used to submit messages.

2.2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   In examples, "C:" is used to indicate lines sent by the client, and
   "S:" indicates those sent by the server.  Line breaks within a
   command example are for editorial purposes only.

   Examples use the 'example.net' domain.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
   in this document are to be interpreted as defined in [KEYWORDS].

3.  Message Submission

3.1.  Submission Identification

   Port 587 is reserved for email message submission as specified in
   this document.  Messages received on this port are defined to be
   submissions.  The protocol used is ESMTP [SMTP-MTA], with additional
   restrictions or allowances as specified here.

   Although most email clients and servers can be configured to use port
   587 instead of 25, there are cases where this is not possible or
   convenient.  A site MAY choose to use port 25 for message submission,
   by designating some hosts to be MSAs and others to be MTAs.

3.2.  Message Rejection and Bouncing

   MTAs and MSAs MAY implement message rejection rules that rely in part
   on whether the message is a submission or a relay.

   For example, some sites might configure their MTAs to reject all RCPT
   commands for messages that do not reference local users, and
   configure their MSA to reject all message submissions that do not
   come from authorized users, with authorization based either on
   authenticated identity or the submitting endpoint being within a
   protected IP environment.

   NOTE: It is better to reject a message than to risk sending one that
   is damaged.  This is especially true for problems that are
   correctable by the MUA, for example, an invalid 'From' field.

   If an MSA is not able to determine a return path to the submitting
   user, from a valid MAIL FROM, a valid source IP address, or based on
   authenticated identity, then the MSA SHOULD immediately reject the
   message.  A message can be immediately rejected by returning a 550
   code to the MAIL command.

   Note that a null return path, that is, MAIL FROM:<>, is permitted and
   MUST NOT in itself be cause for rejecting a message.  (MUAs need to
   generate null return-path messages for a variety of reasons,
   including disposition notifications.)

   Except in the case where the MSA is unable to determine a valid
   return path for the message being submitted, text in this
   specification that instructs an MSA to issue a rejection code MAY be
   complied with by accepting the message and subsequently generating a
   bounce message.  (That is, if the MSA is going to reject a message
   for any reason except being unable to determine a return path, it can
   optionally do an immediate rejection or accept the message and then

   mail a bounce.)

   NOTE: In the normal case of message submission, immediately rejecting
   the message is preferred, as it gives the user and MUA direct
   feedback.  To properly handle delayed bounces, the client MUA needs
   to maintain a queue of messages it has submitted, and match bounces
   to them.  Note that many contemporary MUAs do not have this
   capability.

3.3.  Authorized Submission

   Numerous methods have been used to ensure that only authorized users
   are able to submit messages.  These methods include authenticated
   SMTP, IP address restrictions, secure IP and other tunnels, and prior
   POP authentication.

   Authenticated SMTP [SMTP-AUTH] has seen widespread deployment.  It
   allows the MSA to determine an authorization identity for the message
   submission, one that is not tied to other protocols.

   IP address restrictions are very widely implemented, but do not allow
   for travelers and similar situations, and can be easily spoofed
   unless all transport paths between the MUA and MSA are trustworthy.

   Secure IP [IPSEC], and other encrypted and authenticated tunneling
   techniques, can also be used and provide additional benefits of
   protection against eavesdropping and traffic analysis.

   Requiring a POP [POP3] authentication (from the same IP address)
   within some amount of time (e.g., 20 minutes) prior to the start of a
   message submission session has also been used, but this does impose
   restrictions on clients as well as servers, which may cause
   difficulties.  Specifically, the client must do a POP authentication
   before an SMTP submission session, and not all clients are capable
   and configured for this.  Also, the MSA must coordinate with the POP
   server, which may be difficult.  There is also a window during which
   an unauthorized user can submit messages and appear to be a
   previously authorized user.  Since it is dependent on the MUA's IP
   addresses, this technique is substantially as subject to IP address
   spoofing as validation based on known IP addresses alone (see above).


4.  Mandatory Actions

   An MSA MUST do all of the following:

Internet-Draft         Message Submission for Mail              May 2011


4.1.  General Submission Rejection Code

   Unless covered by a more precise response code, response code 554 is
   to be used to reject a MAIL, RCPT, or DATA command that contains
   something improper.

4.2.  Ensure All Domains Are Fully-Qualified

   The MSA MUST ensure that all domains in the SMTP envelope are fully-
   qualified.

   If the MSA examines or alters the message text in any way, except to
   add trace header fields [SMTP-MTA], it MUST ensure that all domains
   in address header fields are fully-qualified.

   Reply code 554 is to be used to reject a MAIL, RCPT, or DATA command
   that contains improper domain references.

   A frequent local convention is to accept single-level domains (e.g.,
   'sales') and then to expand the reference by adding the remaining
   portion of the domain name (e.g., to 'sales.example.net').  Local
   conventions that permit single-level domains SHOULD reject, rather
   than expand, incomplete multi-level domains (e.g., 'squeaky.sales'),
   since such expansion is particularly risky.

4.3.  Require Authentication

   The MSA MUST by default issue an error response to the MAIL command
   if the session has not been authenticated using [SMTP-AUTH], unless
   it has already independently established authentication or
   authorization (such as being within a protected subnetwork).

   Section 3.3 discusses authentication mechanisms.

   Reply code 530 [SMTP-AUTH] is used for this purpose.


5.  Recommended Actions

   The MSA SHOULD do all of the following:

5.1.  Enforce Address Syntax

   An MSA SHOULD reject messages with illegal syntax in a sender or
   recipient SMTP envelope address.

   If the MSA examines or alters the message text in way, except to add
   trace header fields, it SHOULD reject messages with illegal address

Internet-Draft         Message Submission for Mail              May 2011


   syntax in address header fields.

   Reply code 501 is to be used to reject a MAIL or RCPT command that
   contains a detectably improper address.

   When addresses are resolved after submission of the message body,
   reply code 554 (with a suitable enhanced status code from
   [SMTP-CODES]) is used after end-of-data, if the message contains
   invalid addresses in the header.

5.2.  Log Errors

   The MSA SHOULD log message errors, especially apparent
   misconfigurations of client software.

   It can be very helpful to notify the administrator when problems are
   detected with local mail clients.  This is another advantage of
   distinguishing submission from relay: system administrators might be
   interested in local configuration problems, but not in client
   problems at other sites.

   Note that it is important to impose limits on such logging to prevent
   certain forms of denial of service (DoS) attacks.

5.3.  Apply Shorter Timeouts

   The timeouts specified in Section 4.5.3.2 of RFC 5321 [SMTP-MTA] are
   designed to deal with the many types of situations that can be
   encountered on the public Internet.  The relationship among clients
   and servers corresponding to this specification is typically much
   closer and more predictable.  Submission clients behave differently
   from relay client in some areas, especially tolerance for time- outs.
   In practice, message submission clients tend to have short time-outs
   (perhaps 2-5 minutes for a reply to any command).  Submission servers
   SHOULD respond to any command (even DATA) in fewer than 2 minutes.


6.  Optional Actions

   The MSA MAY do any of the following:

6.1.  Enforce Submission Rights

   The MSA MAY issue an error response to a MAIL command if the address
   in MAIL FROM appears to have insufficient submission rights, or is
   not authorized with the authentication used (if the session has been
   authenticated).

   Reply code 550 with an appropriate enhanced status code per
   [SMTP-CODES], such as 5.7.1, is used for this purpose.

6.2.  Enforce Permissions

   The MSA MAY issue an error response to a RCPT command if inconsistent
   with the permissions given to the user (if the session has been
   authenticated).

   Reply code 550 with an appropriate enhanced status code per
   [SMTP-CODES], such as 5.7.1, is used for this purpose.

6.3.  Check Message Data

   The MSA MAY issue an error response to the DATA command or send a
   failure result after end-of-data if the submitted message is
   syntactically invalid, or seems inconsistent with permissions given
   to the user (if known), or violates site policy in some way.

   Reply code 554 is used for syntactic problems in the data.  Reply
   code 501 is used if the command itself is not syntactically valid.
   Reply code 550 with an appropriate enhanced status code per
   [SMTP-CODES] (such as 5.7.1) is used to reject based on the
   submitting user.  Reply code 550 with an appropriate enhanced status
   code (such as 5.7.0) is used if the message violates site policy.

6.4.  Support for the Postmaster Address

   If appropriate under local conditions and to facilitate conformance
   with the "postmaster" requirements of [SMTP-MTA], the MSA MAY permit
   a reduced degree of authentication for mail addressed to the
   "postmaster" (or one of its alternate spelling forms, see
   [SMTP-MTA]), in one or more domains, as compared to requirements
   enforced for other addresses.  Among other benefits, this provides an
   address of last resort that can be used by authorized users to report
   problems that otherwise prevent them from submitting mail.

6.5.  Adjust Character Encodings

   Subject to limits imposed by other protocols and specifications, the
   MSA MAY convert among character sets or string encodings to improve
   message usefulness, likelihood of delivery, or conformance with other
   specifications or recommendations.  Such conversions MAY include,
   when necessary, replacement of addresses whose encoding does not
   conform to RFC 5321 with ones that do, using information available
   out of band.

7.  Interaction with SMTP Extensions

   The following table lists standards-track and Experimental SMTP
   extensions whose documents do not explicitly specify their
   applicability to this protocol.  Listed are the EHLO keyword, name,
   an indication as to the use of the extension on the submit port, and
   a reference:

   Future SMTP extensions SHOULD explicitly specify if they are valid on
   the Submission port.

   Some SMTP extensions are especially useful for message submission:

Internet-Draft         Message Submission for Mail              May 2011


   Extended Status Codes [SMTP-CODES] SHOULD be supported and used
   according to [CODES-EXTENSION].  This permits the MSA to notify the
   client of specific configuration or other problems in more detail
   than the response codes listed in this memo.  Because some rejections
   are related to a site's security policy, care should be used not to
   expose more detail to unauthenticated senders than is needed

   [PIPELINING] SHOULD be supported by the MSA.

   [SMTP-AUTH] allows the MSA to validate the authority and determine
   the identity of the submitting user and MUST be supported by the MSA.

   Any references to the DATA command in this memo also refer to any
   substitutes for DATA, such as the BDAT command used with [CHUNKING].


8.  Message Modifications

   Sites MAY modify submissions to ensure compliance with standards and
   site policy.  This section describes a number of such modifications
   that are often considered useful.

   NOTE: As a matter of guidance for local decisions to implement
   message modification, a paramount rule is to limit such actions to
   remedies for specific problems that have clear solutions.  This is
   especially true with address elements.  For example, indiscriminately
   appending a domain to an address or element that lacks one typically
   results in more broken addresses.  An unqualified address must be
   verified to be a valid local part in the domain before the domain can
   be safely added.

   Any message forwarded or delivered by the MSA MUST conform to the
   requirements of [SMTP-MTA] and [MESSAGE-FORMAT] or the requirements
   permited by extensions that are supported by the MSA and accepted by
   the next-hop server.

   If an incoming message includes a DKIM [RFC4871][RFC5672], PGP
   [RFC4880], S/MIME [RFC5751], or other signature, sites SHOULD
   consider what effect message modifications will have on the validity
   of the signature, and MAY use the presence or absence of a signature
   as a criterion when deciding what, if any, modifications to make.

8.1.  Add 'Sender'

   The MSA MAY add or replace the 'Sender' field, if the identity of the
   sender is known and this is not given in the 'From' field.

   The MSA MUST ensure that any address it places in a 'Sender' field is

Internet-Draft         Message Submission for Mail              May 2011


   in fact a valid mail address.

8.2.  Add 'Date'

   The MSA MAY add a 'Date' field to the submitted message, if it lacks
   it, or correct the 'Date' field if it does not conform to
   [MESSAGE-FORMAT] syntax.

8.3.  Add 'Message-ID'

   The MSA SHOULD add or replace the 'Message-ID' field, if it lacks it,
   or it is not valid syntax (as defined by [MESSAGE-FORMAT]).  Note
   that a number of clients still do not generate Message-ID fields.

8.4.  Transfer Encode

   The MSA MAY apply transfer encoding to the message according to MIME
   conventions, if needed and not harmful to the MIME type.

8.5.  Sign the Message

   The MSA MAY (digitally) sign or otherwise add authentication
   information to the message.

8.6.  Encrypt the Message

   The MSA MAY encrypt the message for transport to reflect
   organizational policies.

   NOTE: To be useful, the addition of a signature and/or encryption by
   the MSA generally implies that the connection between the MUA and MSA
   must itself be secured in some other way, for example, by operating
   inside of a secure environment, by securing the submission connection
   at the transport layer, or by using an [SMTP-AUTH] mechanism that
   provides for session integrity.

8.7.  Resolve Aliases

   The MSA MAY resolve aliases (CNAME records) for domain names, in the
   SMTP envelope and optionally in address fields of the header, subject
   to local policy.

   NOTE: Unconditionally resolving aliases could be harmful.  For
   example, if www.example.net and ftp.example.net are both aliases for
   mail.example.net, rewriting them could lose useful information.

Internet-Draft         Message Submission for Mail              May 2011


8.8.  Header Rewriting

   The MSA MAY rewrite local parts and/or domains in the SMTP envelope,
   and optionally in address fields of the header, according to local
   policy.  For example, a site may prefer to rewrite 'JRU' as
   'J.Random.User' in order to hide login names, and/or to rewrite
   'squeaky.sales.example.net' as 'zyx.example.net' to hide machine
   names and make it easier to move users.

   However, only addresses, local-parts, or domains which match specific
   local MSA configuration settings should be altered.  It would be very
   dangerous for the MSA to apply data-independent rewriting rules, such
   as always deleting the first element of a domain name.  So, for
   example, a rule that strips the left-most element of the domain, if
   the complete domain matches '*.foo.example.net', would be acceptable.

   The MSA MUST NOT rewrite a forward-pointing (destination) address in
   a way that violates the constraints of [SMTP-MTA] on modifications of
   local-parts.  Addressing and encoding changes carried out in
   conjunction with the action of Section 6.5 do not violate this
   principle if the MSA has sufficient information available to
   successfully and accurately apply the substitution.


9.  Security Considerations

   Separation of submission and relay of messages allows a site to
   implement different policies for the two types of services, including
   requiring use of additional security mechanisms for one or both.  It
   can do this in a way which is simpler, both technically and
   administratively.  This increases the likelihood that policies will
   be applied correctly.

   Separation also can aid in tracking and preventing unsolicited bulk
   email.

   For example, a site could configure its mail servers such that the
   MSA requires authentication before accepting a message, and the MTA
   rejects all RCPT commands for non-local users.  This can be an
   important element in a site's total email security policy.

   If a site fails to require any form of authorization for message
   submissions (see Section 3.3 for discussion), it is allowing open use
   of its resources and name; unsolicited bulk email can be injected
   using its facilities.

   Section 3 includes further discussion of issues with some
   authentication methods.

   Section 5.2 includes a cautionary note that unlimited logging can
   enable certain forms of denial of service attacks.


10.  IANA Considerations

   The table in Table 1 has been corrected (reference for NO-SOLICITING)
   and extended (ATRN, DELIVERBY, CONPEM, and CONNEG).  The registry
   should be updated to reflect the changed and new entries.  Entries in
   the registry that do not appear in the table above are correct and
   should not be altered.

   "has been updated" after this change is made.]]


11.  Acknowledgments

   The preparation and development of the current version of this
   specification was stimulated by discussions in the IETF YAM and EAI
   Working Groups.

   Nathaniel Borenstein and Barry Leiba were instrumental in the
   development of this update to RFC 2476.

   The original memo (RFC 2476) was developed in part based on comments
   and discussions which took place on and off the IETF-Submit mailing
   list.  The help of those who took the time to review that document
   and make suggestions is appreciated, especially that of Dave Crocker,
   Ned Freed, Keith Moore, John Myers, and Chris Newman.

Appendix A.  Major Changes from RFC 4409

   The protocol specified by this document is not substantively
   different from that of RFC 4409.  However, the present specification
   contains several clarifications and updates to reflect changes and
   revisions to other documents subsequent to the publication of RFC
   4409.  The following specific changes may be of interest to some
   readers.

   o  Updated several references to reflect more recent versions of the
      various specifications.  As part of this, reclassified RFC 4954 to
      a normative reference (SMTP AUTH is a MUST for 4409 and this
      specification).

   o  Updated the text in Section 7 to reflect the existence and partial
      population of the registry and the included table (Table 1) to
      correct one entry and add others.  See Section 10 for more
      information.

   o  Added new text (Section 5.3 to clarify that Submission Servers
      should respond quickly.

   o  Added text to make it explicit that character encoding changes are
      permitted.

   o  Added text to make it clear that modifications to signed messages
      may cause problems and that they should be carefully considered.


Appendix B.  Note on References

   RFC 4897 statement/ disclaimer follows. [[anchor37: RFC Editor:
   please seek advice from the IESG as to whether the statement should
   be removed for publication.]]

   RFCs 4954, 5321, and 5322 are not Full Standards, so their use in
   citations from this document are downward references.  The protocols
   that they describe are widely-deployed, interoperable, stable, and
   successful, so the references are justified.


Appendix C.  Change Log

   RFC Editor: Please remove this Section

C.1.  Changes between RFC 4409 and version-00 of this document

   This subsection identifies changes from RFC 4409 to the first posted
   version of this document that are of an editorial or procedural
   nature insufficient to justify inclusion in Appendix A or that may
   need clarification for the WG.

   o  Changed reference identifiers in 4409 that started with numbers to
      other forms.  Xml2rfc doesn't like leading numbers.

   o  Added an RFC 4897 downgrade statement as an appendix just in case
      this goes through on a three-step standards process.

   o  Started on upgrade of Acknowledgments section.

   o  Added clarifying language to the first part and last paragraph of
      Section 8 to be sure that no one thinks the use of an MSA prevents
      the use of SMTP extensions that extend various permitted
      properties of messages, or that address rewriting to make message
      syntax conform to RFC 5321 (or whatever is permitted at the next
      hop) is prohibited.

2.4.  Proposed Changes

   The YAM WG proposes making the following changes in a revision:

   item:  [PLACEHOLDER: INSERT TEXT HERE]

2.5.  Non-Changes

   The YAM WG discussed and chose not to make the following changes:

   1.  [PLACEHOLDER: INSERT TEXT HERE]

2.6.  Downward references

   At Full Standard, the following references would be downward
   references:

      [PLACEHOLDER: INSERT TEXT HERE]

2.7.  IESG Feedback

   The YAM WG requests feedback from the IESG on this decision.  In
   particular:

   o  Does the IESG believe the proposed changes are suitable during a
      move from Draft to Full Standard?

   o  Excluding the previous proposed changes and expected IESG support
      for technically substantive IETF last call feedback, does the IESG
      believe any additional changes are critical to advance this
      document from draft to full standard?  If so, please provide
      sufficient information so the WG can address these issues prior to
      IETF last call or determine that the document is inappropriate for
      the YAM WG to process at this time.

   o  Does the IESG consider the downward references acceptable for a
      full standard?  If not, please cite which specific downward
      reference or references are problematic and why so the WG can
      address these issues prior to IETF last call or determine the
      document is inappropriate for the YAM WG to process at this time.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains no IANA actions.

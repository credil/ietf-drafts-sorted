Abstract

   This document provides detailed call flows for the scenarios
   documented in the Centralized Conferencing (XCON) Framework and the
   XCON Scenarios.  The call flows document the use of the interface
   between a conference control client and a conference control server
   using the Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol (CCMP).  The
   objective is to provide a base reference for both protocol
   researchers and developers.

Internet-Draft           CCMP Call Flow Examples           December 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document provides detailed call flows for the scenarios
   documented in the Framework for Centralized Conferencing (XCON
   Framework) [RFC5239] and the XCON Scenarios [RFC4597].  The XCON
   scenarios describe a broad range of use cases taking advantage of the
   advanced conferencing capabilities provided by a system realization
   of the XCON framework.  The call flows document the use of the
   interface between a conference control client and a conference
   control server using the Centralized Conferencing Manipulation
   Protocol (CCMP)[I-D.ietf-xcon-ccmp].

   Due to the broad range of functionality provided by the XCON
   Framework and the flexibility of the CCMP messaging, these call flows
   should not be considered inclusive of all the functionality that can
   provided by the XCON Framework and protocol implementations.  These
   flows represent a sample to provide an overview of the feature rich
   capabilities of the XCON framework and CCMP messaging for protocol
   developers, software developers and researchers.


2.  Conventions

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and indicate requirement
   levels for compliant implementations.  In this document, these key
   words are used when describing normative functionality based on the
   XCON Framework and CCMP.

   Note that due to RFC formatting conventions, this document often
   splits message details whose content would exceed 72 characters.  A
   backslash character marks where this line folding has taken place.
   This backslash and its trailing CRLF and whitespace would not appear
   in the actual protocol contents.


3.  Terminology

   This document uses the same terminology as found in the referenced
   documents, with the following terms and abbreviations used in the
   call flows.  Also, note that the term "call flows" is used in a very
   generic sense in this document since the media is not limited to
   voice.  The calls supported by the XCON framework and CCMP can
   consist of media such as text, voice and video, including multiple
   media types in a single active conference.

   Conferencing and Media Client Client (CMCC):  As defined in the XCON
      Framework.  In the flows in this document, the CMCC is logically
      equivalent to the use of UAC as the client notation in the media
      control call flows [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-call-flows].


   Conferencing Server (ConfS):  As defined in the XCON Framework.  In
      this document, the conferencing server is used interchangeably
      with the term Application Server (AS) as used in the Media Control
      Architectural Framework [RFC5567].  However, these need not be the
      same entities in an implementation.


   Media Server (MS):  As defined in the Media Control Architectural
      Framework [RFC5567].


4.  Overview

   This document provides a sampling of detailed call flows that can be
   implemented based on a system realization of [RFC5239] and
   implementation of [I-D.ietf-xcon-ccmp].  This is intended to be a
   simple guide on the use of the conference control protocol between
   the Conference Server and the Conference Control Client.  The
   objective is to provide an informational base reference for protocol
   developers, software developers and researchers.

   This document focuses on the interaction between the Conference (and
   Media) Control Client and the Conferencing system, specifically the
   Conference Server.  The scenarios are based on those described in the
   XCON framework, many of which are based on the advanced conferencing
   capabilities described in the XCON scenarios.  Additional scenarios
   have been added to provide examples of other real life scenarios that
   are anticipated to be supported by the framework.  With the exception
   of an initial example with media control messaging, the examples do
   not include the details for the media control
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-mixer-control-package], call signaling or binary
   floor control [RFC4582] protocols.  This document references the
   scenarios in the Media Control call flows
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-call-flows], SIP Call Control Conferencing
   [RFC4579] and binary floor control protocol documents.


5.  Conference Creation

   This section provides the details associated with the various ways in
   which a conference can be created using CCMP and the XCON framework
   constructs.  As previously mentioned the details of the media

   control, call signaling and floor control protocols, where
   applicable, are annotated in the flows without showing all the
   details.  However, for clarification purposes, the first example
   Section 5.1 provides the details of the media control messaging along
   with an example of the standard annotation used throughout the
   remainder of this document.  In subsequent flows, only this
   annotation (identified by lower case letters) is included and the
   reader is encouraged to refer to the call flows in the relevant
   documents for details for the other protocols.  The annotations for
   the call signaling are on the left side of the conferencing server
   vertical bar and those for the media control messaging are on the
   right side.

5.1.  Basic Conference Creation

   The simplest manner in which a conference can be created is
   accomplished by the client sending a "confRequest" message with the
   "create" operation as the only parameter to the conference server,
   together with the "confUserID" associated with the requesting client
   itself.  This results in the creation of a default conference, with
   an XCON-URI in the form of the "confObjID" parameter, the XCON-UserID
   in the form of the "confUserID" parameter (the same already present
   in the request) and the data for the conference object in the
   "confInfo" parameter all returned in the "confResponse" message.
   According to the implementation of the framework, this example may
   also add the user that invoked the conference upon creation to the
   conference object (e.g., "method" attribute in the "target" element
   of "allowed-users-list" may be set to "dial out" for this client
   based on the particular conferencing systems default).  This is
   exactly the case depicted in the figure, which is presented to enrich
   the scenario.  Note that, depending upon the conferencing system,
   this default conference could be specific to the client requesting
   the conference and thus may be different for the initiator than other
   participants (e.g., IVR interactions in this case which are not
   shown).

   The specific data for the conference object is returned in the
   "confResponse" message in the "confInfo" parameter.  This allows the
   client (with the appropriate authorization) to manipulate this data
   and add additional participants to the conference, as well as change
   the data during the conference.  In addition, the client may
   distribute the conferencing information to other participants
   allowing them to join, the details of which are provided in
   additional flows.  Please notice that, according to CCMP
   specification, the restitution of the new conference data in the
   "confInfo" parameter is not mandatory: if the "confInfo" parameter of
   the successful confResponse/create is void, a following confRequest/
   retrieve of the returned "confObjID" can be triggered to provide the

   requesting client with the detailed conference description.

   Clients that are not XCON-aware may join the conference using a
   specific signaling interface such as SIP [RFC3261], using the
   signaling interface to the conference focus as described in
   [RFC4579].  However, these details are not shown in the message
   flows.  The message flows in this document identity the point in the
   message flows at which this signaling occurs via the lower case
   letter items (i.e., (a)...(x)) along with the appropriate text for
   the processing done by the conferencing server.

5.2.  Basic Conference Creation for a specific instance of Conference
      Information

   A conference can also be created by the client sending a
   "confRequest" message with the "create" operation, along with the
   desired data in the form of the "confInfo" parameter for the
   conference to be created.  The request also includes the "confUserID"
   of the requesting entity.  If the conferencing system can support
   that specific type of conference (capabilities, etc.), then the
   request results in the creation of a conference.  In this success
   case, an XCON-URI in the form of the "confObjID" parameter and the
   XCON-UserID in the form of the "confUserID" parameter (again, the
   same as the requesting entity) are returned in the "confResponse"
   message.  In this example, we choose not to return the created
   conference object in the successful "confResponse" in the "confInfo"
   parameter.

   This example also activates the conference upon creation (i.e.,
   "method" attribute is set to "dial out" for this client based on the
   particular conferencing systems default).  Just as before, this is
   not to be considered mandatory, since it depends on the
   implementation choices of the framework.  Note that, depending upon
   the conferencing system, this default conference could be specific to

           Figure 5: Create Basic Conference Detailed Messaging

5.3.  Basic Conference Creation - Cloning an existing Conference

   A client can also create another conference by cloning an existing
   conference, such as an active conference or conference reservation.
   In this example, the client sends a "confRequest" message with the
   "create" operation, along with the "confUserID" and a specific
   "confObjID", from which a new conference is to be created by cloning
   an existing conference.

   An example of how a client can create a conference based on a
   blueprint is provided in Section 5.4.  The manner by which a client
   in this example might learn about a conference reservation or active
   conferences is similar to the first step in the blueprint example,
   with the exception of specifying querying for different types of
   conference objects supported by the specific conferencing system.
   For example, in this example, the client clones a conference
   reservation (i.e., an inactive conference).

   If the conferencing system can support a new instance of the specific
   type of conference(capabilities, etc.), then the request results in
   the creation of a conference, with an XCON-URI in the form of a new
   value in the "confObjID" parameter to reflect the newly cloned
   conference object returned in the "confResponse" message.

                 Figure 6: Create Basic Conference - Clone

   1.  "Alice" sends a confRequest message to clone a conference based
       on an existing conference reservation.  "Alice" indicates this
       conference should be cloned from the specified parent conference
       represented by the "confObjID" in the request.

   2.  Upon receipt of the confRequest message containing a "create"
       operation and "confObjID", the conferencing system ensures that
       the "confObjID" received is valid.  The conferencing system
       determines the appropriate read/write access of any users to be
       added to a conference based on this "confObjID" (using
       membership, roles, etc.).  The conferencing system uses the
       received "confObjID" to clone a conference reservation.  The
       conferencing system also reserves or allocates a new "confObjID"
       (called "confObjID*" in Figure 6) to be used for the cloned
       conference object.  This new identifier is of course different
       from the one associated with the conference to be cloned, since
       it represents a different conference object.  Any subsequent
       protocol requests from any of the members of the conference must
       address this new identifier.  The conferencing system maintains
       the mapping between this conference ID and the parent conference

       object ID associated with the reservation through the conference
       instance, and this mapping is explicitly addressed through the
       "cloning-parent" element of the "conference-description" in the
       new conference object.

         Figure 8: Client Creation of Conference using Blueprints

   1.  "Alice" first sends a "blueprintsRequest" message to the
       conferencing system identified by the conference server discovery
       process.  Upon receipt of the "blueprintsRequest", the
       conferencing system would first authenticate "Alice" and then
       ensure that "Alice" has the appropriate authority based on system
       policies to receive any blueprints supported by that system.

   2.  Any blueprint that "Alice" is authorized to use are returned in a
       "blueprintsResponse" message in the "blueprintsInfo" attribute.

   3.  Upon receipt of the "blueprintsResponse" containing the
       blueprints, "Alice" determines which blueprint to use for the
       conference to be created.  "Alice" sends a "blueprintRequest"
       message to get the specific blueprint as identified by the
       "confObjID".

   4.  The conferencing system returns the "confInfo" associated with
       the specific blueprint as identified by the 'confObjID' in the
       "blueprintResponse" message.

   5.  "Alice" then sends a "confRequest" with a "create" operation to
       the conferencing system to create a conference reservation,
       including the appropriate "blueprintName" and associated
       "confObjID".

   6.  Upon receipt of the "confRequest" message with a "create"
       operation, the conferencing system uses the received blueprint to
       clone a conference, allocating a new "confObjID" (again called
       "confObjID* in the example).  The conferencing server then sends
       a "confResponse" message including the new "confObjID*"
       associated with the newly created conference instance.  Upon
       receipt of the "confResponse" message, "Alice" can now add other
       users to the conference .

6.  General Conference scenarios and examples

   The following scenarios are based on those documented in the XCON
   framework.  The examples assume that a conference has already been
   correctly established, with media, if applicable, per one of the
   examples in Section 5.

6.1.  Conference Announcements and Recordings

   In this example, as shown in Figure 10 "Alice" is joining "Bob"'s
   conference that requires that she first enter a pass code.  After
   successfully entering the passcode, an announcement prompts "Alice to
   speak her name so it can be recorded.  When "Alice" is added to the
   active conference, the recording is played back to all the existing
   participants.  A very similar example is presented in Figure 33 of
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-call-flows].

                  Figure 10: Recording and Announcements

   1.  Upon receipt of the userRequest from "Alice" to be added to
       "Bob's" conference (i.e., an "update" operation on "Bob's"
       conference object), the conferencing system determines that a
       password is required for this specific conference.  Thus an
       announcement asking "Alice" to enter the password is provided to
       "Alice".  This may be achieved by means of typical IVR
       fucntionality.  Once "Alice" enters the password, it is validated
       against the policies associated with "Bob's" active conference.
       The conferencing system then connects to a server which prompts
       and records "Alice's" name.  The conferencing system must also
       determine whether "Alice" is already a user of this conferencing
       system or whether she is a new user.  In this case, "Alice" is a
       new user for this conferencing system, so a conference user
       identifier is created for "Alice".  Based upon the addressing
       information provided by "Alice", the call signaling to add
       "Alice" to the conference is instigated through the Focus.

   2.  The conference server sends "Alice" a userResponse message which
       includes the "confUserID" assigned by the conferencing system for
       "Alice".  This would allow "Alice" to later perform operations on
       the conference (if she were to have the appropriate policies),
       including registering for event notifications associated with the
       conference.  Once the call signaling indicates that "Alice" has
       been successfully added to the specific conference, per updates
       to the state, and depending upon the policies, other participants
       (e.g., "Bob") are notified of the addition of "Alice" to the
       conference via the conference notification service and an
       announcement is provided to all the participants indicating that
       "Alice" has joined the conference.

6.2.  Monitoring for DTMF

   The conferencing system also needs the capability to monitor for DTMF
   from each individual participant.  This would typically be used to
   enter the identifier and/or access code for joining a specific
   conference.

   An example of DTMF monitoring, within the context of the framework
   elements, is shown in Figure 10.  A typical way for the conferencing
   system to be aware of all the DTMF interactions within the context of
   conferences it is responsible for, is making use of the MEDIACTRL
   architecture for what regards media manipulation.  Examples in that
   sense (specifically for what concerns DTMF interception in conference

6.3.  Adding a Party

   In this example, "Alice" wants to add "Bob" to an established
   conference.  In the following example we assume "Bob" is a new user
   to the system, which means "Alice" also needs to provide details
   about him.  In fact, the case of "Bob" already present as a user in
   the conferencing system is much easier to address, and will be
   discussed later on.

   1.  "Alice" sends a userRequest message with an operation of "create"
       to add "Bob" to the specific conference as identified by the
       confObjID.  The "create" operation also makes sure that "Bob" is
       created as a user in the whole conferencing system.  This is done
       by adding a "userInfo" element describing "Bob" as a user.  This
       is needed in order to let the conferencing system be aware of
       "Bob"'s characteristics.  In case Bob was already a registered
       user, "Alice" would just have referenced him through his XCON
       UserID, without providing the additional "userInfo".  In fact,
       that information (including, for instance, "Bob"'s SIP URI to be
       used subsequently for dial-out) would be obtained by referencing
       the extant registration.  The conference server ensures that
       "Alice" has the appropriate authority based on the policies
       associated with that specific conference object to perform the
       operation.  As mentioned before, a new Conference User Identifier
       is created for Bob, and the "userInfo" is used to update the
       conference object accordingly.

   2.  In the presented example, the call signaling to add "Bob" to the
       conference is instigated through the Focus as well.  Please
       notice that this is implementation specific.  In fact, a
       conferencing system may accomplish different actions after the
       user creation, just as it may do nothing at all.  Among the
       possible actions, for instance "Bob" may be added as a "target"
       element to the "allowed-users-list" element, whose joining
       "method" may be either "dial-in" or "dial-out".  Besides, out-of-
       band notification mechanisms may be involved as well, e.g. to
       notify "Bob" via mail of the new conference, including details as
       the date, password, expected participants and so on.

      To conclude the overview on this scenario, once "Bob" has been
      successfully added to the specified conference, per updates to the
      state, and depending upon the policies, other participants
      (including "Bob" himself) may be notified of the addition of "Bob"
      to the conference via the Conference Notification Service.

6.4.  Muting a Party

   This section provides an example of the muting of a party in an
   active conference.  The unmuting would involve the identical CCMP
   message flow.  Although, in the case that floor control is involved,
   whether or not a particular conference client can unmute itself must
   be considered by the conferencing system.

      Please notice that interaction between CCMP and floor control
      should be carefully considered.  In fact, handling CCMP- and BFCP-
      based media control has to be considered as multiple layers: i.e.,
      a participant may have the BFCP floor granted, but be muted by
      means of CCMP.  If so, he would still be muted in the conference,
      and would only be unmuted if both the protocols allowed for this.

   Figure 14 provides an example of one client "Alice" impacting the
   media state of another client "Bob".  This example assumes an
   established conference.  In this example, the client, "Alice" whose
   Role is "moderator" of the conference, wants to mute "Bob" on a
   medium-size multi-party conference, as his device is not muted (and
   he's obviously not listening to the call) and background noise in his
   office environment is disruptive to the conference.  BFCP floor
   control is assumed not to be involved.

6.5.  Internal Sidebar

   Figure 16 provides an example of one client "Alice" involved in
   active conference with "Bob" and "Carol".  "Alice" wants to create a
   sidebar to have a side discussion with "Bob" while still viewing the
   video associated with the main conference.  Alternatively, the audio
   from the main conference could be maintained at a reduced volume.
   "Alice" initiates the sidebar by sending a request to the
   conferencing system to create a conference reservation based upon the
   active conference object.  "Alice" and "Bob" would remain on the
   roster of the main conference, such that other participants could be
   aware of their participation in the main conference, while an
   internal-sidebar conference is occurring.  Besides, "Bob" decides
   that he is not interested in still receiving the conference audio in
   background (not even at a lower volume as "Alice" configured) and so
   modifies the sidebar in order to make that stream inactive for him.

            Figure 16: Client Creation of a Sidebar Conference

   1.  Upon receipt of CCMP sidebarByValRequest message to "reserve" a
       new sidebar conference based upon the confObjID received in the
       request, the conferencing system uses the confObjID to clone a
       conference reservation for the sidebar.  The sidebar reservation
       is NOT independent of the active conference (i.e., parent).  The
       conferencing system also reserves or allocates a new confObjID to
       be used for any subsequent protocol requests from any of the
       members of the conference.

   2.  The relationship information is provided in the
       sidebarByValResponse message, specifically in the "sidebar-
       parent" element.  A dump of the complete representation of the
       main/parent conference is provided below as well to show how the
       cloning process for the creation of the sidebar could take place.

   3.  Upon receipt of the sidebarByValResponse message to reserve the
       conference, "Alice" can now create an active conference using
       that reservation, or create additional reservations based upon

       the existing reservations.  In this example, "Alice" wants only
       "Bob" to be involved in the sidebar, thus she manipulates the
       membership so that only the two of them appear in the "allowed-
       users-list" section.  "Alice" also wants both audio and the video
       from the original conference to be available in the sidebar.  For
       what concerns the media belonging to the sidebar itself, "Alice"
       wants the audio to be restricted to the participants in the
       sidebar (that is, her and "Bob").  Additionally, "Alice"
       manipulates the media values to recieve the audio from the main
       conference at a reduced volume, so that the communication between
       her and "Bob" isn't affected.  "Alice" sends a
       sidebarByValRequest message with an operation of "update" along
       with the sidebarByValInfo in the reservation, to create an active
       conference.

   4.  Upon receipt of the sidebarByValRequest to update the reservation
       to create an active conference for the sidebar, as identified by
       the sidebar conference object ID, the conference server ensures
       that "Alice" has the appropriate authority based on the policies
       associated with that specific conference object to perform the
       operation.  The conference server must also validate the updated
       information in the reservation, ensuring that a member like "Bob"
       is already a user of this conference server.  Once the data for
       the confObjID is updated, the conference server sends a
       sidebarByValResponse to "Alice".  Depending upon the policies,
       the initiator of the request (i.e., "Alice") and the participants
       in the sidebar (i.e., "Bob") may be notified of his addition to
       the sidebar via the conference notification service.

   5.  At this point, "Bob" sends a userRequest message to the
       conference server with an operation of "update" to completely
       disable the background audio from the parent conference, since it
       prevents him from understanding what "Alice" says in the sidebar.

   6.  Notice that "Bob's" request only changes the media perspective
       for "Bob".  "Alice" keeps on receiving both the audio from "Bob"
       and the background from the parent conference.  This request may
       be relayed by the conference server to the Media Server handling
       the mixing, if present.  Upon completion of the change, the
       conference server sends a "userResponse" message to "Bob".
       Depending upon the policies, the initiator of the request (i.e.,
       "Bob") and the participants in the sidebar (i.e., "Alice") may be
       notified of this change via the conference notification service.

   That said, let's consider the following conference object:

   This is the representation of the conference the sidebar is going to
   be created in.  As such, it will be used by the conferencing system
   in order to create the new conference object associated with the
   sidebar.  In fact, the sidebar creation happens through a cloning of
   the parent conference.  Once the sidebar is created, an "update"
   makes sure that the sidebar is customized as needed.  The following
   protocol dump makes the process clearer.

               Figure 17: Internal Sidebar Messaging Details

6.6.  External Sidebar

   Figure 18 provides an example of a different approach towards
   sidebar.  In this scenario, one client, "Alice", is involved in an
   active conference with "Bob", "Carol", "David" and "Ethel".  "Alice"
   gets an important text message via a whisper from "Bob" that a
   critical customer needs to talk to "Alice", "Bob" and "Ethel".
   "Alice" creates a sidebar to have a side discussion with the customer
   "Fred" including the participants in the current conference with the
   exception of "Carol" and "David", who remain in the active
   conference.  The difference from the previous scenario is that "Fred"
   is not part of the parent conference: this means that different
   policies might be involved, considering that "Fred" may access
   information coming from the parent conference, in case the sidebar
   was configured accordingly.  For this reason, in this scenario we
   assume that "Alice" disables all the media from the original (parent)
   conference within the sidebar.  This means that, while in the
   previous example "Alice" and "Bob" still heard the audio from the
   main conference in background, this time no background is made
   available.  "Alice" initiates the sidebar by sending a request to the
   conferencing system to create a conference reservation based upon the
   active conference object.  "Alice", "Bob" and "Ethel" would remain on
   the roster of the main conference in a hold state.  Whether or not
   the hold state of these participants is visible to other participants
   depends upon the individual and local policy.

             Figure 18: Client Creation of an External Sidebar

   1.  Upon receipt of the "sidebarByRefRequest" message to create a new
       sidebar conference, based upon the active conference specified by
       "confObjID" in the request, the conferencing system uses the
       received active conference to clone a conference reservation for
       the sidebar.  The sidebar reservation is NOT independent of the
       active conference (i.e., parent).  The conferencing system as
       before reserves or allocates a conference ID (confObjID*) to be
       used for any subsequent protocol requests from any of the members
       of the conference.  The conferencing system maintains the mapping
       between this conference ID and the conference object ID
       associated with the sidebar reservation through the conference
       instance.  Just as before, this mapping is mantained in "sidebar-
       parent".

   2.  Upon receipt of the "sidebarByRefResponse" message, which
       acknowledges the successful creation of the sidebar object,
       "Alice" decides that only "Bob" and "Ethel", along with the new
       participant "Fred" are to be involved in the sidebar.  Thus she
       manipulates the membership accordingly.  "Alice" also sets the
       media in the "conference-info" such that the participants in the
       sidebar don't receive any media from the main conference.  All
       these settings are provided to the conferencing system by means
       of a new "sidebarByRefRequest" message, with an "update"
       operation.

   3.  "Alice" sends the aforementioned "sidebarByRefRequest" to update
       the information in the reservation and to create an active
       conference.  Upon receipt of the "sidebarByRefRequest" with an
       operation of "update", the conferencing system ensures that
       "Alice" has the appropriate authority based on the policies
       associated with that specific conference object to perform the
       operation.  The conferencing system also validates the updated
       information in the reservation.  Since "Fred" is a new user for
       this conferencing system, a conference user identifier is created
       for "Fred".  Specifically, "Fred" is added to the conference by
       only providing his SIP URI.  Based upon the addressing
       information provided for "Fred" by "Alice", the call signaling to
       add "Fred" to the conference may be instigated through the Focus
       (e.g. if "Fred" had a "dial-out" method set as the target for
       him) at the actual activation of the sidebar.

   4.  The conference server sends a "sidebarByRefResponse" message and,
       depending upon the policies, the initiator of the request (i.e.,
       "Alice") and the participants in the sidebar (i.e., "Bob" and
       "Ethel") may be notified of his addition to the sidebar via the
       conference notification service.

6.7.  Floor control using sidebars

   Floor control with sidebars can be used to realize conferencing
   scenario such as an analyst briefing.  In this scenario, the
   conference call has a panel of speakers who are allowed to talk in
   the main conference.  The other participants are the analysts, who
   are not allowed to speak unless they have the floor.  To request
   access to the floor, they have to join a new sidebar with the
   moderator and ask their question.  The moderator can also whisper to
   each analyst what their status/position in the floor control queue,
   similar to the example in Figure 23.  It should be noted that other
   mechanisms which don't make use of sidebars could be used for floor
   control such as those detailed in BFCP.

   Figure 20 provides an example of the configuration involved for this
   type of conference.  As in the previous sidebar examples, there is
   the main conference along with a sidebar.  "Alice" and "Bob" are the
   main participants in the conference, with "A1", "A2" and "A3"
   representing the analysts.  The sidebar remains active throughout the
   conference, with the moderator, "Carol", serving as the chair.  As

Internet-Draft           CCMP Call Flow Examples           December 2009


   discussed previously, the sidebar conference is NOT independent of
   the active conference (i.e., parent).  The analysts are provided the
   conference object ID associated with the active sidebar when they
   join the main conference.  The conferencing system also allocates a
   conference ID to be used for any subsequent manipulations of the
   sidebar conference.  The conferencing system maintains the mapping
   between this conference ID and the conference object ID associated
   with the active sidebar conference through the conference instance.
   The analysts are permanently muted while in the main conference.  The
   analysts are moved to the sidebar when they wish to speak.  Only one
   analyst is given the floor at a given time.  All participants in the
   main conference receive audio from the sidebar conference, as well as
   audio provided by the panelists in the main conference.




      (To Be added).



                  Figure 20: Floor Control with sidebars

   1.  "A1" wishes to ask a question, so he sends a Floor Request
       message to the floor control server.

   2.  Upon receipt of the request, the floor control server notifies
       the moderator, "Carol" of the active sidebar conference, whose
       serving as the floor chair.

   3.  Since no other analysts have yet requested the floor, "Carol"
       indicates to the floor control server that "A1" may be granted
       the floor.

6.8.  Whispering or Private Messages

   The case of private messages can be handled as a sidebar with just
   two participants, similarly to the example in section Section 6.5.
   Unlike the previous example, anyway, rather than using audio within
   the sidebar, "Alice" could just add an additional text based media
   stream to the sidebar in order to convey her whisper.  From the

   protocol point of view, with reference to the messages described in
   Figure 17, only the third CCMP message (a sidebarByValRequest/update)
   changes, as depicted in Figure 22.

       Figure 22: SidebarByVal Update for private messages scenario

   The other context, referred to as whisper, in this document refers to
   situations involving one time media targetted to specific user(s).
   An example of a whisper would be an announcement injected only to the
   conference chair or to a new participant joining a conference.
   Please notice that such an announcement would not be conveyed by
   means of CCMP, while rather by means of a notification protocol
   related to it, e.g. a SIP event package, XMPP, or even a multimedia
   announcement.  CCMP would only be involved with respect to the
   creation of an ad-hoc sidebar, as it will be clearer in the following
   lines.

   Figure 23 provides an example of one user "Alice" who's chairing a
   fixed length conference with "Bob" and "Carol".  The configuration is
   such that only the chair is providing a warning when there is only 10
   minutes left in the conference.  At that time, "Alice" is moved into
   a sidebar created by the conferencing system and only "Alice"
   receives the announcement.




          (To Be completed).


                            Figure 23: Whisper

   1.  When the conferencing system determines that there is only 10
       minutes left in the conference which "Alice" is chairing, the
       conferencing system directly creates an active sidebar
       conference, based on the active conference associated with
       "Alice".  This sidebar conference is NOT independent of the
       active conference (i.e., parent).  The conferencing system also

Internet-Draft           CCMP Call Flow Examples           December 2009


       allocates a conference ID to be used for any subsequent
       manipulations of the sidebar conference.

   2.  Immediately upon creation of the active sidebar conference, the
       announcement media is provided to "Alice".  Depending upon the
       policies, Alice may be notified of her addition to the sidebar
       via the conference notification service.  "Alice" continues to
       receive the media from the main conference.

   3.  Upon completion of the announcement, "Alice" is removed from the
       siebar and the sidebar conference is deleted.

   4.  "Alice" is notified of her removal from the sidebar via the
       conference notification service.

6.9.  Observing and Coaching

   An example of observing and coaching is shown in figure Figure 25.
   In this example, call center agent "Bob" is involved in a conference
   with customer "Carol".  Since "Bob" is a new agent and "Alice" sees
   that he has been on the call with "Carol" for longer than normal, she
   decides to observe the call and coach "Bob" as necessary.

   Consider the following as the conference document associated with the
   video conference involving Bob (the call agent) and Carol (the
   customer) (Figure 24):

   1.  Upon receipt of the sidbarByRefRequest/create from "Alice" to
       "create" a new sidebar conference from the confObjID received in
       the request, the conferencing system uses the received active
       conference to clone a conference reservation for the sidebar.
       The conferencing system also allocates a conference ID to be used
       for any subsequent protocol requests from any of the members of
       the conference.  The conferencing system maintains the mapping
       between this conference ID and the confObjID associated with the
       sidebar reservation through the conference instance.  The
       conference server sends a sidebarByRefResponse message with the
       new confObjID and relevant confInfo.

   2.  Upon receipt of the confResponse message, "Alice" manipulates the
       data received in the confInfo in the response.  "Alice" wants
       only "Bob" to be involved in the sidebar, thus she updates the
       "allowed-users-list" to include only "Bob".  "Alice" also wants
       the audio to be received by herself and "Bob" from the original
       conference, but wants any outgoing audio from herself to be
       restricted to the participants in the sidebar, whereas "Bob's"
       outgoing audio should go to the main conference, so that both
       "Alice" and the customer "Carol" hear the same audio from "Bob".
       "Alice" sends a sidebarByRefRequest message with an "update"
       operation including the updated conference information.

   3.  Upon receipt of the sidbarByRefRequest message with an "update"
       operation, the conferencing system ensures that "Alice" has the
       appropriate authority based on the policies associated with that
       specific conference object to perform the operation.

   4.  After validating the data, the conference server sends a
       sidebarByRefResponse message.  Based upon the addressing
       information provided for "Bob" by "Alice", the call signaling to
       add "Bob" to the sidebar with the appropriate media
       characteristics is instigated through the Focus.  "Bob" is
       notified of his addition to the sidebar via the conference
       notification service, thus he is aware that "Alice" the
       supervisor is available for coaching him through this call.

7.  Removing participants and deleting conferences

   The following scenarios detail the basic operations associated with
   removing participants from conferences and entirely deleting
   conferences.  The examples assume that a conference has already been
   correctly established, with media, if applicable, per one of the
   examples in Section 5.

7.1.  Removing a Party

   Figure 27 provides an example of one client "Alice" removing another
   participant "Bob" from a conference.  This example assumes an
   established conference with "Alice", "Bob", "Claire" and "Duck".  In
   this example, "Alice" wants to remove "Bob" from the conference so

   that the group can continue in the same conference without "Bob"'s
   participation.

   2.  Based upon the addressing and media information in the conference
       object for "Bob" in the "user" element, the conference instigates
       the process to remove "Bob" (e.g., the call signaling to remove
       "Bob" from the conference is instigated through the Focus).  The
       conference server updates the data in the conference object, thus
       removing "Bob" from the "users" list.  After updating the data,
       the conference server sends a userResponse message to "Alice".
       Depending upon the policies, other participants (e.g.  "Claire")
       may be notified of the removal of "Bob" from the conference via
       the Conference Notification Service.

8.  Additional Conference Scenarios and Examples

   The following are additional scenarios making use of the XCON
   framework and associated protocols.  In some cases, these examples
   make use of some of the building block scenarios detailed in the
   previous example sections, in which case the appropriate scenario is
   referenced rather than duplicating details.  In addition, in cases
   where the scenarios make use of other protocols, as in the previous
   section, the appropriate reference in the form of a title to the

Internet-Draft           CCMP Call Flow Examples           December 2009


   specific flow in the appropriate protocol document is included.

8.1.  Chat

   The chat functionality described in this section of the document
   allows clients that use the XCON framework and protocols for other
   media types (e.g. voice/video) to utilize the same conference control
   mechanisms and conferencing system to establish, update and delete a
   conference instance associated with an Instant Messaging (IM) chat
   session, independent of the IM chat protocol.  In some cases(e.g.,
   Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) chat), this would provide
   additional capabilities, such as sidebars.  This approach also allows
   the conferencing system to provide a natural interworking point for
   various IM protocols, the details of the interworking are outside the
   scope of this document.

   An IM client wishing to join a conference uses standardized
   centralized conferencing mechanisms for creating and joining a
   conference, as identified in the previous sections.  The request to
   send an IM to an IM media session is specific to the IM protocol
   (e.g., MSRP SEND), just as there is specific media control messaging
   for other types of sessions.  An IM client connecting to a
   conferencing system has a 1:1 relationship with the IM media
   signaling entity in the conferencing system.  This relationship is
   referred to as an IM session.  Further details of the correlation of
   the IM session identifiers with the XCON session identifiers is
   provided in [I-D.boulton-xcon-session-chat].  The IM media signaling
   entity is responsible for distribution of all the messages to the
   other participants.

   As with the other example conferences created, each IM session is
   logically associated with a specific conference.  The conference
   itself has a specific identifier in the form of the XCON-URI, which
   is passed in the "confObjID" element in the CCMP messages.  This
   provides the relevant association between IM session and a
   centralized conference.

   An IM client wishing to delete a chat room uses standardized
   mechanisms for deleting a conference instance, such as those detailed
   in Section 7.2.

8.1.1.  Basic Chat Operations

   This section provides details of the realization of the Multi-party
   IM (chat) within the context of the centralized conferencing
   framework.  A brief discussion and diagrams are provided for
   creating, joining, and deleting a chat based conference.  The
   discovery of chat rooms available on a specific conferencing system



Barnes, et al.            Expires July 2, 2010                 [Page 68]

Internet-Draft           CCMP Call Flow Examples           December 2009


   is inherent in the blueprint capability provided by the conferencing
   system.  The objective of this section is to further illustrate the
   model, mechanisms and protocols presented in the previous sections
   and also serves to validate that the model, mechanisms and protocols
   are sufficient to support IM chat.

   It should be noted that not all entities impacted by the request are
   shown in the diagram (e.g., Focus), but rather the emphasis is on the
   new entities introduced by this centralized conferencing framework.

8.1.1.1.  Creating a Chat Room

   There are different ways to create a conference.  A participant can
   create a conference using call signaling means only, such as SIP, as
   detailed in [RFC4579].  For a conferencing client to have more
   flexibility in defining the charaterisitics and capabilities of a
   chat based conference, a conferencing client would implement a
   conference control protocol client.  By using a conference control
   protocol, the client can determine the capabilities of a conferencing
   system and its various resources.

   Figure 31 provides an example of one client "Alice" determining the
   conference blueprints available to support various types of chat
   rooms for a particular conferencing system and creating a chat based
   conference using the desired blueprint.



      Details to be added.




                  Figure 31: Client Creation of Chat room

   Upon receipt of the Conference Control Protocol request for
   blueprints associated with chat rooms, the conferencing system would
   first authenticate "Alice" (and allocate a conference user
   identifier, if necessary) and then ensure that "Alice" has the
   appropriate authority based on system policies to receive any chat
   room based blueprints supported by that system.  Any blueprints that
   "Alice" is authorized to use are returned in a response, along with
   the conference user ID.

   Upon receipt of the Conference Control Protocol response containing
   the blueprints, "Alice" determines which blueprint to use for the
   conference to be created.  "Alice" creates a conference object based
   on the blueprint (i.e., clones) and modifies applicable fields, such



Barnes, et al.            Expires July 2, 2010                 [Page 69]

Internet-Draft           CCMP Call Flow Examples           December 2009


   as membership list, topic details, and start time.  "Alice" then
   sends a request to the conferencing system to create a conference
   reservation based upon the updated blueprint.

   Upon receipt of the Conference Control Protocol request to "create" a
   conference based upon the blueprint in the request, the conferencing
   system ensures that the blueprint received is a valid blueprint (i.e.
   the values of the various field are within range).  The conferencing
   system determines the appropriate read/write access of any users to
   be added to a conference based on this blueprint (using membership,
   roles, etc.).  The conferencing system uses the received blueprint to
   clone a conference reservation.  The conferencing system also
   reserves or allocates a conference ID to be used for any subsequent
   protocol requests from any of the members of the conference.  The
   conferencing system maintains the mapping between this conference ID
   and the conference object ID associated with the reservation through
   the conference instance.

   Upon receipt of the conference control protocol response to reserve
   the conference, "Alice" now creates an active chat room using that
   reservation.  "Alice" provides the conference information, including
   the necessary conference ID, to desired participants to allow them to
   join the chat room.  "Alice" may also add other users to the chat
   room.  When the first participant, including "Alice", requests to be
   added to the conference, an active conference and focus are created.
   The focus is associated with the conference ID received in the
   request.



                           (CCMP Messaging details not available yet.
          Plan is to reference detailed flows in
          previous sections
          in the example.)


              Figure 32: Chatroom Creation Messaging Details

8.1.1.2.  Joining a Chat Room

   A participant can join and leave the conference using call signaling
   means only, such as SIP.  However, in order to perform richer
   conference control a user client can implement a conference control
   protocol client.  By using a conference control protocol, the client
   can affect its own state and the state of other participants,
   depending upon policies, which may indirectly affect the state of any
   of the conference participants.

Internet-Draft           CCMP Call Flow Examples           December 2009


   In the example in section Section 8.1.1.1, "Alice" has reserved a
   chat room .  "Alice" has also already joined the conference and made
   the chat room active.  "Alice" can either add additional participants
   to the chat room or provide the conference information, including the
   necessary conference ID, to desired participants and allow them to
   request to join themselves.  Any participants that have the authority
   to manipulate the conference would receive the conference object
   identifier of the active conference object in the response to their
   request to join.

   Figure 33 provides an example of "Bob" joining the chat room using
   the conference ID provided by "Alice" (e.g., in an IM).



     Details to be added.


                      Figure 33: Joining a chat room

   Upon receipt of the Conference Control Protocol request to "add" a
   party ("Bob") in the specific conference as identified by the
   conference object ID, the conferencing system must determine whether
   "Bob" is already a user of this conferencing system or whether he is
   a new user.  If "Bob" is a new user for this conferencing system, a
   Conference User Identifier is created for Bob. The conferencing
   system must also ensure that "Bob" has the appropriate authority
   based on the policies associated with that specific conference object
   to perform the operation.

   Once "Bob" has been successfully added to the chat room, a response
   is sent to "Bob".  Depending upon the policies, other participants
   (including "Bob") may be notified of the addition of "Bob" to the
   conference via the Conference Notification Service.



                           (CCMP Messaging details not available yet.
         Plan is to reference detailed flows in
          previous sections as appropriate
          in the example.)

8.1.1.3.  Deleting a Chat Room

   Depending upon the conferencing system policies and policies specific
   to the chat room, the creator of the chat would typically be the
   participant authorized to delete the chat room.

   In the example in section Section 8.1.1.1, "Alice" has created a chat
   room and provided the conference information, including the necessary
   conference ID, to desired participants and allow them to request to
   join themselves.  "Bob" and others are participants in the chat.
   Figure 35 provides an example of "Alice" later deleting this same
   chat room.


   Details to be added.


                      Figure 35: Deleting a chat room

   Upon receipt of the Conference Control Protocol request to "delete"
   the specific chat room as identified by the conference object ID, the
   conferencing system must determine whether "Alice" has the authority
   to delete this conference.  Since "Alice" is the creator of the
   conference, the "delete" operation is performed, with the appropriate
   signaling sent to the participants, including a response to "Alice"
   indicating that the chat room has been deleted.

   One step in the deletion of the chat room may include notifitying the
   participants (including "Bob") that they have been removed via the
   Conference Notification Service.



                           (CCMP Messaging details not available yet.

          previous sections .)

8.1.2.  Advanced Operations

   This section provides details of the realization of advanced chat
   features, such as sidebars and private messages, within the context
   of the centralized conferencing framework.  As with Section 8.1.1,
   the objective of this section is to further illustrate the model,
   mechanisms and protocols presented in the previous sections and also
   serves to validate that the model, mechanisms and protocols are



Barnes, et al.            Expires July 2, 2010                 [Page 72]

Internet-Draft           CCMP Call Flow Examples           December 2009


   sufficient to support advance IM chat features.

8.1.2.1.  Text Sidebar

   The concept of a 'sidebar' in conferencing system is fully described
   in the Sidebar section and related subsections within the
   Conferencing Scenarios Realization section of the centralized
   conferencing framework document [RFC5239].  The creation,
   manipulation and deletion of sidebars for chat rooms follows the same
   principles.

   A conference object representing a sidebar is created by cloning the
   parent associated with the existing conference and updating any
   information specific to the sidebar.  A sidebar conference object is
   implicitly linked to the parent conference object (i.e. it is not an
   independent object) and is associated with the parent conference
   object identifier.  A conferencing system manages and enforces the
   parent and appropriate localized restrictions on the sidebar
   conference object (e.g., no members from outside the parent
   conference instance can join, sidebar conference can not exist if
   parent conference is terminated, etc.).

   Figure 37 provides an example of one client "Alice" involved in
   active chat room with "Bob" and "Carol".  "Alice" wants to create a
   sidebar to have a side discussion with "Bob" while still receiving
   the session based messaging associated with the main chat room.
   Whether the text is interleaved with the main chat or whether a
   separate window is created for the sidebar is implementation
   specific.  "Alice" initiates the sidebar by sending a request to the
   conferencing system to create a conference chat reservation based
   upon the active chat conference object.  "Alice" and "Bob" would
   remain on the roster of the main conference, such that other
   participants could be aware of their participation in the main
   conference, while the text sidebar conference is occurring.




       Details to be added.


            Figure 37: Client Creation of a Sidebar Conference

   Upon receipt of the Conference Control Protocol request to "reserve"
   a new sidebar chat conference, based upon the active chat conference
   received in the request, the conferencing system uses the received
   active chat conference to clone a conference chat reservation for the
   sidebar.  As discussed previously, the sidebar reservation is NOT



Barnes, et al.            Expires July 2, 2010                 [Page 73]

Internet-Draft           CCMP Call Flow Examples           December 2009


   independent of the active conference (i.e., parent).  The
   conferencing system also reserves or allocates a conference ID to be
   used for any subsequent protocol requests from any of the members of
   the conference.  The conferencing system maintains the mapping
   between this conference ID and the conference object ID associated
   with the sidebar reservation through the conference instance.

   Upon receipt of the conference control protocol response to reserve
   the conference, "Alice" can now create an active chat conference
   using that reservation or create additional reservations based upon
   the existing reservations.  In this example, "Alice" wants only "Bob"
   to be involved in the sidebar, thus she manipulates the membership.
   "Alice" also only wants the text from the original conference, but
   wants the text within the sidebar to be restricted to the
   participants in the sidebar.  "Alice" sends a conference control
   protocol request to update the information in the reservation and to
   create an active conference.

   Upon receipt of the conference control protocol request to update the
   reservation and to create an active chat conference for the sidebar,
   as identified by the conference object ID, the conferencing system
   ensures that "Alice" has the appropriate authority based on the
   policies associated with that specific conference object to perform
   the operation.  The conferencing system must also validate the
   updated information in the reservation, ensuring that a member like
   "Bob" is already a user of this conferencing system.

   Depending upon the policies, the initiator of the request (i.e.,
   "Alice") and the participants in the sidebar (i.e., "Bob") may be
   notified of his addition to the sidebar via the conference
   notification service.

               Figure 38: Chatroom Sidebar Messaging Details

8.1.2.2.  Private Message

   The case of private messages can be handled as a sidebar with just
   two participants, identical to the example in section
   Section 8.1.2.1.  The other context, referred to as whisper, in this
   document refers to situations involving one time media targetted to
   specific user(s).  An example of a whisper would be a text message
   injected only to the conference chair or to a new participant joining
   a conference.

   Figure 39 provides an example of one user "Alice" who's chairing a
   fixed length conference with "Bob" and "Carol".  The configuration is
   such that only the chair is providing a warning when there is only 10
   minutes left in the conference.  At that time, "Alice" is moved into
   a sidebar created by the conferencing system and only "Alice"
   receives that text message announcing the 10 minute warning.




         Details to be added.


                            Figure 39: Whisper

   When the conferencing system determines that there is only 10 minutes
   left in the conference which "Alice" is chairing, rather than
   creating a reservation as was done for the sidebar in
   Section 8.1.2.1, the conferencing system directly creates an active
   chat sidebar conference, based on the active chat conference
   associated with "Alice".  As discussed previously, the sidebar
   conference is NOT independent of the active conference (i.e.,
   parent).  The conferencing system also allocates a conference ID to
   be used for any subsequent manipulations of the sidebar chat
   conference.  The conferencing system maintains the mapping between
   this conference ID and the conference object ID associated with the
   active sidebar conference through the conference instance.

   Immediately upon creation of the active chat sidebar conference, the
   text announcement is provided to "Alice".  Depending upon the
   policies, Alice may be notified of her addition to the sidebar via
   the conference notification service.  "Alice" continues to receive
   the text messages from the main conference.

   Upon delivery of the text announcement, "Alice" is removed from the
   sidebar and the sidebar conference is deleted.  Depending upon the
   policies, "Alice" may be notified of her removal from the sidebar via
   the conference notification service.



                   Details to be added.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA considerations.


10.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations applicable to the implementation of these
   call flows is documented in the XCON Framework, with additional
   security considerations documented in the CCMP document.  Where
   applicable, statements with regards to the necessary security are
   discussed in particular flows, however, since this is only an
   informational document, readers are strongly recommended to carefully
   consider the security considerations defined in the XCON Framework
   and the CCMP document.


11.  Change Summary

   NOTE TO THE RFC-Editor: Please remove this section prior to
   publication as an RFC.

   The following are the major changes between the 01 and the 02
   versions of the draft:

   o  updated the call flows in order to take into account the new
      versioning mechanism of the CCMP;


   o  clarified, per agreement in Stockholm, that cloning from a
      blueprint does not need a cloning-parent to be made available in
      the response;


   o  clarified that BFCP and CCMP-based media control are neither in
      conflict nor one the wrapper of the other; they act at different
      levels, and when both are involved, it is required that both grant
      a resource before it can be used by an interested participant;


   o  changed all the domains involved in the flows to make them
      compliant with [RFC2606];


   o  clarified that a successful creation of a new conference object
      may or may not contain the whole confInfo object in the response;
      in case it doesn't, a retrieve of the updated object can be
      achieved by issuing a confRequest/retrieve;

Internet-Draft           CCMP Call Flow Examples           December 2009


   o  clarified that the scenario in Section 6.1 only involves CCMP in
      adding the user to a conference; this includes requiring the use
      of a password only in adding the user to the conference object;
      the actual request for PIN/Password when joining thw conference is
      handled by means of out-of-band mechanisms (in this case at the
      media level, with the help of the MEDIACTRL framework);


   o  added and corrected Sidebars-related scenarios;


   o  added flows for some previously missing scenarios: Private
      Message/Whisper, Coaching Scenario, Removing a Party, Deleting a
      Conference;


   o


   The following are the major changes between the 00 and the 01
   versions of the draft:

   o  Updates to reflect change of CCMP to HTTP transport model.


   The following are the major changes between the individual 01 version
   to the WG 00:

   o  Updates to reflect most recent version of CCMP, including
      parameter names, etc.


   o  Added protocol details to many of the examples.


   o  Editorial: Simplifying intro, terms, etc.

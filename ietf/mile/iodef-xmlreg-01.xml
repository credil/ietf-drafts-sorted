<section title="Introduction" anchor="sec-intro">

  <t>IODEF extensions via class extension through AdditionalData and RecordItem elements, as per section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC5070"/>, generally register their namespaces and schemas with the IANA XML Namespace registry at http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/ns.html and the IANA XML Schema registry at http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/schema.html, respectively <xref target="RFC3688"/>.</t>

  <t>In addition to schema reviews required by IANA, these registry requests should be accompanied by a review by IODEF experts to ensure the specified AdditionalData and/or RecordItem contents are compatible with IODEF and with other existing IODEF extensions. This document specifies that review.</t>

<section title="Expert Review of IODEF-related XML Registry Entries" anchor="sec-main">
  
  <t>Changes to the XML Schema registry for schema names beginning with "urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:iodef" are subject to an additional IODEF <xref target="RFC5226">Expert Review</xref> for IODEF-correctness and -appropriateness.</t>

  <t>The IODEF expert(s) for these reviews will be designated by the IETF Security Area Directors.</t>

  <t>[IANA NOTE: The authors request that IANA list an IODEF Expert be
  designated by the IETF Security Area Directors on the XML Schema registry,
  responsible for performing an IODEF <xref target="RFC5226">Expert
  Review</xref> on schemas with names beginning with
  'urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:iodef', to be noted in the most appropriate way.
  This should appear in the same place as other expert designations, and note
  that the review is IODEF-specific. In addition, the References column of
  urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:iodef-1.0 at
  https://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/schema.html should be made to
  reference this document as well as RFC5070.]</t>

  <t>This document specifies additional expert reviews for IODEF extensions,
  on the XML Schema registry
  (http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/schema.html), in <xref
  target="sec-main"/>.</t>

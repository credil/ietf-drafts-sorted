          Methodology for Benchmarking SIP Networking Devices
                   draft-ietf-bmwg-sip-bench-meth-02

Abstract

   This document describes the methodology for benchmarking Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) performance as described in SIP
   benchmarking terminology document.  The methodology and terminology
   are to be used for benchmarking signaling plane performance with
   varying signaling and media load.  Both scale and establishment rate
   are measured by signaling plane performance.  The SIP Devices to be
   benchmarked may be a single device under test (DUT) or a system under
   test (SUT).  Benchmarks can be obtained and compared for different
   types of devices such as SIP Proxy Server, SBC, and server paired
   with a media relay or Firewall/NAT device.

Internet-Draft        SIP Benchmarking Methodology             July 2010


1.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, conforming to [RFC2119] and indicate requirement
   levels for compliant implementations.

   Terms specific to SIP [RFC3261] performance benchmarking are defined
   in [I-D.sip-bench-term].

   RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make the intent
   of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While this
   document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards track
   document.  The term Throughput is defined in [RFC2544].


2.  Introduction

   This document describes the methodology for benchmarking Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) performance as described in Terminology
   document [I-D.sip-bench-term].  The methodology and terminology are
   to be used for benchmarking signaling plane performance with varying
   signaling and media load.  Both scale and establishment rate are
   measured by signaling plane performance.

   The SIP Devices to be benchmarked may be a single device under test
   (DUT) or a system under test (SUT).  The DUT is a SIP Server, which
   may be any [RFC3261] conforming device.  The SUT can be any device or
   group of devices containing RFC 3261 conforming functionality along
   with Firewall and/or NAT functionality.  This enables benchmarks to
   be obtained and compared for different types of devices such as SIP
   Proxy Server, SBC, SIP proxy server paired with a media relay or
   Firewall/NAT device.  SIP Associated Media benchmarks can also be
   made when testing SUTs.

   The test cases covered in this methodology document provide
   benchmarks metrics of Registration Rate, SIP Session Establishment
   Rate, Session Capacity, IM Rate, and Presence Rate.  These can be
   benchmarked with or without associated Media.  Some cases are also
   included to cover Forking, Loop detecion, Encrypted SIP, and SIP
   Flooding.  The test topologies that can be used are described in the
   Test Setup section.  Topologies are provided for benchmarking of a
   DUT or SUT.  Benchmarking with Associated Media can be performed when
   using a SUT.

   SIP permits a wide range of configuration options that are also
   explained in the Test Setup section.  Benchmark metrics could

   possibly be impacted by Associated Media.  The selected values for
   Session Duration and Media Streams Per Session enable benchmark
   metrics to be benchmarked without Associated Media.  Session Setup
   Rate could possibly be impacted by the selected value for Maximum
   Sessions Attempted.  The benchmark for Session Establishment Rate is
   measured with a fixed value for maximum Session Attempts.


3.  Test Topologies

   Figures 1 through 3 below provide various topologies to perform the
   SIP Performance Benchmarking.  These figures show the Device Under
   Test (DUT) to be a single server or a System Under Test (SUT).  Test
   Topology options to include benchmarking with Associated Media
   require use of a SUT and are shown in Figures 3.

4.  Test Considerations

4.1.  Selection of SIP Transport Protocol

      Test cases may be performed with any transport protocol supported
      by SIP.  This includes, but is not limited to, SIP TCP, SIP UDP,
      and TLS.  The protocol used for the SIP transport protocol must be
      reported with benchmarking results.


4.2.  Signaling Server







Poretsky, et al.        Expires January 13, 2011                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        SIP Benchmarking Methodology             July 2010


      The Server is a SIP-speaking device that complies with RFC 3261.
      The purpose of this document is to benchmark SIP performance, not
      conformance.  Conformance to [RFC3261] is assumed for all tests.
      The Server may be the DUT or a component of a SUT that includes
      Firewall and/or NAT functionality.  The components of the SUT may
      be a single physical device or separate devices.


4.3.  Associated Media

      Some tests may require associated media to be present for each SIP
      session.  The Server is not involved in the forwarding of media.
      Associated Media can be benchmarked only with a SUT in which the
      media traverses a Media Relay, Firewall, NAT, or Firewall/NAT
      device.  The test topologies to be used when benchmarking SUT
      performance for Associated Media are shown in Figures 4 and 5, in
      which the SIP signaling is bidirectional and the Associated Media
      is unidirectional.

4.4.  Selection of Associated Media Protocol

      The test cases specified in this document provide SIP performance
      independent of the protocol used for the media stream.  Any media
      protocol supported by SIP may be used.  This includes, but is not
      limited to, RTP, RTSP, and SRTP.  The protocol used for Associated
      Media MUST be reported with benchmarking results.

4.5.  Number of Associated Media Streams per SIP Session

      Benchmarking results may vary with the number of media streams per
      SIP session.  When benchmarking a SUT for voice, a single media
      stream is used.  When benchmarking a SUT for voice and video, two
      media streams are used.  The number of Associated Media Streams
      MUST be reported with benchmarking results.

4.6.  Session Duration

      SUT performance benchmarks may vary with the duration of SIP
      sessions.  Session Duration MUST be reported with benchmarking
      results.  A Session Duration of zero seconds indicates
      transmission of a BYE immediately following successful SIP
      establishment indicate by receipt of a 200 OK.  An infinite
      Session Duration indicates that a BYE is never transmitted.

4.7.  Attempted Sessions per Second






Poretsky, et al.        Expires January 13, 2011                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        SIP Benchmarking Methodology             July 2010


      DUT and SUT performance benchmarks may vary with the the rate of
      attempted sessions offered by the Tester.  Attempted Sessions per
      Second MUST be reported with benchmarking results.

4.8.  Stress Testing

   Discussion:
      The purpose of this document is to benchmark SIP performance, not
      system stability under stressful conditions such as a high rate of
      Attempted Sessions per Second.

6.  Test Cases

6.1.  Baseline Session Establishment Rate

   Objective:
      To benchmark the Session Establishment Rate of the DUT/SUT with
      zero failures.
   Procedure:
      1.  Configure the test bed in the test topology shown in Figure 4.
      2.  Configure Tester with a Session Attempt Rate = 100 SPS,
          maximum Session Attempts = 100,000 and Media Streams Per
          Session=0.
      3.  Start Tester to initiate SIP Session establishment with the
          DUT.
      4.  Measure Session Attempt Failures and total Established
          Sessions at the Tester.
      5.  If a Session Attempt Failure is recorded then reduce the
          Session Attempt Rate configured on the Tester by 50%.
      6.  If no Session Attempt Failure is recorded then increase the
          Session Attempt Rate configured on the Tester by 50%.

      7.  Repeat steps 3 through 6 until the Session Establishment Rate
          is obtained and recorded.
   Expected Results:  This is the scenario to obtain the maximum Session
      Establishment Rate of the test bed when no DUT?SUT is present.
      The results of this test might be used to normalize test results
      performed on different test beds or simply to better understand
      the impact of the DUT/SUT on the test bed in question.

6.2.  Session Establishment Rate

   Objective:
      To benchmark the Session Establishment Rate of the DUT/SUT with
      zero failures.
   Procedure:
      1.  Configure the DUT in the test topology shown in Figure 1 or
          SUT as shown in Figures 2 or 3.
      2.  Configure Tester with a Session Attempt Rate = 100 SPS,
          maximum Session Attempts = 100,000 and Media Streams Per
          Session=0.
      3.  Start Tester to initiate SIP Session establishment with the
          DUT.
      4.  Measure Session Attempt Failures and total Established
          Sessions at the Tester.
      5.  If a Session Attempt Failure is recorded then reduce the
          Session Attempt Rate configured on the Tester by 50%.
      6.  If no Session Attempt Failure is recorded then increase the
          Session Attempt Rate configured on the Tester by 50%.
      7.  Repeat steps 3 through 6 until the Session Establishment Rate
          is obtained and recorded.
   Expected Results:  This is the scenario to obtain the maximum Session
      Establishment Rate of the DUT/SUT.

6.3.  Session Establishment Rate with Media

   Objective:
      To benchmark the Session Establishment Rate of the SUT with zero
      failures when Associated Media is included in the benchmark test.
   Procedure:
      1.  Configure the SUT in the test topology shown in Figure 2 or 3.
      2.  Configure Tester for a Session Attempt Rate = 100 SPS, maximum
          Session Attempts = 100,000 and Media Streams Per Session = 1.
          The rate of offered load for each media stream SHOULD be (eq
          1) Offered Load per Media Stream = Throughput / maximum
          sessions attempted, where Throughput is defined in [RFC2544].
      3.  Start Tester to initiate SIP Session establishment with the
          SUT and transmit media through the SUT to a destination other
          than the server.

      4.  At the Tester measure Session Attempt Failures, total
          Established Sessions, and Packet Loss [RFC2544] of the media.
      5.  If a Session Attempt Failure or Packet Loss is recorded then
          reduce the Session Attempt Rate configured on the Tester by
          50%.
      6.  If no Session Attempt Failure or Packet Loss is recorded then
          increase the Session Attempt Rate configured on the Tester by
          50%.
      7.  Repeat steps 3 through 6 until the Session Establishment Rate
          is obtained and recorded.

      are expected to be identical to the Session Establishment Rate
      results obtained without media in the case where the server is
      running on a platform separate from the platform on which the
      Media Relay, NAT or Firewall is running.  Session Establishment
      Rate results obtained with Associated Media may be lower than

          Session Attempt Rate configured on the Tester by 50%.
      8.  Repeat steps 4 through 7 until the Session Establishment Rate
          is obtained and recorded.

      Media with any number of media streams per SIP session may be
      lower than the Session Capacity without Media result if the Media
      Relay, NAT or Firewall is sharing a platform with the server.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not requires any IANA considerations.


8.  Security Considerations

   Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of
   Internet or corporate networks as long as benchmarking is not
   performed on devices or systems connected to production networks.
   Security threats and how to counter these in SIP and the media layer
   is discussed in RFC3261, RFC3550, and RFC3711 and various other
   drafts.  This document attempts to formalize a set of common
   methodology for benchmarking performance of SIP devices in a lab
   environment.

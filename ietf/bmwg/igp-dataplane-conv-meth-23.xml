    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the methodology for benchmarking Link-State
      Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) Route Convergence. The methodology is to
      be used for benchmarking IGP convergence time through externally
      observable (black box) data plane measurements. The methodology can be
      applied to any link-state IGP, such as IS-IS and OSPF.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <section title="Motivation">
        <t>Convergence time is a critical performance parameter. Service
        Providers use IGP convergence time as a key metric of router design
        and architecture. Fast network convergence can be optimally achieved
        through deployment of fast converging routers. Customers of Service
        Providers use packet loss due to Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
        convergence as a key metric of their network service quality. IGP
        route convergence is a Direct Measure of Quality (DMOQ) when
        benchmarking the data plane. The fundamental basis by which network
        users and operators benchmark convergence is packet loss and other
        packet impairments, which are externally observable events having
        direct impact on their application performance. For this reason it is
        important to develop a standard methodology for benchmarking
        link-state IGP convergence time through externally observable
        (black-box) data plane measurements. All factors contributing to
        convergence time are accounted for by measuring on the data plane.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Factors for IGP Route Convergence Time">
        <t>There are four major categories of factors contributing to the
        measured IGP convergence time. As discussed in <xref
        target="Vi02"></xref>, <xref target="Ka02"></xref>, <xref
        target="Fi02"></xref>, <xref target="Al00"></xref>, <xref
        target="Al02"></xref>, and <xref target="Fr05"></xref>, these
        categories are Event Detection, Shortest Path First (SPF) Processing,
        Link State Advertisement (LSA) / Link State Packet (LSP)
        Advertisement, and Forwarding Information Base (FIB) Update. These
        have numerous components that influence the convergence time,
        including but not limited to the list below:</t>

              </list></t>

            <t>Increased Forwarding Delay due to Queueing</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The contribution of each of these factors listed above will vary
        with each router vendors' architecture and IGP implementation. Routers
        may have a centralized forwarding architecture, in which one
        forwarding table is calculated and referenced for all arriving
        packets, or a distributed forwarding architecture, in which the
        central forwarding table is calculated and distributed to the
        interfaces for local look-up as packets arrive. The distributed
        forwarding tables are typically maintained in hardware.</t>

        <t>The variation in router architecture and implementation
        necessitates the design of a convergence test that considers all of
        these components contributing to convergence time and is independent
        of the Device Under Test (DUT) architecture and implementation. The
        benefit of designing a test for these considerations is that it
        enables black-box testing in which knowledge of the routers' internal
        implementation is not required. It is then possible to make valid use
        of the convergence benchmarking metrics when comparing routers from
        different vendors.</t>

        <t>Convergence performance is tightly linked to the number of tasks a
        router has to deal with. As the most impacting tasks are mainly
        related to the control plane and the data plane, the more the DUT is
        stressed as in a live production environment, the closer performance
        measurement results match the ones that would be observed in a live
        production environment.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Use of Data Plane for IGP Route Convergence Benchmarking">
        <t>Customers of Service Providers use packet loss and other packet
        impairments as metrics to calculate convergence time. Packet loss and
        other packet impairments are externally observable events having
        direct impact on customers' application performance. For this reason
        it is important to develop a standard router benchmarking methodology
        that is a Direct Measure of Quality (DMOQ) for measuring IGP
        convergence. An additional benefit of using packet loss for
        calculation of IGP Route Convergence time is that it enables black-box
        tests to be designed. Data traffic can be offered to the Device Under
        Test (DUT), an emulated network event can be forced to occur, and
        packet loss and other impaired packets can be externally measured to
        calculate the convergence time. Knowledge of the DUT architecture and
        IGP implementation is not required. There is no need to rely on the
        DUT to produce the test results. There is no need to build intrusive
        test harnesses for the DUT. All factors contributing to convergence
        time are accounted for by measuring on the dataplane.</t>

        <t>Figure <xref format="counter" target="remote_lb"></xref> shows the
        test topology to measure IGP convergence time due to remote
        Convergence Events of a member of an Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) set
        (<xref target="testcase_remote_lb_link_failure"></xref>). In this
        topology the two routers DUT1 and DUT2 are considered System Under
        Test (SUT) and MUST be identically configured devices of the same
        model. Router DUT1 is configured with each egress interface as a
        member of a single ECMP set and the Tester emulates N+1 neighbor
        routers (N&gt;0), one for the Ingress Interface (RTa) and one for each
        member of the ECMP set (RTb1...RTbN). IGP adjacencies MUST be
        established between Tester and SUT, one on each interface of SUT. For
        this purpose each of the N+1 routers emulated by the Tester
        establishes one adjacency with the SUT (N-1 emulated routers are
        adjacent to DUT1 egress interfaces, one emulated router is adjacent to
        DUT1 Ingress Interface, and one emulated router is adjacent to DUT2).
        In this topology there is a possibility of a packet forwarding loop
        that may occur transiently between DUT1 and DUT2 during convergence
        (micro-loop, see <xref target="Sh10"></xref>). When the test specifies

    <section anchor="section_conv_and_loc"
             title="Convergence Time and Loss of Connectivity Period">
      <t>Two concepts will be highlighted in this section: convergence time
      and loss of connectivity period.</t>

      <t>The Route Convergence <xref target="Po11t"></xref> time indicates the
      period in time between the Convergence Event Instant <xref
      target="Po11t"></xref> and the instant in time the DUT is ready to
      forward traffic for a specific route on its Next-Best Egress Interface
      and maintains this state for the duration of the Sustained Convergence
      Validation Time <xref target="Po11t"></xref>. To measure Route
      Convergence time, the Convergence Event Instant and the traffic received
      from the Next-Best Egress Interface need to be observed.</t>

      <t>The Route Loss of Connectivity Period <xref target="Po11t"></xref>
      indicates the time during which traffic to a specific route is lost
      following a Convergence Event until Full Convergence <xref
      target="Po11t"></xref> completes. This Route Loss of Connectivity Period
      can consist of one or more Loss Periods <xref target="Ko02"></xref>. For
      the testcases described in this document it is expected to have a single
      Loss Period. To measure Route Loss of Connectivity Period, the traffic
      received from the Preferred Egress Interface and the traffic received
      from the Next-Best Egress Interface need to be observed.</t>

      <t>The Route Loss of Connectivity Period is most important since that
      has a direct impact on the network user's application performance.</t>

      <t>In general the Route Convergence time is larger than or equal to the
      Route Loss of Connectivity Period. Depending on which Convergence Event
      occurs and how this Convergence Event is applied, traffic for a route
      may still be forwarded over the Preferred Egress Interface after the
      Convergence Event Instant, before converging to the Next-Best Egress
      Interface. In that case the Route Loss of Connectivity Period is shorter
      than the Route Convergence time.</t>

      <t>At least one condition needs to be fulfilled for Route Convergence
      time to be equal to Route Loss of Connectivity Period. The condition is
      that the Convergence Event causes an instantaneous traffic loss for the
      measured route. A fiber cut on the Preferred Egress Interface is an
      example of such a Convergence Event.</t>

      <t>A second condition applies to Route Convergence time measurements
      based on Connectivity Packet Loss <xref target="Po11t"></xref>. This
      second condition is that there is only a single Loss Period during Route
      Convergence. For the testcases described in this document this is
      expected to be the case.</t>

      <section anchor="conv_time_no_instant_loss"
               title="Convergence Events without instant traffic loss">
        <t>To measure convergence time benchmarks for Convergence Events
        caused by a Tester, such as an IGP cost change, the Tester MAY start
        to discard all traffic received from the Preferred Egress Interface at
        the Convergence Event Instant, or MAY separately observe packets
        received from the Preferred Egress Interface prior to the Convergence
        Event Instant. This way these Convergence Events can be treated the
        same as Convergence Events that cause instantaneous traffic loss.</t>

        <t>To measure convergence time benchmarks without instantaneous
        traffic loss (either real or induced by the Tester) at the Convergence
        Event Instant, such as a reversion of a link failure Convergence
        Event, the Tester SHALL only observe packet statistics on the
        Next-Best Egress Interface. If using the Rate-Derived method to
        benchmark convergence times for such Convergence Events, the Tester
        MUST collect a timestamp at the Convergence Event Instant. If using a
        loss-derived method to benchmark convergence times for such
        Convergence Events, the Tester MUST measure the period in time between
        the Start Traffic Instant and the Convergence Event Instant. To
        measure this period in time the Tester can collect timestamps at the
        Start Traffic Instant and the Convergence Event Instant.</t>

        <t>The Convergence Event Instant together with the receive rate
        observations on the Next-Best Egress Interface allow to derive the
        convergence time benchmarks using the Rate-Derived Method <xref
        target="Po11t"></xref>.</t>

        <t>By observing packets on the Next-Best Egress Interface only, the
        observed Impaired Packet count is the number of Impaired Packets
        between Traffic Start Instant and Convergence Recovery Instant. To
        measure convergence times using a loss-derived method, the Impaired
        Packet count between the Convergence Event Instant and the Convergence
        Recovery Instant is needed. The time between Traffic Start Instant and
        Convergence Event Instant must be accounted for. An example may
        clarify this.</t>

        <t>Figure <xref format="counter"
        target="non_instant_loss_example"></xref> illustrates a Convergence
        Event without instantaneous traffic loss for all routes. The top graph
        shows the Forwarding Rate over all routes, the bottom graph shows the
        Forwarding Rate for a single route Rta. Some time after the
        Convergence Event Instant, Forwarding Rate observed on the Preferred
        Egress Interface starts to decrease. In the example, route Rta is the
        first route to experience packet loss at time Ta. Some time later, the
        Forwarding Rate observed on the Next-Best Egress Interface starts to
        increase. In the example, route Rta is the first route to complete
        convergence at time Ta'.</t>

        instant of the Route Loss of Connectivity Period can be different for

        global statistics over all routes. An example may clarify this.</t>

        <t>Following a Convergence Event, route Rta is the first route for

        <t>If the DUT implementation were such that route Rta would be the
        first route for which traffic loss ends at time Ta' (with Ta'&gt;Tb)
        and route Rtb would be the last route for which traffic loss ends at
        time Tb' (with Tb'&gt;Ta'). By only observing global traffic
        statistics over all routes, the minimum Route Loss of Connectivity
        Period would be measured as Ta'-Ta. The maximum calculated Route Loss
        of Connectivity Period would be Tb'-Ta. The real minimum and maximum
        Route Loss of Connectivity Periods are Ta'-Ta and Tb'-Tb. Illustrating
        this with the numbers Ta=0, Tb=1, Ta'=3, and Tb'=5, would give a Loss
        of Connectivity Period between 3 and 5 derived from the global traffic
        statistics, versus the real Loss of Connectivity Period between 3 and
        4.</t>

        <t>If the DUT implementation were such that route Rtb would be the
        first for which packet loss ends at time Tb'' and route Rta would be
        the last for which packet impairment ends at time Ta'', then the
        minimum and maximum Route Loss of Connectivity Periods derived by
        observing only global traffic statistics would be Tb''-Ta, and
        Ta''-Ta. The real minimum and maximum Route Loss of Connectivity
        Periods are Tb''-Tb and Ta''-Ta. Illustrating this with the numbers
        Ta=0, Tb=1, Ta''=5, Tb''=3, would give a Loss of Connectivity Period
        between 3 and 5 derived from the global traffic statistics, versus the
        real Loss of Connectivity Period between 2 and 5.</t>

        <t>The two implementation variations in the above example would result
        in the same derived minimum and maximum Route Loss of Connectivity
        Periods when only observing the global packet statistics, while the
        real Route Loss of Connectivity Periods are different.</t>

    <section title="Test Considerations">
      <section title="IGP Selection">
        <t>The test cases described in Section <xref format="counter"
        target="test_cases"></xref> can be used for link-state IGPs, such as
        IS-IS or OSPF. The IGP convergence time test methodology is
        identical.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Routing Protocol Configuration">
        <t>The obtained results for IGP convergence time may vary if other
        routing protocols are enabled and routes learned via those protocols
        are installed. IGP convergence times SHOULD be benchmarked without
        routes installed from other protocols. Any enabled IGP routing
        protocol extension (such as extensions for Traffic Engineering) and
        any enabled IGP routing protocol security mechanism must be reported
        with the results.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IGP Topology">
        <t>The Tester emulates a single IGP topology. The DUT establishes IGP
        adjacencies with one or more of the emulated routers in this single
        IGP topology emulated by the Tester. See test topology details in
        <xref target="test_topologies"></xref>. The emulated topology SHOULD
        only be advertised on the DUT egress interfaces.</t>

        <t>The number of IGP routes and number of nodes in the topology, and
        the type of topology will impact the measured IGP convergence time. To
        obtain results similar to those that would be observed in an
        operational network, it is RECOMMENDED that the number of installed
        routes and nodes closely approximate that of the network (e.g.
        thousands of routes with tens or hundreds of nodes).</t>

        <t>The number of areas (for OSPF) and levels (for IS-IS) can impact
        the benchmark results.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Timers">
        <t>There are timers that may impact the measured IGP convergence
        times. The benchmark metrics MAY be measured at any fixed values for
        these timers. To obtain results similar to those that would be
        observed in an operational network, it is RECOMMENDED to configure the
        timers with the values as configured in the operational network.</t>

      <section title="Interface Types">
        <t>All test cases in this methodology document can be executed with
        any interface type. The type of media may dictate which test cases may
        be executed. Each interface type has a unique mechanism for detecting
        link failures and the speed at which that mechanism operates will
        influence the measurement results. All interfaces MUST be the same
        media and Throughput <xref target="Br91"></xref><xref
        target="Br99"></xref> for each test case. All interfaces SHOULD be
        configured as point-to-point.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="test_considerations_offered_load" title="Offered Load">
        <t>The Throughput of the device, as defined in <xref
        target="Br91"></xref> and benchmarked in <xref target="Br99"></xref>
        at a fixed packet size, needs to be determined over the preferred path
        and over the next-best path. The Offered Load SHOULD be the minimum of
        the measured Throughput of the device over the primary path and over
        the backup path. The packet size is selectable and MUST be recorded.
        Packet size is measured in bytes and includes the IP header and
        payload.</t>

        <t>The destination addresses for the Offered Load MUST be distributed
        such that all routes or a statistically representative subset of all
        routes are matched and each of these routes is offered an equal share
        of the Offered Load. It is RECOMMENDED to send traffic matching all
        routes, but a statistically representative subset of all routes can be
        used if required.</t>

        <t>Splitting traffic flows across multiple paths (as with ECMP or
        Parallel Link sets) is in general done by hashing on various fields on
        the IP or contained headers. The hashing is typically based on the IP
        source and destination addresses, the protocol ID, and higher-layer
        flow-dependent fields such as TCP/UDP ports. In practice, within a
        network core, the hashing is based mainly or exclusively on the IP
        source and destination addresses. Knowledge of the hashing algorithm
        used by the DUT is not always possible beforehand, and would violate
        the black-box spirit of this document. Therefor it is RECOMMENDED to
        use a randomly distributed range of source and destination IP
        addresses, protocol IDs, and higher-layer flow-dependent fields for
        the packets of the Offered Load (see also <xref
        target="Ne07"></xref>). The content of the Offered Load MUST remain
        the same during the test. It is RECOMMENDED to repeat a test multiple
        times with different random ranges of the header fields such that
        convergence time benchmarks are measured for different distributions
        of traffic over the available paths.</t>

        forwarding loop that may occur transiently between DUT1 and DUT2
        during convergence (micro-loop, see <xref target="Sh10"></xref>). The
        Time To Live (TTL) or Hop Limit value of the packets sent by the
        Tester may influence the benchmark measurements since it determines
        which device in the topology may send an ICMP Time Exceeded Message
        for looped packets.</t>

        <t>The duration of the Offered Load MUST be greater than the
        convergence time plus the Sustained Convergence Validation Time.</t>

        <t>Offered load should send a packet to each destination before
        sending another packet to the same destination. It is RECOMMENDED that
        the packets be transmitted in a round-robin fashion with a uniform

          Convergence Time and Full Convergence Time. It SHOULD NOT be used to

        </section>

        <section title="Measurement Accuracy">
          <t>The measurement accuracy interval of the Rate-Derived Method
          depends on the metric being measured or calculated and the
          characteristics of the related transition. IP Packet Delay Variation
          (IPDV) <xref target="De02"></xref> adds uncertainty to the amount of
          packets received in a Packet Sampling Interval and this uncertainty
          adds to the measurement error. The effect of IPDV is not accounted
          for in the calculation of the accuracy intervals below. IPDV is of
          importance for the convergence instants were a variation in
          Forwarding Rate needs to be observed (Convergence Recovery Instant
          and for topologies with ECMP also Convergence Event Instant and
          First Route Convergence Instant).</t>

          <t>If the Convergence Event Instant is observed on the dataplane
          using the Rate Derived Method, it needs to be instantaneous for all
          routes (see <xref format="default"
          target="conv_time_no_instant_loss"></xref>). The actual value of the
          Convergence Event Instant falls within the accuracy interval
          [&ndash;(Packet Sampling Interval + 1/Offered Load), +0] around the
          value as measured using the Rate-Derived Method.</t>

          <t>If the Convergence Recovery Transition is non-instantaneous for
          all routes then the actual value of the First Route Convergence
          Instant falls within the accuracy interval [&ndash;(Packet Sampling
          Interval + time between two consecutive packets to the same
          destination), +0] around the value as measured using the
          Rate-Derived Method, and the actual value of the Convergence
          Recovery Instant falls within the accuracy interval [&ndash;(2 *
          Packet Sampling Interval), &ndash;(Packet Sampling Interval - time
          between two consecutive packets to the same destination)] around the
          value as measured using the Rate-Derived Method.</t>

          <t>The term &ldquo;time between two consecutive packets to the same
          destination&rdquo; is added in the above accuracy intervals since
          packets are sent in a particular order to all destinations in a
          stream and when part of the routes experience packet loss, it is
          unknown where in the transmit cycle packets to these routes are
          sent. This uncertainty adds to the error.</t>

          <t>The accuracy intervals of the derived metrics First Route
          Convergence Time and Rate-Derived Convergence Time are calculated

          value of First Route Convergence Time falls within the accuracy
          interval [&ndash;(Packet Sampling Interval + time between two
          consecutive packets to the same destination), +(Packet Sampling
          Interval + 1/Offered Load)] around the calculated value. The actual
          value of Rate-Derived Convergence Time falls within the accuracy
          interval [&ndash;(2 * Packet Sampling Interval), +(time between two

          <t>To measure convergence time, traffic SHOULD start dropping on the
          Preferred Egress Interface on the instant the routes are withdrawn
          by the Tester. Alternatively the Tester SHOULD record the time the
          instant the routes are withdrawn and traffic loss SHOULD only be
          measured on the Next-Best Egress Interface. For loss-derived
          benchmarks the time of the Start Traffic Instant SHOULD be recorded
          as well. See Section <xref format="counter"

          <abstract>
            <t>This RFC specifies an integrated routing protocol, based on the
            OSI Intra-Domain IS-IS Routing Protocol, which may be used as an
            interior gateway protocol (IGP) to support TCP/IP as well as OSI.
            This allows a single routing protocol to be used to support pure
            IP environments, pure OSI environments, and dual environments.
            This specification was developed by the IS-IS working group of the
            Internet Engineering Task Force.</t>

            <t>The OSI IS-IS protocol has reached a mature state, and is ready
            for implementation and operational use. The most recent version of
            the OSI IS-IS protocol is contained in ISO DP 10589. The proposed
            standard for using IS-IS for support of TCP/IP will therefore make
            use of this version (with a minor bug correction, as discussed in
            Annex B). We expect that future versions of this proposed standard
            will upgrade to the final International Standard version of IS-IS
            when available.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This memo documents version 2 of the OSPF protocol. OSPF is a
            link-state routing protocol. It is designed to be run internal to
            a single Autonomous System. Each OSPF router maintains an
            identical database describing the Autonomous System's topology.
            From this database, a routing table is calculated by constructing
            a shortest- path tree.</t>

            <t>OSPF recalculates routes quickly in the face of topological
            changes, utilizing a minimum of routing protocol traffic. OSPF
            provides support for equal-cost multipath. An area routing
            capability is provided, enabling an additional level of routing
            protection and a reduction in routing protocol traffic. In
            addition, all OSPF routing protocol exchanges are
            authenticated.</t>

            <t>The differences between this memo and RFC 2178 are explained in
            Appendix G. All differences are backward-compatible in nature.
            Implementations of this memo and of RFCs 2178, 1583, and 1247 will
            interoperate.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This document describes the modifications to OSPF to support
            version 6 of the Internet Protocol (IPv6). The fundamental
            mechanisms of OSPF (flooding, Designated Router (DR) election,
            area support, Short Path First (SPF) calculations, etc.) remain
            unchanged. However, some changes have been necessary, either due
            to changes in protocol semantics between IPv4 and IPv6, or simply
            to handle the increased address size of IPv6. These modifications
            will necessitate incrementing the protocol version from version 2
            to version 3. OSPF for IPv6 is also referred to as OSPF version 3
            (OSPFv3).&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; Changes between OSPF for IPv4, OSPF
            Version 2, and OSPF for IPv6 as described herein include the
            following. Addressing semantics have been removed from OSPF
            packets and the basic Link State Advertisements (LSAs). New LSAs
            have been created to carry IPv6 addresses and prefixes. OSPF now
            runs on a per-link basis rather than on a per-IP-subnet basis.
            Flooding scope for LSAs has been generalized. Authentication has
            been removed from the OSPF protocol and instead relies on IPv6's
            Authentication Header and Encapsulating Security Payload
            (ESP).&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; Even with larger IPv6 addresses, most
            packets in OSPF for IPv6 are almost as compact as those in OSPF
            for IPv4. Most fields and packet- size limitations present in OSPF
            for IPv4 have been relaxed. In addition, option handling has been
            made more flexible.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; All of OSPF for IPv4's
            optional capabilities, including demand circuit support and
            Not-So-Stubby Areas (NSSAs), are also supported in OSPF for IPv6.

            information using the IS-IS routing protocol. The described method
            utilizes two new TLVs: a reachability TLV and an interface address
            TLV to distribute the necessary IPv6 information throughout a
            routing domain. Using this method, one can route IPv6 along with
            IPv4 and OSI using a single intra-domain routing protocol.

          <abstract>
            <t>A micro-loop is a packet forwarding loop that may occur
            transiently among two or more routers in a hop-by-hop packet
            forwarding paradigm.</t>

            <t>This framework provides a summary of the causes and
            consequences of micro-loops and enables the reader to form a
            judgement on whether micro-looping is an issue that needs to be
            addressed in specific networks. It also provides a survey of the
            currently proposed mechanisms that may be used to prevent or to
            suppress the formation of micro-loops when an IP or MPLS network
            undergoes topology change due to failure, repair, or management
            action. When sufficiently fast convergence is not available and
            the topology is susceptible to micro-loops, use of one or more of
            these mechanisms may be desirable. This document is not an
            Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for

          <abstract>
            <t>Test engineers take pains to declare all factors that affect a
            given measurement, including intended load, packet length, test
            duration, and traffic orientation. However, current benchmarking
            practice overlooks two factors that have a profound impact on test
            results. First, existing methodologies do not require the
            reporting of addresses or other test traffic contents, even though
            these fields can affect test results. Second, "stuff" bits and
            bytes inserted in test traffic by some link-layer technologies add
            significant and variable overhead, which in turn affects test
            results. This document describes the effects of these factors;
            recommends guidelines for test traffic contents; and offers
            formulas for determining the probability of bit- and byte-stuffing
            in test traffic. This memo provides information for the Internet

            <t>This document discusses the applicability of various tests for
            measuring single router control plane convergence, specifically in
            regard to the Open Shortest First (OSPF) protocol. There are two
            general sections in this document, the first discusses advantages
            and limitations of specific OSPF convergence tests, and the second
            discusses more general pitfalls to be considered when routing
            protocol convergence is tested. This memo provides information for
            the Internet community.</t>

            <t>This document provides a framework for the development of IP
            fast- reroute mechanisms that provide protection against link or
            router failure by invoking locally determined repair paths. Unlike
            MPLS fast-reroute, the mechanisms are applicable to a network
            employing conventional IP routing and forwarding. This document is
            not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
            informational purposes.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This document defines RSVP-TE extensions to establish backup
            label-switched path (LSP) tunnels for local repair of LSP tunnels.
            These mechanisms enable the re-direction of traffic onto backup
            LSP tunnels in 10s of milliseconds, in the event of a failure.</t>

            <t>Two methods are defined here. The one-to-one backup method
            creates detour LSPs for each protected LSP at each potential point
            of local repair. The facility backup method creates a bypass
            tunnel to protect a potential failure point; by taking advantage
            of MPLS label stacking, this bypass tunnel can protect a set of
            LSPs that have similar backup constraints. Both methods can be
            used to protect links and nodes during network failure. The
            described behavior and extensions to RSVP allow nodes to implement
            either method or both and to interoperate in a mixed network.

Abstract 
    
   This document presents a set of requirements for providing a Point-
   to-Multipoint PWE3 (Pseudowire Emulation Edge to Edge) emulation. The 
   requirements identified in this document are related to architecture, 
   signaling and maintenance aspects of a Point-to-Multipoint PW 
   operation. They are proposed as guidelines for the standardization of 
   such mechanisms. Among other potential applications Point-to-
   Multipoint PWs SHOULD be used to optimize the support of multicast 
   services (Virtual Private LAN Service and Virtual Private Multicast 
   Service) as defined in the Layer 2 Virtual Private Network working 
   group.

1. Introduction 
    
1.1. Problem Statement 
    
   As defined in the PWE3 WG charter, a Pseudowire (PW) emulates a 
   point-to-point bidirectional link over an IP/MPLS network, and 
   provides a single service which is perceived by its user as an 
   unshared link or circuit of the chosen service. A Pseudowire is used 
   to transport non IP traffic (e.g. Ethernet, TDM, ATM, and FR) in an 
   IP/MPLS-based PSN (Packet Switched Network). PWE3 operates "edge to 
   edge" to provide the required connectivity between the two endpoints 
   of the PW. 
    
   The P2MP topology mentioned in [VPMS REQ] and required to provide 
   P2MP L2VPN services can be achieved via a P2MP PW. The use of PW 
   becomes necessary for some P2MP services requiring specific 
   encapsulation capabilities. This could be achieved using a set of 
   point to point PWs, with traffic replication on the PE, but faces 
   obvious bandwidth limitation issues, as traffic is carried multiple 
   time on shared links.  
    
   This document defines the requirements for the use of a Point-to-
   Multipoint PW (P2MP PW). A Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Pseudowire (PW) 
   is a mechanism that emulates the essential attributes of a P2MP 
   Telecommunications service such as P2MP ATM over PSN. One of the 
   applicabilities of a P2MP PW is to deliver a non-IP multicast service 
   that carries multicast frames from a multicast source to one or more 
   multicast receivers. The required functions of P2MP PWs include 
   encapsulating service-specific PDUs arriving at an ingress Attachment 
   Circuit (AC), and carrying them across a tunnel to one or more egress 
   ACs, managing their timing and order, and any other operations 
   required to emulate the behavior and characteristics of the service 
   as faithfully as possible.

Internet Draft           P2MP PW Requirements            January 2010 
                                     

   P2MP PWs extend the PWE3 architecture [RFC3985] to offer a P2MP 
   Telecommunications service.  
   This document aims at defining the associated requirements related to 
   the P2MP PW operation (e.g. setup and maintenance, protection, 
   scalability). 
    
    
1.2. Scope of the document 
    
   The document describes the P2MP PW Reference Model architectures and 
   outlines specific signaling requirements for the set up and 
   maintenance of a P2MP PW. The requirements are divided into two 
   parts, i.e. those applicable in a Single-Segment topology and those 
   applicable in a Multi-Segment topology. For other aspects of P2MP PW 
   implementation like packet processing (section 4) and Faithfulness of 
   Emulated Services (section 7), the document refers to [RFC3916].  
    
   Some P2MP PW requirements are derived from the signaling requirements 
   for P2MP Traffic-Engineered MPLS Label Switched Paths [RFC4461].

2.2. Terminology 
    
   This document uses terminology described in [RFC5254], [RFC5659]. 
    
   It also introduces additional terms needed in the context of P2MP PW. 
    
   P2MP PW, (also referred as PW Tree) 
    
   Point-to-Multipoint Pseudowire. A PW attached to a source used to 
   distribute L1/L2 format traffic to a set of one or more receivers (or 
   leaves). The P2MP PW is unidirectional and optionally bidirectional. 
    
   P2MP SS-PW 
    
   Point-to-Multipoint Single-Segment Pseudowire. A single segment P2MP 
   PW set up between the PE attached to the source and the PEs attached 
   to the receivers. The P2MP SS-PW relies on P2MP LSP as PSN tunnel.

   P2MP MS-PW 
    
   Point-to-Multipoint Multi-Segment Pseudowire. A multi-segment P2MP PW 
   represents an End-to-End PW segmented by means of S-PEs which are in 
   charge of switching the PW label. Each segment can rely on either  
   P2P LSP or P2MP LSP as PSN tunnel.  
      
   Root PE 
    
   P2MP PW Root Provider Edge. Router attached to a Customer Equipment 
   (traffic source) via an Attachment Circuit (AC). In a MS-PW 
   architecture the term used is Root T-PE. 
    
   Leaf PE 
    
   P2MP PW Leaf Provider Edge. Router attached to a set of one or more 
   Customer Equipments (traffic receivers or leaves). The P2MP PW is 
   attached to an Attachment Circuit (AC). The Leaf PE is therefore in 
   charge of replicating the traffic over the CEs based on its Forwarder 
   function [RFC3985].  
    
   Branch S-PE 
    
   The Branch S-PE is only defined and required in the context of MS-PW. 
   The Branch S-PE has one upstream PW (P2P or P2MP) segment and one or 
   several downstream PW (P2P or P2MP) segments. 
    
   P2MP PSN Tunnel 
    
   In the P2MP SS-PW topology, The PSN Tunnel is a general term 
   indicating a virtual P2MP connection between the Root PE and the Leaf 
   PEs. A P2MP tunnel may potentially carry multiple P2MP PWs inside 
   (aggregation). This document uses terminology from the document 
   describing the MPLS multicast architecture [RFC5332] for MPLS PSN. 
    
    
3. P2MP SS-PW Requirements 
    
3.1. P2MP SS-PW Reference Model 
    
   A P2MP SS-PW provides a Point-to-Multipoint connectivity from a Root 
   PE connected to a traffic source to at least two Leaf PEs connected 
   to traffic receivers. The PW endpoints connect the PW to its 
   Attachment Circuit (AC). As for a P2P PW, an AC can be a Frame Relay 
   DLC, an ATM VP/VC, an Ethernet port, a VLAN, a HDLC link on a 
   physical interface.  
    
    
   Figure 1 describes the P2MP SS-PW reference model which is derived 
   from [RFC3985] to support P2MP emulated services.

   This architecture applies to the case where a P2MP PSN tunnel extends 
   between edge nodes of a single PSN domain to transport a 
   unidirectional P2MP PW with endpoints at these edge nodes. 
   In this model a single copy of each PW packet is sent over the P2MP 
   PSN tunnel and is received by all Leaf PEs due to the P2MP nature of 
   the PSN tunnel. P2MP PW MUST be traffic optimised, only one copy of 
   P2MP PW packet on one single link. P Router is joining P2MP PSN 
   tunnel operation but is not participating in the signaling of P2MP 
   PW. P2MP PW operation is associated with PE1, PE2, PE3 and PE4. 
    
   Specifics operations that must be perfomed at the PE on the native 
   data units are not described here since the required pre-processing 
   (Forwarder (FWRD) and Native Service Processing (NSP)) defined in the 
   section 4.2 [RFC3985] are also applicable to P2MP PW. 
 
    
   In nature the P2MP PW is unidirectional, but it may be required for a 
   Root PE to receive unidirectional P2P traffic from any Leaf PE. For 
   that purpose the P2MP PW MAY support OPTIONAL bidirectional 
   connectivity between the Root PE and each Leaf PE 
   - Downstream: Point-to-Multipoint (Root PE to any Leaf PE) 
   - Upstream: Point-to-Point (any Leaf PE to Root PE)

3.2. P2MP SS-PW Underlying Layer 
    
   The P2MP SS-PW implies an underlying P2MP PSN tunnel. Figure 2 gives 
   an example of P2MP SS-PW topology relying on a P2MP LSP. The PW tree 
   is composed of one Root PE (i1) and several Leaf PEs (e1, e2, e3, 
   e4).   
    
   The P2MP PSN MAY be signaled with P2MP RSVP-TE [RFC4875] or MLDP 
   [MLDP].

         Figure 2 Example of P2MP Underlying Layer for P2MP SS-PW 
    
    
   The P2MP PW MAY be supported over multiple P2MP PSN tunnel. These 
   P2MP PSN tunnels MUST be able to serve more than one P2MP PW. 
    
   The P2MP Tunnels MAY also be of different technology (ex. MPLS over 
   GRE, or P-to-MP MPLS LSP ) or just use different setup protocols. 
   (ex. MLDP, and P2MP RSVP-TE ). 
    
   The P2MP LSP associated to the P2MP PW can be selected either by user 
   configuration or by dynamically using the multiplexing/demultiplexing 
   mechanism. 
    
   The P2MP PW multiplexing will be based on the overlap rate between 
   P2MP LSP and P2MP PW. The operator should determine whether the P2MP 
   PW can accept partially multiplexing with P2MP LSP, and a minimum 
   congruency rate may be defined. The congruency rate reflects the 
   amount of overlap in the Leaf PE of P2MP PW that is multiplexed to a 
   P2MP LSP. If there is a complete overlap, the congruency is perfect 
   and the rate is 100%. The Root PE can determine whether P2MP PW can 
   multiplex to a P2MP LSP according to the congruency rate. It is also 
   possible to extend P2MP LSP to do P2MP PW multiplexing, but this will 
   reduce the current congruency rate that the P2MP PW is currently 
   taken. The multiplexing should ensure that the P2MP PW congruency 
   that is currently taken under P2MP LSP should be larger than minimum 
   congruency that is configured. 
    
   With this procedure a P2MP PW is nested within a P2MP LSP. This 
   allows multiplexing several PWs over a common P2MP LSP. Prior to the

   will be used for this P2MP PW. The PSN Tunnel can be an existing PSN 
   tunnel or the Root PE can create a new P2MP PSN tunnel.  
    
    
    
3.3. P2MP SS-PW Construction 
    
   As initial step PE nodes have to be configured with P2MP PW 
   identifier and ACs. 
   Then discovery mechanism SHOULD allow PE to discover remote PEs 
   configuration. 
   Eventually the solution SHOULD allow single-sided operation at the 
   Root PE for the selection of some AC(s) at the Leaf PE(s) to be 
   attached to the PW tree so that the Root PE controls the Leaf 
   attachment. 
   Note that the Root PE single sided operation is a management 
   requirement and does not presume any signaling requirement. 
    
   The Root PE SHOULD support a method to be informed about the Leaf PE 
   successfully attached to the PW tree. 
    
    
    
3.4. P2MP SS-PW Signaling Requirements 
    
3.4.1. PW Identifier 
    
   The P2MP PW MUST be uniquely identified. This unique P2MP PW 
   identifier MUST be used for all the signaling procedure related to 
   this PW (PW setup, monitoring). 
    
3.4.2. PW type mismatch 
    
   As for P2P PW, the ACs configured at Root PE and Leaf PEs of a P2MP 
   PW MUST be of the same PW type [RFC4446]. In case of a different 
   type, the passive PE (Root or Leaf PE, depending on the signaling 
   process) MUST support mechanisms to reject attempts to establish the 
   P2MP PW. 
 
3.4.3. Interface Parameters sub-TLV 
    
   Some interface parameters [RFC4446] related to the AC capability have 
   been defined according to the PW type and are signaled during the PW 
   setup. 
   When applicable, this mechanism used for the P2P PW setup MUST be 
   enhanced for P2MP PW setup so as to ascertain that AC at the Leaf PE 
   is capable to support traffic coming from AC at the Root PE.  
    
   In case of mismatch, the passive PE (Ingress or Leaf PE, depending on 
   the signaling process) MUST support mechanisms to reject attempts to 
   establish the P2MP SS-PW.

    3.4.4. Leaf Grafting/Pruning 
    
   Once the PW tree is setup, the solution MUST allow the addition or 
   removal of a Leaf PE, or a subset of leaves to/from the existing 
   tree, without any impact on the PW tree (data and control planes) for 
   the remaining leaf PEs.  
   The addition or removal of a Leaf PE MUST also allow to the P2MP PSN 
   tunnel to be updated accordingly. This MAY cause P2MP PSN tunnel to 
   add or remove the corresponding Leaf PE.  
    
    
3.5. Failure Detection and Reporting 
    
   Since the underlying layer has an End-to-End P2MP topology between 
   the Root PE and the Leaf PEs, the failure reporting and processing 
   procedures are implemented only on the edge nodes. 
    
   Failure events MAY cause one or more Leaf PEs to become detached from 
   the PW tree. These events MUST be reported to the Root PE, using 
   appropriate out-band or inband OAM messages.  
   The solution SHOULD allow the Root PE to be informed of Leaf PEs 
   failure for management purposes. 
    
   Based on these failure notifications the solution MUST allow the Root 
   PE to update the remaining leaves of the PW tree. 
    
   - A solution MUST support in-band OAM mechanism to detect failures: 
   unidirectional point-to-multipoint traffic failure. This SHOULD be 
   realized by enhancing existing unicast PW methods, such as VCCV for 
   seamless and familiar operation. 
    
   - In case of failure, it SHOULD correctly report which Leaf PEs are 
   affected. This SHOULD be realized by enhancing existing PW methods, 
   such as LDP Notification for seamless and familiar operation. The 
   notification message SHOULD include the type of fault (P2MP PW, AC or 
   PSN tunnel). 
    
   - Respectively a Leaf PE also MAY receive the status of the Root PE's 
   AC status. 
    
   - A solution MUST support OAM message mapping at the Root PE if 
   failure is detected on the AC. The Leaf PE MUST report accordingly at 
   the service layer this OAM message on its associated AC.  
    
    
3.6. Protection and Restoration 
    
   It is assumed that if recovery procedures are required the P2MP PSN 
   tunnel will support standard MPLS-based recovery techniques 
   (typically based on RSVP-TE). In that case a mechanism SHOULD be

   implemented to avoid race conditions between recovery at the PSN 
   level and recovery at the PW level. 
    
   An alternative protection scheme MAY rely on the PW layer. 
    
     
   Leaf PEs MAY be protected via a P2MP PW redundancy mechanism. In the 
   example depicted below, a standby P2MP PW is used to protect the 
   active P2MP. In that protection scheme the AC at the Root PE MUST 
   serve both P2MP PWs. In this scenario, the condition when to do the 
   switchover should be implemented, e.g. one or all Leaf failure of 
   active P2MP PW will course P2MP PW switchover.

3.7. Scalability 
    
   The solution SHOULD scale at least as well as linearly with an 
   increase in the number of Leaf PEs.  
    
   An increase in the number of P2MP PW SHOULD NOT cause the P router to 
   increase its forwarding table linearly.  
    
   The P2MP PW multiplexed/demultiplexed to P2MP PSN Tunnel can improve 
   the scalability.

Internet Draft           P2MP PW Requirements            January 2010 
                                     

   Figure 3 extends the P2MP SS-PW architecture of Figure 1 to a multi-
   segment configuration. In a P2P MS-PW configuration as described in 
   [RFC5254] the S-PE is responsible to switch a MS-PW from one input 
   segment to only one output segment, based on the PW identifier. Here 
   in a P2MP MS-PW configuration the S-PE is responsible to switch a MS-
   PW from one input segment to one or several output segments.  
    
   Referring to Figure 3 T-PE1 is the Root T-PE and T-PE2, T-PE3, T-PE4 
   and T-PE5 are the Leaf T-PEs. In the reference model, the Leaf T-PEs 
   are assumed to be located in the same PSN (PSN2), but it could be 
   envisioned that each output PW is located in a different PSN (PSN2, 
   PSN3, PSN4). The S-PE plays the role of Branch S-PE since S-PE1 and 
   S-PE are in charge respectively of switching simultaneously the input 
   P2MP PW1 segment to the output P2P PW2, P2P PW3 and P2MP PW4 
   segments.  
    
   A P2MP MS-PW MAY obviously transit through more than one S-PE along 
   its path. 
    
   As depicted in the Figure 3 a PW segment belonging to a P2MP MS-PW 
   can also be supported over a P2MP PSN tunnel or a P2P PSN tunnel. 
    
4.2. P2MP SS-PW Underlying Layer 
    
   Figure 4 describes an example of P2MP MS-PW topology relying on a 
   combination of both P2P and P2MP LSPs as PSN tunnels. PW segment over 
   P2P LSP MAY address inter-provider requirement. The PW tree is 
   composed of one Root PE (i1) and several Leaf PEs (e1, e2, e3, e4). 
   The Branch S-PEs are represented as b1, b2, b3, b4, b5. In that case 
   the traffic replication along the path of the PW tree is performed at 
   the PW level. For instance the Branch S-PE b5 MUST replicate incoming 
   packets or data received from b2 and send them to Leaf T-PEs e3 and 
   e4. 
    
   However giving the fact that some PW segments MAY be supported over a 
   P2MP LSP, the traffic replication along the path of these PW segments 
   can be performed as well at the underlying LSP level. 
    
   Figure 4 describes the case where each segment is supported over a 
   P2P LSP except for the b1-b3b4 P2MP segment which is conveyed over a 
   P2MP LSP on this section.

     Figure 4 Example of P2P and P2MP underlying Layer for P2MP MS-PW 
                                      
    
   The P2MP PSN MAY be signaled with P2MP RSVP-TE [RFC4875] or MLDP 
   [MLDP]. 
    
    
4.3. P2MP MS-PW Signaling Requirements 
    
4.3.1. Dynamically Instantiated P2MP MS-PW 
    
   The PW tree could be statically configured at the T-PEs and each S-PE 
   crossed. However it is RECOMMENDED that a solution provides the 
   ability to dynamically setup a MS-PW tree, by allowing the MS-PW 
   segments to be dynamically discovered. 
    
   During the PW tree setup, a Branch S-PE SHOULD be capable to inform 
   the upstream PEs, including the Root T-PE that a set of Leaf T-PEs 
   and associated leaves are not reachable.  
    
    
4.3.2. P2MP MS-PW Setup Mechanisms 
    
   The requirements described in this section assume that dynamic setup 
   of MS-PW segments allows the T-PE and S-PEs to dynamically signal MS-
   PW segments and stitch these segments in order to build the MS-PW 
   tree. 
    
    
4.3.3. PW type mismatch 
    
   As described for P2MP SS-PW, the P2MP MS-PW requires ACs of the same 
   PW type. Therefore the segments composing the P2MP MS-PW MUST be also 
   of the same PW type [RFC4446]. The S-PE MAY only support switching 
   PWs of the same PW type. In case of a different type, the passive PE 
   (S-PE or T-PE) MUST support mechanisms to reject attempts to 
   establish the P2MP MS-PW. 
    
    
4.3.4. Interface Parameters sub-TLV 
    
   The section 3.4.3 is also relevant to P2MP MS-PW. When applicable, 
   the Leaf T-PE or the Root T-PE MUST signal respectively its AC' 
   interface parameters to the Root T-PE or to the Leaf T-PE so as to 
   make sure that AC at the Leaf T-PE is capable to support traffic 
   coming from AC at the Root T-PE. In the P2MP MS-PW case, S-PEs MUST 
   propagate correctly this information.  
   In case of mismatch, the passive T-PE (Root or Leaf T-PE, depending 
   on the signaling process) MUST support mechanisms to reject attempts 
   to establish the P2MP MS-PW.

4.3.5. Leaf Grafting/Pruning 
    
   Once the PW tree is setup, the solution MUST allow the addition or 
   removal of a Leaf T-PE, or a subset of leaves to/from the existing 
   tree, without any impact on the PW tree (data and control planes) for 
   the remaining Leaf T-PEs. 
    
4.3.6. Explicit Routing 
    
   The P2MP MS-PW signaling solution MUST provide a means of 
   establishing arbitrary P2MP MS-PW, according to pre-computed and 
   configured S-PE paths as well as dynamically computed S-PE paths on 
   the Root T-PE.   
      
   To support setup of explicitly routed MS-PW tree, the signaling 
   solution SHOULD support some source-based control that can explicitly 
   define particular S-PE nodes as Branch S-PEs for the PW tree. 
    
   The solution SHOULD let possible Explicit Path Loose Hops. Therefore 
   the P2MP MS-PW MAY be partially specified with only a subset of 
   intermediate Branch S-PEs. 
    
    
4.4. Failure Detection and Reporting 
    
   The solution SHOULD rely on specific OAM mechanisms to detect a node 
   (T-PE and S-PE) or segment failure of a PW tree. The solution SHOULD 
   also support the ability to inform the Root T-PE of the failure as 
   well as to indicate the identity of affected Leaf T-PEs. 
    
   Based on these failure notifications the solution MUST allow the Root 
   T-PE to update the remaining Leaf T-PEs of the PW tree. 
    
   - A solution MUST support in-band OAM mechanism to detect failures: 
   unidirectional point-to-multipoint traffic failure. This SHOULD be 
   realized by enhancing existing unicast PW methods, such as VCCV for 
   seamless and familiar operation. 
    
   - In case of failure, it SHOULD correctly report which Leaf T-PEs and 
   Branch S-PEs are affected. This SHOULD be realized by enhancing 
   existing unicast PW methods, such as LDP Notification for seamless 
   and familiar operation. The notification message SHOULD include the 
   type of fault (P2MP PW, AC or PSN tunnel). 
    
   - Respectively a Leaf T-PE also MAY receive the status of the Root 
   PE's AC status. 
    
   - A solution MUST support OAM message mapping at the Root T-PE if 
   failure is detected on the AC. The Leaf T-PE MUST report accordingly 
   at the service layer this OAM message on its associated AC.

Internet Draft           P2MP PW Requirements            January 2010 
                                     

4.5. Protection and Restoration 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide mechanisms to recover as fast as possible 
   following a failure event. The fast protection/recovery is typically 
   dedicated to P2MP applications sensitive to traffic disruption.   
    
   Considering (i) a Root-initiated PW tree setup and (ii) that a local 
   repair (PSN-tunnel or PW segment-based) is not feasible after a 
   failure event and that (iii) the PE upstream to the failure receives 
   by means of OAM mechanisms a message indicating that a subset of Leaf 
   T-PEs are detached from the PW tree, the solution SHOULD allow the 
   upstream PE to re-compute the path to those particular Leaf T-PEs. If 
   the upstream PE failed to compute an alternative path, the procedure 
   SHOULD be propagated upstream until the Root T-PE is reached. 
    
   It is also assumed that recovery procedures can be implemented at the 
   underlying P2P or P2MP LSP layer, using standard MPLS-based recovery 
   techniques. These procedures could be used to provide faster recovery 
   time in case of link or node failure affecting this layer. 
    
   A mechanism SHOULD be implemented to avoid race conditions between 
   recovery at the PSN level and recovery at the PW level. 
    
    
4.6. Scalability 
    
   In definition of solution for P2MP MS-PW a particular attention MUST 
   be dedicated to scalability. 
    
   The solution MUST be designed to scale as well as linearly with an 
   increase in the number of Leaf T-PEs, Branch S-PEs. The scalability 
   issues MUST be addressed for the control plane (e.g. addressing of PW 
   endpoints, number of signaling sessions, etc) and for data plane 
   (e.g. duplication of PW segments, OAM mechanism, etc). 
    
    
    
5. Manageability considerations 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide a simple provisioning procedure to build 
   a P2MP SS-PW or a P2MP MS-PW.  
    
   The solution MUST take into consideration the situation where the 
   Root PE and Leaf PEs are not managed by a single NMS.  
    
   In that case it MUST be possible to manage the whole P2MP PW using a 
   single NMS. Typically the P2MP PW could be managed from the Root PE.

Internet Draft           P2MP PW Requirements            January 2010 
                                     

6. Backward Compatibility 
    
    
   The solution SHOULD be completely backward compatible with 
   the current PW standards. The solution SHOULD take into account the 
   capability advertisement and negotiation procedures for the PEs 
   implementing P2MP PW endpoints. 
    
   Implementation of OAM mechanisms also implies the advertisement of PE 
   capabilities to support specific OAM features. The solution MAY allow 
   advertising P2MP PW OAM capabilities. 
    
    
   A solution MUST NOT allow PW connection with non-compliant PEs.  It 
   MUST have a mechanism to report an error for non-compliant PEs.  In 
   this case, it SHOULD report which PE (S-PE and T-PEs) are not 
   compliant.  
    
   In some cases, upstream traffic is required from downstream CE to 
   upstream CE. The P2MPPW solution SHOULD allow a return path (i.e. 
   from the Leaf to the Root) that provides upstream connection. 
   In particular, it is expected to be allowed that the same ACs are 
   shared between downstream and upstream direction. For downstream, a 
   CE receives from its connected AC traffic originated by the Root PE 
   transported over a P2MP PW.  For upstream, the CE MAY also send over 
   the same AC traffic destined to the same remote PE. 
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   The security requirements common to PW are raised in Section 10 of 
   [RFC3916] and common to MS-PW in section 7 of [RFC5254]. P2MP PW (SS 
   or MS) is a variant of the initial P2P PW definition, and that 
   statements also apply to P2MP PW. 
    
    
8. IANA Considerations 
    
   This draft does not define any new protocol element, and hence does 
   not require any IANA action.

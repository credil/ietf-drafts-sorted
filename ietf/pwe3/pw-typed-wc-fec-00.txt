Abstract 

   The "Typed Wildcard Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) Element" 
   defines an extension to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) that 
   can be used when it is desired to request or withdraw or release all 
   label bindings for a given FEC Element type.  However, a typed 
   wildcard FEC element must be individually defined for each FEC 
   element type.  This specification defines the typed wildcard FEC 
   elements for the PWid (0x80), Generalized PWid (0x81), and P2MP PW 
   (0x82) FEC element types.

1. Introduction 

   An extension [RFC5918] to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) 
   [RFC5036] defines the general notion of a "Typed Wildcard Forwarding 
   Equivalence Class (FEC) Element".  This can be used when it is 
   desired to request all label bindings for a given type of FEC 
   Element, or to release or withdraw all label bindings for a given 
   type of FEC element.  However, a typed wildcard FEC element must be 
   individually defined for each type of FEC element. 

   [RFC4447] defines the "PWid FEC Element" and "Generalized PWid FEC 
   Element", and [P2MP-PW] defines the "P2MP PW FEC Element". These 
   specifications, however, do not specify the Typed Wildcard format 
   for these elements. This document specifies the format of the Typed 
   Wildcard FEC Element for the "PWid FEC Element", "Generalized PWid 
   FEC Element", and "P2MP FEC Element". The procedures for Typed 
   Wildcard processing for PWid, Generalized PWid, and P2MP FEC 
   Elements are same as described in [RFC5918] for any typed wildcard 
   FEC Element type. 

2. Typed Wildcard for PW FEC Elements 

   The format of the Typed Wildcard FEC Element for PWid, Generalized 
   PWid, and P2MP PW FEC Elements is specified as: 

    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |Typed Wcard=0x5| Type=PW FEC   |   Len = 2     |R|   PW type   | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |    . . .      |

      Typed Wcard (one octet): Typed Wildcard FEC element type (0x05) 
           as specified in [RFC5918]

        PWid: (type 0x80 [RFC4447])

        P2MP PW: (type 0x82, [P2MP-PW]

      Len [FEC Type Info] (one octet):  Two. (i.e. there is additional 
           FEC info to scope the Typed Wildcard) 

      Reserved bit: Must be set to ZERO on transmit and ignored on 
           receipt. 

      PW type (15-bits): PW type as specified in [RFC4447]. This field 
           is used to scope the PWid wildcard FEC operation to limit to 
           all PWs of a given type. This MUST be set to 0x7FFF 
           (Wildcard PW [IANA-PWE3]) when referring PWs of all types 
           (see Section 7).  

  [RFC4447] defines "PW Grouping ID TLV" that can be used for wildcard 
  withdrawal or status messages related to Generalized PWid and P2MP PW 
  FECs. When Typed Wildcard FEC for Generalized PWid or P2MP PW FEC 
  element is in use, "PW Grouping ID TLV" MUST NOT be present in the 
  same message. If found present, receiving LSR MUST silently ignore 
  Grouping ID TLV and process rest of the message. 
 
3. Applicability Statement 

   The Typed wildcard FEC Elements defined in this document for the 
   PWid, Generalized PWid, and P2MP PW FEC Elements provide a finer 
   degree of granularity when compared to the Wildcard FEC mechanics 
   defined in [RFC5036]. 

   The PWid FEC Element as defined in [RFC4447] contains a Group ID 
   field. This field is defined as an arbitrary 32-bit value that 
   represents a group of PWs, and is used to create groups in the PW 
   space, including potentially a single group of all PWs for a given 
   FEC Element. This grouping enables an LSR to send wildcard label 
   withdrawals and/or status notification messages corresponding to a 
   PW group upon physical port failures. Similarly, [RFC4447] defines 
   the "PW Grouping ID TLV" used in the same fashion for the 
   Generalized PWid and P2MP PW FEC Elements.  

  The PW Typed Wildcard FEC elements defined in this document help us 
  achieve the similar functionality as "Group ID" field or "PW Grouping 
  ID TLV" for label withdrawal and status notification messages; 
  Additionally, the Typed Wildcard procedures [RFC5918] also provide 
  more generalized and comprehensive solution by allowing: 
  1. Typed-Wildcard Label Request message 



 
 
Raza, et. al            Expires December 2011                  [Page 4] 
    
  Internet-Draft       LDP Typed Wildcard PW FEC Elements    June 2011 
    

  2. Label TLV to further constraint the wildcard to all FECs of the 
      specified FEC type [and its specific filter] that are also bound 
      to the specified label.  
 
4. Operation 

   The use of Typed Wildcard FEC elements for PW can be useful under 
   several scenarios. This section describes two use cases to 
   illustrate their usage. The following use cases consider two LSR 
   nodes, A and B, with LDP session between them to exchange L2VPN PW 
   bindings. 

4.1. PW Consistency Check 

   A user may request a control plane consistency check at LSR A for 
   the PWid FEC and Generalized PWid FEC bindings that it had learnt 
   from LSR B over LDP session.  To perform this consistency check, LSR 
   A marks all its learnt PW bindings from LSR B as stale, and then 
   send a Label Request message towards LSR B with Typed Wildcard FEC 
   element for PWid FEC element (PW type = 0x7FFF) and Generalized PWid 
   FEC element (PW type = 0x7FFF). Upon receipt of such request, LSR B 
   replays its database related to PWid FEC elements and Generalized 
   PWid FEC element in Label Mapping message. As a PW binding is 
   received at LSR A, the associated binding state is marked as 
   refreshed (no stale).  When replay completes for a given type of 
   FEC, LSR B sends End-of-LIB Notification [RFC5919] to mark the end 
   of update for the given FEC type. Upon receipt of this Notification 
   at LSR A, any remaining stale PW binding of given FEC type learnt 
   from the peer LSR B, is cleaned up and removed from the database. 
   This completes consistency check with LSR B at LSR A for given FEC 
   type. 

4.2. PW Graceful Shutdown 

   It may be desirable to perform shutdown/removal of existing PW 
   bindings advertised towards a peer in a graceful manner -- i.e. all 
   advertised PW bindings to be removed from a peer without session 
   flap.  For example, to request a graceful delete of the PWid FEC and 
   Generalized PWid FEC bindings at LSR A learnt from LSR B, LSR A 
   would send a Label Withdraw message towards LSR B with Typed 
   Wildcard FEC elements pertaining to PWid FEC element (PW type = 
   0x7FFF) and Generalized PWid FEC element (PW type = 0x7FFF). Upon 
   receipt of such message, LSR B will delete all PWid and Generalized 
   PWid bindings learnt from LSR A. Afterwards, LSR B would send Label 
   Release message corresponding to received Label Withdraw with Typed 
   FEC element.

  Internet-Draft       LDP Typed Wildcard PW FEC Elements    June 2011 
    

4.3. Wildcard PW Status 

  The Typed Wildcard FEC Elements for PW FECs can be very useful when 
  used to convey PW status amongst LSRs. The PE devices can send "PW 
  Status TLV" in an LDP Notification message to indicate status (i.e., 
  a Pseudowire Status Code denoting for example a particular fault) to 
  their remote peers [RFC4447]. In case of a global failure affecting 
  all PWs, an LSR typically sends one PW Status Notification message 
  per PW. Using Typed Wildcard FEC Element for given type of PW FEC 
  Element, the LSR will need to send only one PW Status Notification 
  message with Typed Wildcard PW FEC specified to notify about the 
  common status applicable to all PWs as scoped by the PW Typed 
  Wildcard FEC. 
 
5. Security Considerations 

  No new security considerations beyond that apply to the base LDP 
  specification [RFC5036], [RFC4447] and [MPLS_SEC] apply to the use of 
  the PW Typed Wildcard FEC Element types described in this document. 
   
6. IANA Considerations 

  None.

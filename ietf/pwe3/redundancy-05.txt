Abstract 
  This document describes a framework comprised of a number of 
  scenarios and associated requirements for pseudowire (PW) 
  redundancy. A set of redundant PWs is configured between provider 
  edge (PE) nodes in single segment PW applications, or between 
  Terminating PE nodes in Multi-Segment PW applications. In order for 
  the PE/T-PE nodes to indicate the preferred PW to use for forwarding 
  PW packets to one another, a new PW status is required to indicate 
  the preferential forwarding status of active or standby for each PW 
  in the redundancy set.

1. Introduction 
  The objective of PW redundancy is to provide sparing of attachment 
  circuits (ACs), Provider Edge nodes (PEs), and Pseudowires (PWs) to 
  eliminate single points of failure, while ensuring that only one 
  active path between a pair of Customer Edge nodes (CEs).  
  In single-segment PW (SS-PW) applications, protection for the PW is 
  provided by the PSN layer. This may be a Resource Reservation 
  Protocol with Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) labeled switched path 
  (LSP) with a fast-Reroute (FRR) backup or an end-to-end backup LSP. 
  PSN protection mechanisms cannot protect against failure of the a PE 
  node or the failure of the remote AC. Typically, this is supported 
  by dual-homing a Cutomer Edge (CE) node to different PE nodes which 
  provide a pseudowire emulated service across the PSN. A set of PW 
  mechanisms is theerfore required that enables a primary and one or 
  more backup backup PWs to terminate on different PE nodes. 
  In multi-segment PW (MS-PW) applications, PSN protection mechanisms 
  cannot protect against the failure of a switching PE (S-PE). A set 
  of mechanisms that support the operation of a primary and one or 
  more backup PWs via a diferent set of S-PEs is therefore required. 
  The paths of these PWs are diverse in the sense that they are 
  switched at different S-PE nodes.  
  In both of these applications, PW redundancy is important to 
  maximise the resiliency of the emulated service.  
  This document describes framework for these applications and its 
  associated operational requirements. The framework utilizes a new PW 
  status, called the Preferential Forwarding Status of the PW. This is 
  separate from the operational states defined in RFC4447 [2]. The 
  mechanisms for PW redundancy are modeled on general protection 
  switching principles. 
   
2. Terminology  
  o UP PW:  A PW which has been configured (label mapping exchanged 
     between PEs) and s not in any of the PW defect states specified 
     in [2]. Such a PW is available for forwarding traffic.

Internet-Draft        Pseudowire Redundancy      September 22, 2011 
   
  o DOWN PW: A PW that has either not been fully configured, or has 
     been configured and is in any one of the PW defect states 
     specified in [2]. Such a PW is not available for forwarding 
     traffic. 
  o Active PW.  An UP PW used for forwarding user, OAM and control 
     plane traffic.  
  o Standby PW. An UP PW that is not used for forwarding user traffic 
     but may forward OAM and specific control plane traffic.  
  o PW Endpoint: A PE where a PW terminates on a point where Native 
     Service Processing is performed, e.g., A Single Segment PW (SS-
     PW) PE, a Multi-Segment Pseudowire (MS-PW) Terminating PE (T-PE), 
     or a Hierarchical VPLS MTU-s or PE-rs. 
  o Primary PW: the PW which a PW endpoint activates (i.e. uses for 
     forwarding) in preference to any other PW when more than one PW 
     qualifies for active state. When the primary PW comes back up 
     after a failure and qualifies for the active state, the PW 
     endpoint always reverts to it. The designation of Primary is 
     performed by local configuration for the PW at the PE.  
  o Secondary PW: when it qualifies for the active state, a Secondary 
     PW is only selected if no Primary PW is configured or if the 
     configured primary PW does not qualify for active state (e.g., is 
     DOWN). By default, a PW in a redundancy PW set is considered 
     secondary. There is no Revertive mechanism among secondary PWs. 
  o Revertive protection switching. Traffic will be carried by 
     primary PW if it is UP and a wait-to-restore timer expires and 
     primary PW is made the Active PW. 
  o Non-revertive protection switching. Traffic will be carried by 
     the last PW  selected as a result of previous active PW entering 
     Operationally DOWN state.   
  o Manual selection of PW. The ability for the operator to manually 
     select the primary/secondary PWs.    
  This document uses the term 'PE' to be synonymous with both PEs as 
         per RFC3985 and T-PEs as per RFC5659.

3. Reference Models  
  Following sections describe show the reference architecture of the 
  PE for PW redundancy and its usage in different topologies and 
  applications. 
   
3.1. PE Architecture 
  Figure 1 shows the PE architecture for PW redundancy, when more than 
  one PW in a redundant set is associated with a single AC. This is 
  based on the architecture in Figure 4b of RFC3985 [3]. The forwarder 
  selects which of the redundant PWs to use based on the criteria 
  described in this document.

3.2. PW Redundancy Network Reference Scenarios 
  This section presents a set of reference scenarios for PW 
  redundancy.  
3.2.1. Single Multi-Homed CE 
  The following figure illustrates an application of single segment 
  pseudowire redundancy. This scenario is designed to protect the 
  emulated service against a failure of one of the PEs or ACs attached 
  to the multi-homed CE. Protection against failures of the PSN 
  tunnels is provided using PSN mechanisms such as MPLS Fast Reroute, 
  so that these failures do not impact the PW.

  CE1 is dual-homed to PE1 and PE3. A dual homing control protocol, 
  the details of which are outside the scope of this document, selects 
  which AC CE1 should use to forward towards the PSN, and which PE 
  (PE1 or PE3) should forward towards CE1.

          Figure 2 PW Redundancy with one Multi-Homed CE 
  In this scenario, only one of the PWs should be used for forwarding 
  between PE1 / PE3, and PE2. PW redundancy determines which PW to 
  make active based on the forwarding state of the ACs so that only 
  one path is available from CE1 to CE2. 
  Consider the example where the AC from CE1 to PE1 is initially 
  active and the AC from CE1 to PE3 is initially standby. PW1 is made 
  active and PW2 is made standby in order to complete the path to CE2. 
  On failure of the AC between CE1 and PE1, the forwarding state of 
  the AC on PE3 transitions to Active. The preferential forwarding 
  state of PW2 therefore needs to become active, and PW1 standby, in 
  order to reestablish connectivity between CE1 and CE2. PE3 therefore 
  uses PW2 to forward towards CE2, and PE2 uses PW2 instead of PW1 to 
  forward towards CE1. PW redundancy in this scenario requires that 
  the forwarding status of the ACs at PE1 and PE3 be signaled to PE2 
  so that PE2 can choose which PW to make active. 
  Changes occurring on the dual homed side of network due to a failure 
  of the AC or PE are not propagated to the ACs on the other side of

  the network. Furthermore, failures in the PSN are not be propagated 
  to the attached CEs.  
    
3.2.2. Multiple Multi-homed CEs 
  This scenario, illustrated in Figure 3, is also designed to protect 
  the emulated service against failures of the ACs and failures of the 
  PEs. Here, both CEs, CE1 and CE2, are dual-homed to their respective 
  PEs, PE1 and PE2, and PE3 and PE4. The method used by the CEs to 
  choose which AC to use to forward traffic towards the PSN is 
  determined by a dual-homing control protocol. The details of this 
  protocol are outside the scope of this document.   
  Note that the PSN tunnels are not shown in this figure for clarity. 
  However, it can be assumed that each of the PWs shown is 
  encapsulated in a separate PSN tunnel. Protection against failures 
  of the PSN tunnels is provided using PSN mechanisms such as MPLS 
  Fast Reroute, so that these failures do not impact the PW.

  MUST be selected to forward traffic. This document defines an 
  additional PW that reflects this forwarding state, which is separate 
  from the operational status of the PW. This is the 'Preferential 
  Forwarding Status'.  
  If a PW has a preferential forwarding status of 'active', it can be 
  used for forwarding traffic. The actual UP PW chosen by the combined 
  set of PEs that interconnect the CEs is determined by considering 
  the preferential forwarding status of each PW at each PE. The 
  mechanisms for achieving this selection are outside the scope of 
  this document. Only one PW is used for forwarding.   
  The following failure scenario illustrates the operation of PW 
  redundancy in Figure 2. In the initial steady state, when there are 
  no failures of the ACs, one of the PWs is chosen as the active PW, 
  and all others are chosen as standby. The dual-homing protocol 
  between CE1 and PE1/PE2 chooses to use the AC to PE2, while the 
  protocol between CE2 and PE3/PE4 chooses to use the AC to PE4. 
  Therefore the PW between PE2 and PE4 is chosen as the active PW to 
  complete the path between CE1 and CE2. 
  On failure of the AC between the dual-homed CE1 and PE2, the 
  preferential forwarding status of the PWs at PE1, PE2, PE3 and PE4 
  needs to change so as to re-establish a path from CE1 to CE2.  
  Different mechanisms can beused to achieve this and these are beyond 
  the scope of this document. After the change in status the algorithm 
  for selection of PW needs to revaluate and select PW to forward 
  traffic. In this application each dual-homing algorithm, i.e., {CE1, 
  PE1, PE2} and {CE2, PE3, PE4}, selects the active AC independently. 
  There is therefore a need to signal the active status of each AC 
  such that the PEs can select a common active PW for forwarding 
  between CE1 and CE2. 
  Changes occurring on one side of network due to a failure of the AC 
  or PE are not propagated to the ACs on the other side of the 
  network. Furthermore, failures in the PSN are not be propagated to 
  the attached CEs.  
  Note that End-to-end native service protection switching can also be 
  used to protect the emulated service in this scenario. In this case, 
  PW3 and PW4 are not necessary.  
   
  If the CEs do not perform native service protection switching, they 
  may instead may use load balancing across the paths between the CEs.

  Figure 4 Single homed CE with multi-segment pseudowire redundancy 
  CE1 is connected to PE1 and CE2 to PE2, respectively. There are 
  three multi-segment PWs. PW1 is switched at S-PE1, PW2 is switched 
  at S-PE2, and PW3 is switched at S-PE3. 
  Since there is no multi-homing running on the ACs, the T-PE nodes 
  would advertise 'Active' for the forwarding status based on a 
  priority for the PW. Priorities associate meaning of 'primary PW' 
  and 'secondary PW'. These priorities MUST be used in revertive mode 
  as well and paths must be switched accordingly. The priority can be 
  configuration or derivation from the PWid. Lower the PWid higher the 
  priority. However, this does not guarantee selection of same PW by 
  the T-PEs because, for example, mismatch of the configuration of the 
  PW priority in each T-PE. The intent of this application is to have 
  T-PE1 and T-PE2 synchronize the transmit and receive paths of the PW 
  over the network. In other words, both T-PE nodes are required to 
  transmit over the PW segment which is switched by the same S-PE. 
  This is desirable for ease of operation and troubleshooting.

3.4. PW redundancy between MTU-s in H-VPLS  
  Following figure illustrates the application of use of PW redundancy 
  to Hierarchical VPLS (H-VPLS). Here, and MTU-s is dual-homed to two 
  PE-rs.

            Figure 5  Multi-homed MTU-s in H-VPLS core                   
  In Figure 5, the MTU-s is dual homed to PE1 and PE2 and has spoke 
  PWs to each of them. The MTU-s needs to choose only one of the spoke 
  PWs ( the active PW) to one of the PE to forward the traffic and the 
  other to standby status. The MTU-s can derive the status of the PWs 
  based on local policy configuration. PE1 and PE2 are connected to 
  the H-VPLS core on the other side of network. The MTU-s communicates 
  the status of its member PWs for a set of VSIs having common status 
  of Active or Standby. Here the MTU-s controls the selection of PWs 
  to forward the traffic. Signaling using PW grouping with a common 
  group-id in PWid FEC Element or Grouping TLV in Generalized PWid FEC 
  Element as defined in [2] to PE1 and PE2 respectively, is 
  recommended to scale better.   
  Whenever MTU-s performs a switchover, it needs to communicate to PE2 
  for the Standby PW group the changed status of active. 
  In this scenario, PE devices are aware of switchovers at MTU-s and 
  could generate MAC Withdraw Messages to trigger MAC flushing within 
  the H-VPLS full mesh. By default, MTU-s devices should still trigger 
  MAC Withdraw messages as currently defined in [5] to prevent two 
  copies of MAC withdraws to be sent (one by MTU-s and another one by 
  PEs). Mechanisms to disable MAC Withdraw trigger in certain devices 
  is out of the scope of this document.

3.5. PW redundancy between VPLS n-PEs  
  Following figure illustrates the application of use of PW redundancy 
  for dual homed connectivity between PE devices in a ring topology.

              Figure 6   Redundancy in Ring topology                
  In Figure 6, PE1 and PE3 from VPLS domain A are connected to PE2 and 
  PE4 in VPLS domain B via PW group 1 and group 2. Each of the PEs in 
  the respective domains is connected to each other as well as forming 
  the ring topology. Such scenarios may arise in inter-domain H-VPLS 
  deployments where rapid spanning tree (RSTP) or other mechanisms may 
  be used to maintain loop free connectivity of PW groups. 
  [5] outlines multi-domain VPLS services without specifying how 
  multiple redundant border PEs per domain per VPLS instance can be 
  supported. In the example above, PW group 1 may be blocked at PE1 by 
  RSTP and it is desirable to block the group at PE2 by virtue of 
  exchanging the PW preferential forwarding status of Standby. How the 
  PW grouping should be done here is again deployment specific and is 
  out of scope of the solution.

                    Figure 7   Bridge Module Model 
  In Figure 7, two provider access networks, each having two n-PEs, 
  where the n-PEs are connected via a full mesh of PWs for a given 
  VPLS instance. As shown in the figure, only one n-PE in each access 
  network is serving as a Primary PE (P) for that VPLS instance and 
  the other n-PE is serving as the backup PE (B). In this figure, each 
  primary PE has two active PWs originating from it. Therefore, when a 
  multicast, broadcast, and unknown unicast frame arrives at the 
  primary n-PE from the access network side, the n-PE replicates the 
  frame over both PWs in the core even though it only needs to send 
  the frames over a single PW (shown with == in the figure) to the 
  primary n-PE on the other side. This is an unnecessary replication 
  of the customer frames that consumes core-network bandwidth (half of 
  the frames get discarded at the receiving n-PE). This issue gets 
  aggravated when there is three or more n-PEs per provider, access 
  network. For example if there are three n-PEs or four n-PEs per 
  access network, then 67% or 75% of core-BW for multicast, broadcast 
  and unknown unicast are respectively wasted.

  In this scenario, n-PEs can disseminate the status of PWs 
  active/standby among them and furthermore to have it tied up with 
  the redundancy mechanism such that per VPLS instance the status of 
  active/backup n-PE gets reflected on the corresponding PWs emanating 
  from that n-PE. 
4. Generic PW redundancy requirements 
4.1. Protection switching requirements 
  o Protection architecture such as N:1,1:1 or 1+1 can be used. N:1 
     protection case is somewhat inefficient in terms of capacity 
     consumption hence implementations SHOULD support this method 
     while  1:1 being subset and efficient MUST be supported. 1+1 
     protection architecture can be supported but is left for further 
     study. 
  o Non-revertive mode MUST be supported, while revertive mode is an 
     optional one.  
  o Protection switchover can be operator driven like Manual 
     lockout/force switchover or due to signal failure. Both methods 
     MUST be supported and signal failure MUST be given higher 
     priority than any local or far end request. 
4.2.  Operational requirements 
  o (T-)PEs involved in protecting a PW SHOULD automatically discover 
     and attempt to resolve inconsistencies in the configuration of 
     primary/secondary PW.  
  o (T-)PEs involved in protecting a PW SHOULD automatically discover 
     and attempt to resolve inconsistencies in the configuration of 
     revertive/non-revertive protection switching mode.   
  o (T-)PEs that do not automatically discover or resolve 
     inconsistencies in the configuration of primary/secondary, 
     revertive/non-revertive, or other parameters MUST generate an 
     alarm upon detection of an inconsistent configuration.  
  o (T-)PEs involved with protection switching MUST support the 
     configuration of revertive or non-revertive protection switching 
     mode. 
  o (T-)PEs involved with protection switching SHOULD support the 
     local invocation of protection switching.

  o (T-)PEs involved with protection switching SHOULD support the 
     local invocation of a lockout of protection switching.   
  o In standby status PW can still receive packets in order to avoid 
     black holing of in-flight packets during switchover. However in 
     case of use of VPLS application packets are dropped in standby 
     status except for the OAM packets.   
   
5. Security Considerations  
  This document expects extensions to LDP that are needed for 
  protecting pseudo-wires. It will have the same security properties 
  as in LDP [4] and the PW control protocol [2]. 
6. IANA considerations 
  This document has no actions for IANA.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a model for managing encapsulated SONET/SDH
   Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) digital signals for transmission over
   a Packet Switched Network (PSN).

   This document is closely related to [RFC4842], which describes the
   technology to encapsulate TDM signals and provide the Circuit
   Emulation Service over a Packet Switched Network (PSN).

   The model for Circuit Emulation Service Over Packet (CEP) 
   management is a MIB module.  The PW-CEP-STD-MIB
   module described in this document works closely with the MIB modules
   described in [RFC5601] and the textual conventions defined in 
   [RFC5542]. In the spirit of the [RFC2863], a CEP connection will be 
   a pseudowire(PW), and will therefore not be represented in the 
   ifTable.

   CEP is currently specified to carry "structured" SONET/SDH paths,
   meaning that each SONET/SDH PATH/VT within the section/line/path can
   be processed separately.  The SONET/SDH section/line/path interface
   stack is modeled within [RFC3592].

   This document adopts the definitions, acronyms and mechanisms
   described in [RFC3985].  Unless otherwise stated, the mechanisms of
   [RFC3985] apply and will not be re-described here.

   Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   CEP terminology comes from [RFC4842] that describes a mechanism for
   transporting SONET/SDH Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) digital
   signals over a packet-oriented network.  The mechanism for structured
   emulation (as outlined in [RFC4842]) terminates the SONET/SDH
   section and line overhead and then breaks the SONET/SDH path's
   Synchronous Payload Envelope (SPE) into fragments for transmission
   over a PSN.  Mechanism for terminating of the SONET/SDH path overhead
   and extracting SONET VTs are also described in [RFC4842].  Mechanisms
   for Fractional SONET/SDH SPE emulation are described in [RFC4842].  A
   CEP header is appended at the beginning of each fragment to provide
   information regarding where the SPE begins within the packet stream,
   a sequence number and pointer adjustment information (see [RFC4842]).

   "Outbound" references the traffic direction where a SONET/SDH path's
   payload (SPE) is received, adapted to packet, assigned a PW label and
   sent into the PSN.

   Conversely, "inbound" is the direction where packets are received
   from the PSN, packet payloads are reassembled back into an SPE and
   inserted as a SONET/SDH path into the SONET/SDH section and line.

   Since a SONET/SDH path is bi-directional and symmetrical, CEP uses
   the same SONET/SDH time-slot, SONET/SDH width and packet size.
   Inbound and outbound PW labels may differ.

4.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


5.  Feature Checklist

   The PW-CEP-STD-MIB module is designed to satisfy the following
   requirements and constraints:

   -  The MIB module is designed to work with the PW-STD-MIB[RFC5601]
      module.



Zelig, et al.             Expires September 2011             [Page 4]

                     PWE3 CEP MIB                     March 8, 2011 




   -  The MIB module is independent of the PSN type.

   -  The MIB module supports all the signal types as defined in
      [RFC4842]: SPE, fractional SPE, VT, both SONET and SDH mapping and
      all the optional features as defined in [RFC4842].

   -  The MIB module reports all the statistics as defined by [RFC4842].


6.  MIB Module Description and Usage

   For clarity of the description below, in most cases we refer to the
   SONET PATH signal configuration only, but the same examples are
   applicable for SDH signals and VT level processing as well, as
   described in [RFC3985].

6.1.  PW-CEP-STD-MIB Summary

   -  The CEP PW Table (pwCepTable) contains the SONET/SDH Path/VT
      ifIndex, SONET/SDH Path Time slot, the pwCepCfgTable index, config
      error indications and various status indications.

   -  The CEP PW Configuration Parameter Table (pwCepCfgTable) has
      objects for CEP PW configuration.  In situations where sets of
      config objects are common amongst more than one CEP PW, a single
      entry here may be referenced by many pwCepTable entries.

   -  The CEP Performance Current Table (pwCemPerfCurrentTable) contains
      CEP stats for the current 15-minute period.

   -  The CEP Performance 15 Minute Interval Table
      (pwCemPerfIntervalTable) is similar to the pwCemPerfCurrentTable.
      It contains historical intervals (usually 96 15-minute entries to
      cover a 24 hour period).

      Note: the performance interval statistics are supported by CEP due
      to the very function of CEP - that is, processing SONET/SDH.  See
      [RFC3592].

   -  The CEP Performance 1 day Table (pwCepPerf1DayTable) contains
      statistics accumulated during the current day and contains
      previous days historical statistics.

   -  The CEP Fractional Table (pwCepFracTable) adds configuration and
      monitoring parameters for fractional SPE PWs.

6.2.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The PW-CEP-STD-MIB IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578],
   SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB
   [RFC3411], PerfHist-TC-MIB [RFC3593], HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB [RFC3705],
   IF-MIB [RFC2863], PW-STD-MIB [RFC5601] and PW-TC-STD-MIB [RFC5542].

6.3.  PW-STD-MIB Modules Usage

   The MIB module structure for defining a PW service is composed of
   three layers of MIB modules functioning together.  This general model
   is defined in the PWE3 architecture [RFC3985].  The layering model is
   intended to sufficiently isolate PW services from the underlying PSN
   layer that carries the emulated service.  This is done at the same
   time as providing a standard means for connecting any supported
   services to any supported PSNs.

   The first layer, known as the service layer, contains service-
   specific modules such as the one defined in this document.  These
   modules define service-specific management objects that interface or
   collaborate with existing MIB modules for the native version of the
   service.  The service-specific module "glues" the standard modules to
   the PWE3 MIB modules.  The PW-CEP-STD-MIB module defined in this memo
   serves as one of the PW type-specific MIB module.

   The next layer of the PWE3 MIB framework is the PW-STD-MIB module
   [RFC5601].  This module is used to configure general parameters of 
   PWs that are common to all types of emulated services and PSNs.  This
   layer is connected to the service-specific layer above and the PSN
   layer below.

   The PSN layer provides PSN-specific modules for each type of PSN.
   These modules associate the PW with one or more "tunnels" that carry
   the service over the PSN.  These modules are defined in other
   documents.  This module is used to "glue" the PW service to the
   underlying PSN-specific MIB modules.

6.4.  PW-CEP-STD-MIB Module Usage

   Configuring a CEP PW involves the following steps.

   First create an entry in the pwTable:

   -  Follow steps as defined in [RFC5601].

   Configure the PSN tunnel in the respective PSN specific PWE3 PSN glue
   MIB module and the respective PSN specific MIB modules.  Configure
   the SONET Path parameters:

   -  Set the SONET path width in the sonetPathCurrentTable [RFC3592].




Zelig, et al.             Expires September 2011             [Page 6]

                     PWE3 CEP MIB                     March 8, 2011 



   -  Set the SONET path index and the SONET path starting time slot in
      the pwCepTable.

   NOTE: The agent had created an entry in the pwCepTable based on the
   entry created in the pwTable.

   Configure the CEP PW:

   -  If necessary, create an entry in the pwCepCfgTable (a suitable
      entry may already exist).  Set packet length, etc.

   -  Set the index of this pwCepCfgTable entry in the pwCepTable.

   Observe the CEP PW:

   -  Once a CEP PW is operational, the pwCepPerfCurrentTable,
      pwCepPerfIntervalTable and pwCepPerf1DayTable can be used to
      monitor the various counts, indicators and conditions of the PW.


6.5.  Example of PW-CEP-STD-MIB Usage

   In this section we provide an example of using the MIB objects
   described in Section 7 to set up a CEP PW.  While this example is not
   meant to illustrate every permutation of the MIB, it is intended as
   an aid to understanding some of the key concepts.  It is meant to be
   read after going through the MIB itself.  See [RFC5601] for an 
   example of setting up PSN Tunnels.

   First configure the SONET path width, starting time-slot and
   associated CEP PW.  In this case, an STS-3c starts at SONET time slot
   1 (and is distributed normally within the SONET frame).  In the
   following example, the ifIndex for the sonetPathCurrentEntry is 23,
   while the pwCepCfgTable index is 9.

   In [RFC3592] sonetPathCurrentEntry (ifIndex = 23) :

   {
      sonetPathCurrentWidth           = 3,
      sonetPathCurrentStatus
      ...
      ...
   }

   Create an entry in the pwCepCfgTable (index = 9) :

   {
      pwCepCfgSonetPaylaodLength    = 783 -- payload bytes
      pwCepCfgMinPktLength          = 0   -- no minimum

                     PWE3 CEP MIB                     March 8, 2011 



      pwCepCfgPktReorder            = true
      pwCepCfgEnableDBA             = unequipped
      pwCepCfgRtpHdrSuppress        = false
      pwCepCfgJtrBfrDepth           = 500 -- micro-seconds

      pwCepCfgConsecPktsInsync      = 2   -- Exit  LOPS state
      pwCepCfgConsecMissingOutSync  = 10  -- Enter LOPS state

      pwCepCfgPktErrorPlayOutValue  = 0xFF -- All ones

      pwCepCfgMissingPktsToSes      =  3  -- packets,
      pwCepCfgSesToUas              =  2  -- seconds,
      pwCepCfgSecsToExitUas         = 10  -- seconds,

      pwCepCfgRowStatus             = createAndGo
   }

   In the PW-STD-MIB module: Get a new index and create a new pwTable
   entry using pwIndexNext (here, the PW index = 83) and pwRowStatus.
   In this new entry, set pwType to 'cep'.  The agent will create a new
   entry in the pwCepTable.  Set the SONET path ifIndex, SONET path time
   slot and Cfg Table indexes within this new pwCep table entry:
   {
      pwCepSonetIfIndex     = 23 -- Index of associated entry
                                   -- in sonetPathCurrent table.

      pwCepCfgIndex         = 9  -- Index of associated entry
                                   -- in pwCepCfg table (above).

8.  Security Considerations

   It is clear that this MIB module is potentially useful for monitoring
   CEP PWs.  This MIB can also be used for configuration of certain
   objects and anything that can be configured can be incorrectly
   configured, with potentially disastrous results.

   There are number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  the pwCepTable, pwCepCfgTable and pwCepFracTable contains objects
      to CEP PW parameters on a Provider Edge (PE) device.  Unauthorized
      access to objects in these tables could result in disruption of
      traffic on the network.  The use of stronger mechanisms such as
      SNMPv3 security should be considered where possible.
      Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be used with any v3 agent
      which implements this MIB module.  Administrators should consider
      whether read access to these objects should be allowed, since read
      access may be undesirable under certain circumstances.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible), may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their



Zelig, et al.             Expires September 2011            [Page 62]

                     PWE3 CEP MIB                     March 8, 2011 



   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  the pwCepTable, pwCepPerfCurrentTable, pwCepPerfIntervalTable and
      pwCepPerf1DayTable collectively show the CEP pseudowire
      connectivity topology and its performance characteristics.  If an
      Administrator does not want to reveal this information, then these
      tables should be considered sensitive/vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.


9.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ----------        -----------------------

         pwCepStdMIB        { mib-2 XXXX }

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): The IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXXX"

   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

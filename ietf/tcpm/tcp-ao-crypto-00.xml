    <abstract>
      <t>The TCP Authentication Option, TCP-AO, relies on security algorithms
      to provide authentication between two end-points. There are many such
      algorithms available, and two TCP-AO systems cannot interoperate unless
      they are using the same algorithm(s). This document specifies the
      algorithms and attributes that can be used in TCP-AO's current manual
      keying mechanism.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document is a companion to TCP-AO <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-tcp-auth-opt">[TCP-AO]</xref>. Like most security
      protocols, TCP-AO allows users to chose which cryptographic algorithm(s)
      they want to use to meet their security needs.</t>

      <t>TCP-AO provides cryptographic authentication and message integrity
      verification between to end-points. In order to accomplish this
      function, one employs message authentication codes (MACs). There are
      various ways to create MACs. The use of hashed-based MACs (HMAC) in
      Internet protocols is defined in <xref target="RFC2104"></xref>. The use
      of cipher-based MACs (CMAC) in Internet protocols is defined in <xref
      target="RFC4493"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This RFC discusses the requirements for implementations to support
      two MACs used in TCP-AO, both now and in the future, and includes the
      rationale behind the present and future requirements. The document then
      specifies the use of those two MACs with TCP-AO.</t>

        <t>NOTE EXPLAINING WHY TWO MAC ALGORITHMS WERE MANDATED:</t>

        <t>The security issues driving the migration from SHA-1 to SHA-256 for
        digital signatures <xref target="HMAC-ATTACK">[HMAC-ATTACK] </xref>do
        not immediately render SHA-1 weak for this application of SHA-1 in
        HMAC mode. The security strength of SHA-1 HMACs should be sufficient
        for the foreseeable future, especially given that the tags are
        truncated to 96 bits. However, while it's clear that the attacks
        aren't practical on SHA-1, these types of analysis are mounting and
        could potentially pose a concern for HMAC forgery if they were
        significantly improved, over time. In anticipation of SHA-1's growing
        less dependable over time, but given its wide deployment and current
        strength, it is a "MUST" for TCP-AO today. AES-128 CMAC is considered
        to be far stronger algorithm, but may not yet have very wide
        implementation. It is also a "MUST" to implement, in order to drive
        vendors toward its use.</t>

               title="Requirements for Future MAC Algorithms">
        <t>Since this document provides cryptographic agility, it is also
        important to establish requirements for future MAC algorithms. The
        TCPM WG should restrict any future MAC algorithms for this
        specification to ones that can protect at least 2**48 messages with a
        probability that a collision will occur of less than one in a
        billion.</t>

      <t>TCP-AO refers to this document saying that the MAC mechanism employed
      for a connection is listed in the TAPD entry, and is chosen from a list
      of MACs both named and described in this document.</t>

      <t>TCP-AO requires two classes of cryptographic algorithms:</t>

            </list></t>
        </list></t>

      <t></t>

      <t>In TCP-AO, these algorithms are always used in pairs. Each MAC

        <t>TCP-AO's Traffic_Keys are derived using KDFs. The KDFs used in
        TCP-AO's current manual keying have the following interface:</t>

        <t><list hangIndent="4" style="empty">

        <t>NOTE: The cited NIST document on KDFs calls for an input: (i ||
        Label || 0x00 || Context || Output_Length). That document states that
        the "0x00" is an all zero octet and is "an optional data field used to
        indicate a separation of different variable length data fields". In
        our case, the "Label" is specified and fixed, thus its data field is
        fixed, not variable, so there is no need for the 0x00 separator. Thus,
        we have dropped it.</t>

        <t></t>

        <t>When invoked, a KDF runs a certain PRF, using the Master_Key as the
        seed, and Input as the message input and produces a result of
        Output_Length bits. This result may then be used as a cryptographic
        key for any algorithm which takes an Output_Length length key as its
        seed. A KDF MAY specify a maximum Output_Length parameter.</t>

        <t>Other KDFs may be defined in future revisions of this document, and

        <t><list hangIndent="5" style="numbers">
            <t>The underlying PRFs specified in this document have fixed sized

            in the case of HMAC-SHA1.</t>

            <t>It is possible to generate an arbitrary number of output bits
            with some given PRF by operating it in a feedback or counter mode.
            The KDFs described in <xref target="NIST-SP800-108"></xref>
            incorporate this feature, hence the counter "i", which creates

            <t>If one wanted to use these KDFs with a MAC requiring a longer

          <t>Whereas the KDF_SHA1 used only one round to produce the
          Traffic_Key, the KDF_AES will take two steps. The reasoning
          follows:</t>

          <t>The Master_Key in TCP-AO's current manual keying mechanism is a
          shared secret, entered by an administrator. It is passed via an
          out-of-band mechanism between two devices, and often between two
          organizations. The shared secret does not have to be 16 octets, and
          the length may vary. However, AES_128_CMAC requires a key of 16
          octets (128 bits) in length. We could mandate that implementations
          force administrators to input Master_Keys of exactly 128 bit length,
          and with sufficient randomness, but this places undue burdon on the
          deployers. This specification RECOMMENDS that deployers use a
          randomly generated 128-bit string as the Master_Key, but
          acknowledges that deployers may not.</t>

          <t>To handle variable length Master_Keys we use a similar mechanism
          to the AES-CMAC-PRF-128 mechanism represented in <xref
          target="RFC4615"></xref>, Sect 3. We do a two step process.</t>

          <t>First we use AES_128_CMAC with a fixed key as a "randomness
          extractor", while using the shared secret Master_Key, MK, as the
          message input to produce a 128 bit key K.</t>

          <t>Second, we run AES_128_CMAC again, this time using K as the key
          and the normal Input I (as described above) as the message input to
          produce Traffic_Key, TK.</t>

          <t>Therefore this KDF is always a 2 step function, as follows
          (borrowing the format from <xref target="RFC4615"></xref>):</t>

          <t>This section provides suggested representations for the KDFs in

          common implementations will make interoperability easier and simpler
          for deployers.</t>

          <t>UIs SHOULD refer to the choice of KDF_HMAC_SHA1 as simply

          <t>UIs SHOULD refer to the choice of KDF_AES_128_CMAC as simply

          <t>UIs SHOULD use KDF_HMAC_SHA1 as the default selection in TCP-AO
          settings. KDF_HMAC_SHA1 is preferred at this time solely because it
          has wide support, being present in most implementations in the
          marketplace. When such a time arrives as KDF_AES_128_CMAC becomes
          widely deployed, this document should be updated so that it becomes
          the default KDF on implementations.</t>

        <t>An important aspect to note about these algorithms' definitions for
        use in TCP-AO is the fact that the MAC outputs are truncated to 96

        a 160 bit result. The MAC output are then truncated to 96 bits to
        provide a reasonable tradeoff between security and message size, for

          significant bits first order. The MAC length must be specified
          before the communication starts, and it must not be changed during
          the lifetime of the key." Therefore, we explicitly specify the
          employed MAC length for TCP-AO to be 96 bits.</t>

      <t>This document inherits all of the security considerations of the
      TCP-AO, the AES-CMAC, and the HMAC-SHA-1 documents.</t>

      <t>The security of cryptographic-based systems depends on both the
      strength of the cryptographic algorithms chosen and the strength of the
      keys used with those algorithms. The security also depends on the
      engineering of the protocol used by the system to ensure that there are
      no non-cryptographic ways to bypass the security of the overall
      system.</t>

      <t>Care should also be taken to ensure that the selected key is
      unpredictable, avoiding any keys known to be weak for the algorithm in
      use. ]<xref target="RFC4086"></xref> contains helpful information on
      both key generation techniques and cryptographic randomness.</t>

      <t>Note that in the composition of KDF_AES_128_CMAC, the PRF needs a 128
      bit / 16 byte key as the seed. However, for convenience to the
      administrators/deployers, we did not want to force them to enter a 16
      byte Master_Key. So we specified the sub-key routine that could handle a
      variable length Master_Key, one that might be less than 16 bytes. This
      does NOT mean that administrators are safe to use weak keys.
      Administrators are encouraged to follow <xref target="RFC4086"></xref>
      as listed above. We simply attempted to "put a fence around stupidity",
      in as much as possible.</t>

      <t>This document concerns itself with the selection of cryptographic
      algorithms for the use of TCP-AO. The algorithms identified in this
      document as "MUST implement" or "SHOULD implement" are not known to be
      broken at the current time, and cryptographic research so far leads us
      to believe that they will likely remain secure into the foreseeable
      future. Some of the algorithms may be found in the future to have
      properties significantly weaker than those that were believed at the
      time this document was produced. Expect that new revisions of this
      document will be issued from time to time. Be sure to search for more
      recent versions of this document before implementing.</t>

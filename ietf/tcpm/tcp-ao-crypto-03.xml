    <abstract>
      <t>The TCP Authentication Option, TCP-AO, relies on security algorithms
      to provide authentication between two end-points. There are many such
      algorithms available, and two TCP-AO systems cannot interoperate unless
      they are using the same algorithms. This document specifies the
      algorithms and attributes that can be used in TCP-AO's current manual
      keying mechanism, and provides the interface for future MACs.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document is a companion to <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-tcp-auth-opt"></xref>. Like most modern
      security protocols, TCP-AO allows users to chose which cryptographic
      algorithm(s) they want to use to meet their security needs.</t>

      <t>TCP-AO provides cryptographic authentication and message integrity
      verification between two end-points. In order to accomplish this
      function, message authentication codes (MACs) are used, which then rely
      on shared keys. There are various ways to create MACs. The use of
      hashed-based MACs (HMAC) is defined in <xref target="RFC2104"></xref>.
      The use of cipher-based MACs (CMAC) is defined in <xref
      target="NIST-SP800-38B"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This RFC defines the general requirements for MACs used in TCP-AO,
      both for currently specified MACs and for any future specified MACs. It
      specifies two MAC algorithms required in all TCP-AO implementations. It
      also specifies two key derivation functions (KDFs) used to create the
      traffic keys used by the MACs. These KDFs are also required by all
      TCP-AO implementations.</t>

            <t>The Master_Key in TCP-AO's current manual keying mechanism is a
            shared secret, entered by an administrator. It is passed via an
            out-of-band mechanism between two devices, and often between two
            organizations. The shared secret does not have to be 16 octets,
            and the length may vary. However, AES_128_CMAC requires a key of
            exactly 16 octets (128 bits) in length. We could mandate that
            implementations force administrators to input Master_Keys of
            exactly 128 bit length when using AES_128_CMAC, and with
            sufficient randomness, but this places undue burden on the
            implementors and deployers. This specification RECOMMENDS that
            deployers use a randomly generated 128-bit string as the
            Master_Key, but acknowledges that deployers may not.</t>

            <t>To handle variable length Master_Keys we use the same mechanism
            as described in <xref target="RFC4615"></xref>, Sect 3. First we

            <t>In step 1, the 128-bit key, K, for AES-CMAC is derived as
            follows:</t>

            <t>o If the Master_Key, MK, provided by the administrator is
            exactly 128 bits, then we use it as-is.</t>

            <t>o If it is longer or shorter than 128 bits, then we derive the
            key K by applying the AES-CMAC algorithm using the 128-bit
            all-zero string as the key and MK as the input message. This step
            is described in step 1b.</t>

            <t>In step 2, we apply the AES-CMAC algorithm again, this time
            using K as the key and I as the input message.</t>

            <t>The output of this algorithm returns TK, the Traffic_Key, which
            is 128 bits suitable for use in the MAC function on each TCP
            segment of the connection.</t>

            <t>This section provides suggested representations for the KDFs in
            implementation user interfaces. Following these guidelines across
            common implementations will make interoperability easier and
            simpler for deployers.</t>

            <t>UIs SHOULD refer to the choice of KDF_HMAC_SHA1 as simply
            "SHA1".</t>

            <t>UIs SHOULD refer to the choice of KDF_AES_128_CMAC as simply

            <t>The initial IANA registry values will reflect these two
            entries.</t>

            <t>UIs SHOULD use KDF_HMAC_SHA1 as the default selection in TCP-AO
            settings. KDF_HMAC_SHA1 is preferred at this time because it has
            wide support, being present in most implementations in the

        <t>This document specifies two MAC algorithm options for generating
        the MAC as used by TCP-AO:</t>

            <t></t>
          </list>Both provide a high level of security and efficiency. The
        AES-128-CMAC-96 is potentially more efficient, particularly in
        hardware, but HMAC-SHA-1-96 is more widely used in Internet protocols
        and in most cases could be supported with little or no additional code
        in today's deployed software and devices.</t>

        <t>An important aspect to note about these algorithms' definitions for
        use in TCP-AO is the fact that the MAC outputs are truncated to 96
        bits. AES-128-CMAC-96 produces a 128 bit MAC, and HMAC SHA-1 produces
        a 160 bit result. The MAC output are then truncated to 96 bits to
        provide a reasonable tradeoff between security and message size, for
        fitting into the TCP-AO option field.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document inherits all of the security considerations of the
      TCP-AO, the AES-CMAC, and the HMAC-SHA-1 documents.</t>

      <t>The security of cryptography-based systems depends on both the
      strength of the cryptographic algorithms chosen and the strength of the
      keys used with those algorithms. The security also depends on the
      engineering of the protocol used by the system to ensure that there are
      no non-cryptographic ways to bypass the security of the overall
      system.</t>

      <t>Care should also be taken to ensure that the selected key is
      unpredictable, avoiding any keys known to be weak for the algorithm in
      use. <xref target="RFC4086"></xref> contains helpful information on both
      key generation techniques and cryptographic randomness.</t>

      <t>Note that in the composition of KDF_AES_128_CMAC, the PRF needs a 128
      bit / 16 byte key as the seed. However, for convenience to the
      administrators/deployers, we did not want to force them to enter a 16
      byte Master_Key. So we specified the sub-key routine that could handle a
      variable length Master_Key, one that might be less than 16 bytes. This
      does NOT mean that administrators are safe to use weak keys.
      Administrators are encouraged to follow <xref target="RFC4086"></xref>
      as listed above. We simply attempted to "put a fence around
      foolishness", in as much as possible.</t>

      <t>This document concerns itself with the selection of cryptographic
      algorithms for the use of TCP-AO. The algorithms identified in this
      document as "MUST implement" are not known to be broken at the current
      time, and cryptographic research so far leads us to believe that they
      will likely remain secure into the foreseeable future. Some of the
      algorithms may be found in the future to have properties significantly
      weaker than those that were believed at the time this document was
      produced. Expect that new revisions of this document will be issued from
      time to time. Be sure to search for more recent versions of this
      document before implementing.</t>

      <t>NOTE EXPLAINING WHY TWO MAC ALGORITHMS WERE MANDATED:</t>

      <t>Two MAC algorithms and two corresponding KDFs are mandated as a
      result of discussion in the TCPM WG, and in consultation with the
      Security Area Directors. SHA-1 was selected because it is widely
      deployed and currently has sufficient strength and reasonable
      computational cost, so it is a "MUST" for TCP-AO today. The security
      strength of SHA-1 HMACs should be sufficient for the foreseeable future,
      especially given that the tags are truncated to 96 bits.</t>

      <t>Recently exposed vulnerabilities in other MACs (e.g., MD5 or HMAC
      MD5) aren't practical on SHA-1, but these types of analyses are mounting
      and could potentially pose a concern for HMAC forgery if they were
      significantly improved, over time. The security issues driving the
      migration from SHA-1 to SHA-256 for digital signatures <xref
      target="HMAC-ATTACK"></xref> do not immediately render SHA-1 weak for
      this application of SHA-1 in HMAC mode.</t>

      <t>AES-128 CMAC is considered to be a stronger algorithm than SHA-1, but
      may not yet have very wide implementation. AES-128 CMAC is also a "MUST"
      to implement, in order to drive vendors toward its use, and to allow for
      another MAC option, if SHA-1 were to be compromised.</t>

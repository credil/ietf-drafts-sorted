      <t>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) was not
      written with the expectation that additional stateful DHCPv6
      options would be developed. IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host
      Configuration Protocol (DHCP) version 6 shoe-horned the new
      options for Prefix Delegation into DHCPv6. Implementation
      experience of the CPE model described in has shown multiple
      issues with the DHCPv6 protocol in supporting multiple stateful
      options.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC3315"/> was not written with the
      expectation that additional stateful DHCPv6 options would be
      developed. DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation <xref target="RFC3633"/>
      shoe-horned the new options for Prefix Delegation into
      DHCPv6. Implementation experience of the CPE model described in
      <xref target="RFC6204"/> has shown multiple issues with the
      DHCPv6 protocol in supporting multiple stateful options.</t>

      <t>This document describes a number of problems encountered with
      multiple IA option types into DHCP and recommended changes to
      the DHCPv6 protocol specifications.</t>

      <t>The intention of this work is to modify the DHCP protocol
      specification to support multiple IA option types within a
      single DHCP session. This problem can also be solved by
      implementing a separate DHCP session (separate client state
      machine) per IA option type. This latter approach has a number
      of issues: additional DHCP protocol traffic, 'collisions'
      between stateless options also included with the IA options,
      divergence in that each IA option type specification specifies
      its 'own' version of the DHCP protocol.</t>

      <t>The changes described in this document will be incorporated
      in a new revision of the DHCPv6 protocol specification <xref
      target="RFC3315"/>.</t>

    <!--  SECTION 4: Handling of multiple IA options types                         -->

    <section title="Handling of multiple IA options types">
      <t>DHCPv6 was written with the assumption that the only stateful
      options were for assigning addresses. DHCPv6 PD describes how
      to extend the DHCPv6 protocol to handle prefix delegation, but
      <xref target="RFC3633"/> did not consider how DHCP address
      assignment and prefix delegation could co-exist.</t>

      <t>If a client requests multiple IA option types, but the server
      is configured to only offer a subset of them, the client could
      react in several ways. Reset the state machine and continue to
      send Solicit messages, create separate DHCP sessions for each
      IA option type and continue to Solicit for the missing options,
      or it could continue with the single session, and include the
      missing options on subsequent messages to the server.</t>

      <t>Proposed solution: the client should keep a single session
      with the server and include the missing options on subsequent
      messages (Request, Renew, and Rebind) to the server.</t>

      <section title="Advertisement message">
	<t><xref target="RFC3315"/> specifies that a client must ignore an Advertise
	message if a server will not assign any addresses to a
	client. A client requesting both IA_NA and IA_PD, with a
	server that only offers one of them, is not supported in the
	current protocol specification.</t>

	<t>Proposed solution: a client SHOULD accept Advertise messages,
	even when not all IA option types are being offered. A client
	SHOULD ignore an Advertise message when no bindings at all
	are being offered. The client SHOULD include the not offered
	IA option types in its Request.</t>

	<t>Replace Section 17.1.3 of <xref target="RFC3315"/>: (existing errata)</t>
	<figure><artwork>
   The client MUST ignore any Advertise message that includes a Status
   Code option containing the value NoAddrsAvail, with the exception
   that the client MAY display the associated status message(s) to the
   user.

   The client MUST ignore any Advertise message that contains no
   bindings (if only IA_NA and/or IA_TA options were requested,
   this is a message that includes a Status Code option containing the
   value NoAddrsAvail), with the exception that the client MAY display
   the associated status message(s) to the user.
	</artwork></figure>

	<t>And, replace:</t>
	<figure><artwork>

   -  The client MAY choose a less-preferred server if that server
      has a better set of advertised parameters, such as the
      available options advertised in IAs.
	</artwork></figure>

        <t>It is important to note that the receipt of a Advertisement
	without any bindings does not imply that the client should
	restart the Solicit retransmissions timers. Doing so would
	lead to a Solicit/Advertisement storm.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Placement of Status codes">
	<t>In Reply messages IA specific status codes (NoAddrsAvail,
	NotOnlink, NoBinding) are encapsulated in the IA option. In
	Advertisement messages the Status Code option with the
	NoAddrsAvail code is in the "global" scope. That makes sense
	when the failure case is fatal. With the introduction of
	multiple IA option types, there might be a case where a server is
	not willing to offer addresses, but might be willing to offer
	other stateful option types.</t>

	<t>While a Status Code option is implicitly bound to a
	specific type of IA, e.g. NoPrefixAvail is only applicable to
	IA_PD and NoAddrsAvail is only applicable to IA_NA/IA_TA, it
	may be problematic to make this assumption for all status
	codes. Ideally the Status Code option should be encapsulated in
        the IA option for all DHCP messages. This makes Advertisement
	messages equal to Reply messages.</t>

	<t>Proposed solution: No change. For backwards compatibility,
        the NoAddrsAvail Status Code option when no addresses are
        available will be kept in the global scope for Advertise
        messages. Other IA option types MUST encapsulate the Status
        Code option within the IA option.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="T1/T2 timers">
	<t>The T1 and T2 timers determine when the client will contact
	the server to extend lifetimes of information received in an
	IA. How should a client handle the case where multiple IA
	options have different T1 and T2 timers?</t>

	<t>In a multiple IA option types model, the T1/T2 timers are
	protocol timers, that should be independent of the IA options
	themselves. If we were to redo the DHCP protocol from scratch
	the T1/T2 timers should be carried in a separate DHCP
	option.</t>

	<t>Proposed solution: The server SHOULD set the T1/T2 timers
	in all IA options in Reply and Advertise messages to the same
        value. To deal with the case where servers have not yet been
        updated to do that, clients MUST use the shortest (explicit or
        implicit) T1/T2 timer (larger than 0) in any IA options in the
        Reply. Longer T1/T2 timers are ignored.</t>

      </section>


      <section title="Renew and Rebind messages">
        <t>The Renew message, as described in <xref target="RFC3315"/>,
        allows a client to only renew bindings assigned via a Request
        message. The Rebind message, as described in <xref target="RFC3315"/>
        does not explicitly specify what a server should do when an IA
        option which contains no addresses is present.</t>

	<t>In a multiple IA option type model, the Renew does not support
	the ability for the client to renew one IA option type while
	requesting bindings for other IA option types that were not
	available when the client sent the Request.</t>

	<t>Proposed solution: The client should continue with the IA
	options received, while continuing to include the other IA
	options in subsequent messages to the server. The client
	and server processing need to be modified. Note that this
	change makes the server's IA processing of Renew and Rebind
	similar to the Request processing.</t>

   Solicit/Advertise/Request/Reply sequence periodically to obtain
   bindings for these IAs. However, it MUST limit the frequency at

      <section title="Confirm message">
	<t>The Confirm message, as described in <xref target="RFC3315"/>,
        is specific to address assignment. It lets a server without a
        binding to reply to the message, under the assumption that the
        server only needs knowledge about the prefix(es) on the link,
        to inform the client that the address is likely valid or not.
        This message is sent when e.g. the client has moved and needs
        to validate its addresses. Not all bindings can be validated by
        servers and the Confirm message provides for this by specifying
        that a server that is unable to determine the on-link status
        MUST NOT send a Reply.</t>

	<t>Note: Confirm has a specific meaning and does not overload
	Renew/Rebind. It also is lower processing cost as the server
	does NOT need to extend lease times or otherwise send back
	other configuration options.</t>

	<t>Proposed solution: Allow and specify the Confirm message
	for other IA option types. The server performs the same test
	as for addresses on the delegated prefixes (see
	<xref target="RFC3315"/>, section 18.2.2).</t>

      <section title="Multiple provisioning domains">
          <t>This document has assumed that all DHCP servers on a
          network are in a single provisioning domain and thus should be
          "equal" in the service that they offer. This was also assumed
          by <xref target="RFC3315"/> and <xref target="RFC3633"/>.</t>
          
          <t>One could envision a network where the DHCP servers are in multiple
          provisioning domains, and it may be desirable to have the DHCP client
          obtain different IA types from different provisioning domains. How a
          client detects the multiple provisioning domains and how it would
          interact with the multiple servers in these different domains is outside
          the scope of this document and an area for future work.</t>

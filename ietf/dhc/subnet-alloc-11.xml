      <t>This document defines a new DHCP option which is passed between the
      DHCP Client and the DHCP Server to request dynamic allocation of a
      subnet, give specifications of subnet(s) allocated, and report usage
      statistics. This memo documents the current usage of the option in
      agreement with <xref target="RFC3942"></xref>, which declares that any
      pre-existing usages of option numbers in the range 128 - 223 should be
      documented and the working group will try to officially assign those
      numbers to those options.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>There is a need for a DHCP Client to be able to allocate a subnet
      from a DHCP Server. Alternate methods of allocation, such as AAA are not
      appropriate for various reasons and the most straight-forward way to
      accomplish this allocation is via DHCP. A DHCP option to support this
      may be utilized by a simple Dialin Aggregation box, or even to implement
      a Hierarchical chain of DHCP Servers, each one in turn leasing one or
      more subnets to the next DHCP Server down the chain.</t>

      <t>This new DHCP option <xref target="RFC2132"></xref>, the Subnet
      Allocation option is specified in such a way as to use one DHCP Option
      number, while using suboption numbers for each function. The
      Subnet-Request suboption tells what types of subnets are needed and how
      many. The Subnet-Information suboption gives the actual subnet number(s)
      and allows for extra flags to convey additional information about each
      subnet. The "Subnet-Name" suboption allows a method of passing
      additional information about the requested subnet(s), such as department
      name, user name, customer number, etc. The "Suggested-Lease-Time"
      suboption provides a method for the DHCP Server to suggest a lease time
      for addresses allocated from the offered subnet. The DHCP Server has the
      option of not supplying all subnets requested or even returning
      different sized subnets than were requested. Additionally, usage
      statistics may be included in RENEW messages from the DHCP Client back
      to the DHCP Server.</t>

        <t></t>

        <t>The DHCP Server SHOULD NOT include the Subnet Request suboption in
        any replies to the DHCP Client. Enough information will be present in
        the Subnet-Information suboption, such that the Subnet Request
        suboption is not needed in replies to the Client.</t>

        <t>The DHCP Server SHOULD allocate a subnet with prefix length <xref
        target="RFC4632"> </xref> less than or equal to the "Prefix" field
        length specified in the request. In other words, a subnet containing a
        number of addresses at least the size indicated by the prefix length
        requested and possibly more. The DHCP Server MAY allocate a subnet
        with a prefix length greater than that specified in the request
        (subnet with a number of addresses less than requested), but this is
        not encouraged.</t>

        <t>A "Prefix" field size of 0 MAY be specified by the DHCP Client. In
        this case, no suggested prefix length is given.</t>

        <t>Multiple Subnet-Request suboptions in a DHCP packet indicate that
        multiple subnets are being requested. Note that multiple occurrances
        of this suboption MUST NOT be concatenated in the sense of <xref
        target="RFC3396"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Each Subnet-Request suboption MUST result in no more than one
        Subnet-Information suboption in the DHCPOFFER message from the Server,
        and may result in no Subnet-Information suboptions.</t>

        <t>The Client MAY also include the Subnet-Information suboption in
        order to request a particular subnet. In this case, the Client SHOULD
        only include one Subnet-Request suboption, since it would otherwise be
        unclear which Subnet-Information suboption refered to which
        Subnet-Request suboption. Multiple subnet requests can be made by
        sending multiple DHCPDISCOVER packets.</t>

        <t>Setting the 'h' flag to 1 indicates the Client will be allocating
        addresses from the allocated subnet(s) itself. This can be thought of
        as a "Hierarchial DHCP" design in that control of allocation for the
        subnet(s) will be passed to the Client.</t>

        <t>Setting the 'h' flag to 0 indicates the Client wants the DHCP
        Server to retain control over allocation of addresses from the
        subnet(s). Any address allocation requests on the subnet will be
        relayed back to the DHCP Server.</t>

        <t>Setting the 'i' flag to 1 indicates the Client is NOT seeking
        allocation of any subnets, but is simply seeking information from the
        Server as to what subnet(s) have been allocated (or reserved) for this
        Client. If the 'i' flag is set to 1, then the "Prefix" field SHOULD be
        set to 0 and MUST be ignored by the Server. In this case, the
        conversation between the Client and the Server will only progress to
        the DHCPOFFER packet from the Server, giving the information, as
        described in section 6 below.</t>

        <t>The "Client flag" ('c') is set to 1 if this Subnet-Information
        suboption is in response to a Client request for information from the
        Server as to what subnet(s) have been allocated. This flag is used in
        response to a Subnet-Request suboption with the 'i' flag set and
        should be 0 in other Server responses. Note, the flag is echoed back
        from the Client to the Server when requesting the "next previously
        allocated subnet". Another way to think of the 'c' bit would be that
        it indicates that the subnet information contained in this suboption
        does not represent a new allocation by the Server or a new request for
        allocation by the Client, but instead represents previously allocated
        subnet information.</t>

        <t>The "Server flag" ('s') is set to 1 if the Server has additional
        subnet information for the Client.</t>

        <t>The Subnet-Information suboption is used by the DHCP Server in
        order to return information as to what subnets are offered (in the
        case of a DHCPOFFER packet) or allocated (in the case of a DHCPACK
        packet). As is indicated above, multiple subnets may be returned in
        one Subnet-Information suboption.</t>

        <t>The Subnet-Information suboption is also used by the DHCP Client in
        order to request allocation of specific subnets in a DHCPREQUEST
        packet. In this case, the "Network", "Prefix", and "Flags" fields
        contained in the associated Subnet Prefix Information blocks MUST NOT
        be changed from the information which was received in the DHCPOFFER
        packet from the server. The Client MAY, however, use multiple
        Subnet-Information suboptions in order to request subnets which were
        originally specified by the Server inside one Subnet-Information
        suboption.</t>

          <t>The 'd' flag may only be returned by the Server to the Client
          (inside a DHCPACK packet, in response to a DHCP RENEW). It's
          presence means that the Client should prepare to give up the subnet.
          For example, if the Client is assigning addresses from this subnet
          to other clients, it should cease doing so immediately and should
          not renew any leases when clients ask for renewal. As soon as all
          addresses in the subnet are unallocated, the Client should send a
          DHCPRELEASE message to the Server, including a Subnet Prefix
          Information suboption for the subnet in order to release the subnet.
          The format of this message is described farther below.</t>

          <t>The 'h' flag tells the Client how the Server intends for the
          Client to use the allocated subnet. It is interpreted in the same
          manner as that in the Subnet-Request suboption. In response to a
          Subnet-Request, the Server should normally specify the 'h' flag in
          the same manner as it was in the Subnet-Request suboption from the
          Client. The Server MAY, however, change the 'h' flag from that
          specified in the Subnet-Request suboption if it has been configured
          to override the Client's request.</t>

          "Stat-len" field specifies the number of bytes of statistics
          information which is included. See below for more information. If no
          statistics information is included, then this byte MUST be zero. The
          "Stat-len" field SHOULD always be zero when this suboption is sent
          by the DHCP Server. The usage statistics information is intended for

        set the "Server flag" in the Subnet-Information suboption to indicate
        to the Client that it should send another subnet request to gather the
        others.</t>

        <t>The Client SHOULD use a lease time, when allocating addresses from

    <section title="Requesting allocation of a subnet">
      <section title="Client DHCPDISCOVER message">
        <t>The DHCP Client creates a DHCPDISCOVER message including the Subnet
        Allocation option, and its set of suboptions, to request allocation of
        a subnet. The DHCP Client should include the Subnet-Request suboption,
        specifying the prefix length of the subnet requested. The 'h' bit
        should be set to 1 if the Client intends to control allocation of
        addresses within the subnet itself, or 0 if the Server should retain
        control of addresses within the subnet. More than one Subnet
        Allocation option may appear in a DHCPDISCOVER message, however the
        client SHOULD limit the number of requests, noting that the DHCP
        replies will need to include the Subnet-Information suboption, which
        takes up more space than the Subnet-Request suboption.</t>

        <t>If more than one subnet is being requested, multiple Subnet-Request
        suboptions MAY be included or multiple DHCPDISCOVER messages MAY be
        sent instead. The prefix length field of each Subnet-Request suboption
        MUST be either 0, or in the range of 1 to 30 inclusive.</t>

        <t>The DHCP "IP address lease time" option (code 51) MAY be included
        in the DHCPDISCOVER message to specify the lease time the Client is
        requesting for the subnet. If not present, no suggested lease time is
        given.</t>

        <t>The DHCP "Client ID" option (code 61) MAY be included in the
        DHCPDISCOVER message as it may be used by the Server in performing the
        subnet allocation.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Server DHCPOFFER message">
        <t>Upon receiving a DHCPDISCOVER containing the Subnet Allocation
        option, the DHCP Server should respond with a DHCPOFFER message
        including the Subnet-Information suboption in order to specify the
        subnet(s) which it is willing to allocate to the Client in order to
        fulfill the request(s).</t>

        <t>The Server need not reserve the subnets which are being offered,
        but SHOULD strive to not offer the same subnets to another DHCP Client
        until a reasonable time period (implementation dependent) has passed.
        (This is similar to normal DHCP address allocation.)</t>

        <t>The Server MUST NOT include the Subnet-Request suboption in the
        DHCPOFFER. The same information is already present in the Subnet
        Information suboption(s) which SHOULD be included in the
        DHCPOFFER.</t>

        <t>The Server SHOULD also include the IP address lease time option
        (option 51) in the DHCPOFFER message. This gives the lease time for
        all subnets given in all Subnet-Request suboptions contained in the
        DHCPOFFER message. The Server MAY also include the Renewal and/or
        Rebinding options in order to further control the "T1" and "T2" lease
        timers of the client. There MUST be only one IP address lease time,
        rebind, and/or renew option each in the DHCPOFFER message.</t>

        <t>The Server MAY set the "Server flag" ('s') to 1 to indicate that it
        would like to allocate one or more additional subnet(s) to the Client.
        This indicates that the Client should send another DHCPDISCOVER
        message specifying a zero prefix length field, P, in order to request
        the additional subnet allocation(s) information. This may be necessary
        if the subnets are to be allocated with different lease times, for
        example.</t>

        <t>The "Client flag" ('c') MUST be set to 0 to indicate this is a
        Server response to a client request for a new subnet allocation and
        not a response to a request for information about already allocated
        subnets.</t>

        <t>The Server SHOULD set the DHCP yiaddr value to all zeros (0.0.0.0)
        and the Client MUST ignore fields having to do with address assignment
        if the packet contains a Subnet Allocation option. In other words, a
        DHCP packet exchange can not provide subnet allocation and address
        assignment simultaneously.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Client DHCPREQUEST message">
        <t>When sending a DHCPREQUEST, the Client MUST NOT modify any fields
        of all Subnet-Information suboptions received from the Server.
        However, the Client MAY choose not to include some Subnet-Information
        suboptions when issuing the DHCPREQUEST. Subnet-Request suboptions
        MUST NOT be included in the DHCPREQUEST message, only the
        Subnet-Information suboption(s) should be included.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Server DHCPACK message">
        <t>The DHCP Server, upon receipt of the Client's DHCPREQUEST message,
        MAY refuse allocation of any subnets (for example, if they have been
        allocated elsewhere in the meantime), however since the Server should
        have set aside the subnets offered for a short period of time, and
        since the Client should have requested the subnets within a short
        period of time after receiving the offer(s) from the server(s), this
        last minute rejection should be rare. The DHCP Server MUST NOT change
        the network number(s) or prefix length(s), however it MAY remove some
        Subnet-Information suboptions from the list.</t>

        <t>The Server SHOULD include the IP address lease time option
        specifying the lease period for all subnet(s) in the DHCPACK. All
        subnets allocated in one DHCP message will have the same lease time
        and only one IP address lease time option must appear in the DHCP
        message.</t>

        <t>If the Server has internal information which states that the Client
        should be allocated more subnets than were requested, the Server MAY
        set the 's' bit in the last Subnet-Information suboption to indicate
        that the Client needs to request more subnets (as described
        above).</t>

        <t>The allocable unit is the tuple (network number, prefix length).
        Multiple subnets may be allocated in one DHCPACK, however since there
        can be only one Lease-time option, each subnet allocated is assigned
        the same lease time. Each subnet lease tuple (network number, prefix
        length) MAY be renewed or released individually.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Client renewal of subnet lease">
      <section title="Client RENEW DHCPREQUEST message">
        <t>The Client MUST renew all subnets allocated with a lease time in
        much the same manner as renewing an allocated IP address. Renewal
        timers need not be set in exactly the same manner, however. If Renewal
        and/or Rebinding options were included in the DHCPACK of the subnet
        allocation, then these "T1" and "T2" timers should be used just as
        they would be in the case of address allocation timers.</t>

        <t>The DHCPREQUEST message MUST include a Subnet-Information suboption
        for which the Client is seeking renewal of the lease. This
        Subnet-Information suboption may optionally include subnet usage
        statistics, as described above in the Subnet-Information suboption
        format section (3.2).</t>

        <t>The subnet network number field ("Network") and subnet prefix
        length field ("Prefix") MUST agree with the values as they were
        originally allocated to the Client by the Server. In any of the
        statistics fields (High, Current, Unusable), a value of all ones
        (0xffff) SHOULD be used if the Client has no information to report for
        a statistic.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Server RENEW DHCPREQUEST response">
        <t>The Server MAY respond to a subnet RENEW with either a DHCPACK or
        DHCPNAK response. If a DHCPNAK response is given the Client MUST
        immediately stop using the subnet(s) specified and, if possible,
        notify all Clients with addresses allocated from this subnet that
        their addresses are no longer valid. The Client MAY, of course, send a
        DHCPDISCOVER message containing the Subnet Allocation option and the
        Subnet-Request suboption in order to acquire another subnet for use.
        In general, the Server should ask the Client to deprecate subnets by
        using the 'd' bit of the Subnet-Information suboption in a DHCPACK
        message (see below).</t>

        <t>If a DHCPACK response is given, the "Deprecate" ('d') bit of the
        flags field in the Subnet-Information suboption may also be set. This
        indicates the DHCP Client should "prepare to stop using this subnet".
        If the Client is allocating IP addresses for other clients from this
        subnet (e.g. via DHCP), the Client SHOULD immediately stop allocating
        such addresses. Once all allocated addresses in the subnet have been
        released, the Client SHOULD send a DHCPRELEASE message, including the
        Subnet-Information suboption (with optional usage statistics) in order
        to release the subnet(s) back to the Server.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Client DHCPRELEASE message">
        <t>The DHCP Client should send a DHCPRELEASE message in order to
        release allocated subnet(s) back to the Server when it is finished
        using them. This message MUST NOT include the Subnet-Request
        suboption, but MUST include one or more Subnet-Information suboptions,
        and optionally including usage statistics.</t>

        <t>The Client MUST release the same subnet(s) of the same prefix
        length ("Prefix"), as was originally allocated. The Client MAY release
        a subset of the subnets which were allocated originally. In other
        words, the allocable unit is the tuple (network number, prefix
        length). Multiple subnets may be allocated in one DHCPACK, however
        each subnet MAY be released individually.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Server DHCPFORCERENEW message">
        <t>The DHCP Server may issue a DHCPFORCERENEW <xref
        target="RFC3203"></xref> message containing the Subnet Allocation
        option and the Subnet-Information suboption. Upon receiving this
        message, the DHCP Client MUST issue a DHCPREQUEST message to the DHCP
        Server in order to renew the lease on the subnet mentioned. No other
        subnets allocated to the Client are effected. As is the case with all
        DHCP RENEW messages, the Client may include subnet usage information
        in the Subnet-Information suboption in order to report subnet usage
        statistics, or set the "Stat-len" field to 0 if no statistics are to
        be reported.</t>

        <t>If the Server responds to this DHCPREQUEST with a DHCPNAK message,
        then the Client MUST immediately stop using the subnet(s) and, if
        possible, notify all Clients with addresses allocated from this/these
        subnet(s) that their addresses are no longer valid. The Client MAY, of
        course, send a DHCPDISCOVER message containing the Subnet Allocation
        option and the Subnet-Request suboption in order to acquire another
        subnet for use.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Client requesting previously allocated subnet information">
      <t>A DHCP Client may request from the DHCP Server a list of what subnets
      are currently allocated to the Client. This may be used to recover from
      a restart if the Client does not have local storage in order to retain
      the information itself. (For example of this, see the section 8.2
      below.)</t>

      <section title="Client Initial DHCPDISCOVER Message">
        <t>The DHCP Client DHCPDISCOVER message, when used to discover already
        allocated subnet information, should contain a Subnet-Request
        suboption with the "Prefix" field set to 0 and with the 'i' flag set
        to 1 to indicate that the Client is seeking already allocated subnet
        information from the Server. No Subnet-Information suboptions should
        be included in this message. Note, no Subnet-Information suboption is
        included in this message, since the client would not know of any
        subnet to request at this point.</t>

        <t>This DHCPDISCOVER message MAY be unicast to a particular DHCP
        Server, or broadcast in the normal fashion.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Server Initial DHCPOFFER Response">
        <t>Any DHCP Server which has allocated subnets to the Client should
        respond to the DHCPDISCOVER message with a DHCPOFFER message. The
        DHCPOFFER message should contain one or more Subnet-Information
        suboption(s) telling the prefix of the subnet(s) allocated to the
        Client.</t>

        <t>The Server SHOULD, internally, retain an ordered list of subnets
        which are allocated to each Client. In response to an initial
        DHCPDISCOVER message requesting allocated subnet information (i.e.,
        one with the 'i' flag set to 1, but not carrying a Subnet-Information
        suboption), the server returns in the DHCPOFFER message the subnet(s)
        information for the first subnet(s) from this list. If the end of the
        list has been reached, then the 's' bit of the last Subnet-Information
        suboption included in the message MUST be set to 0. If there are more
        subnets in the list, the 's' bit MUST be set to 1 to indicate to the
        Client that more information is available. Since this information is
        in response to a client request for previously allocated subnet
        information, the 'c' bit MUST be set to 1.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Client Additional DHCPDISCOVER Messages">
        <t>The Client, upon receiving any Server DHCPOFFER messages containing
        Subnet Information suboption information with the 'c' ("Client") bit
        set, should gather the network number ("Network") and prefix length
        ("Prefix") information from the message.</t>

        <t>If the 's' bit is set in the last of the Subnet-Information
        suboptions included in the message, then the client SHOULD construct a
        new DHCPDISCOVER message containing the Subnet Allocation option and
        the last Subnet-Information suboption from the Server's message. This
        message SHOULD then be sent back to the same DHCP Server originating
        the DHCPOFFER message. The 'c' and 's' bits MUST retain the same
        settings they had from the Server's DHCPOFFER message and the network
        number ("Network") and prefix length ("Prefix") fields MUST be
        unaltered as well.</t>

        <t>If the 's' bit in all of the Subnet-Information suboptions from the

        information about the next set of subnets allocated to this Client. If
        this finishes the list in the table for this Client, then the 's' bit
        MUST be set to 0 to indicate there is no more information. Any Subnet

    <section title="Differences from DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation">
      <t>The following differences may be noticed between Subnet Allocation as
      described in this document and DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation as described in
      <xref target="RFC3633"></xref>:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>This option does not use anything like an "IA_PD" as is used in
          DHCPv6.</t>

          <t>If the Server can not allocate a subnet, it remains silent,
          instead of returning a special response saying nothing is
          available.</t>

          <t>DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation has no mechanism for returning
          subnet/prefix usage statistics.</t>

          <t>DHCPv6 has no equivalent to the "subnet deprecation" flag as
          described here.</t>

          <t>DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation makes no mention of what Client actions
          should result from receiving a DHCPNAK during a RENEW of a
          delegation.</t>

          <t>DHCPv6 has no equivalent of the subnet allocation "Network name"
          suboption, which may be used by the Server for various purposes,
          such as to specify a pool to use when allocating a subnet.</t>

          <t>DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation corresponds to "Hierarchical Subnet
          Allocation" (setting the 'h' flag in the Prefix Information
          suboption). There is no V6 equivalent of clearing the 'h' flag, in
          which the Server retains authority over allocation of addresses from
          the subnet.</t>

          <t>DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation has nothing to correspond to the
          Suggested-Lease-Time suboption.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Potential exposures to attack are discussed in section 7 of the DHCP
      protocol specification <xref target="RFC2131"></xref>. The Subnet
      Allocation option can be used to hoard all allocable subnets on a
      network.</t>

      <t>Implementations should consider using the DHCP Authentication option
      <xref target="RFC3118"></xref> in order to provide a higher level of
      security if it is deemed necessary in their environment. Potential
      exposures to attack are discussed in section 7 of the DHCP protocol
      specification in <xref target="RFC2131"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is requested to assign DHCP option number 220 for this option,
      in accordance with <xref target="RFC3942"></xref>.</t>

      <t>No assignment of values for the suboption codes need be made at this
      time. New values may only be defined by IETF Consensus, as described in
      <xref target="RFC5226"></xref>. Basically, this means that they are
      defined by RFCs approved by the IESG.</t>

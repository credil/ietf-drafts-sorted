1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   Most protocol developers ask themselves if a protocol will work, or
   work efficiently.  These are important questions, but another less
   frequently considered question is whether the proposed protocol
   presents itself needless barriers to adoption by deployed software.

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] software implementors are not merely faced with the
   task of handling a given option's format on the wire.  The option
   must fit into every stage of the system's process, starting with the
   user interface used to enter the configuration up to the machine
   interfaces where configuration is ultimately consumed.

   Another frequently overlooked aspect of rapid adoption is whether the
   option requires operators to be intimately familiar with the option's
   internal format in order to use it?  Most DHCPv6 software provides a
   facility for handling unknown options at the time of publication.
   The handling of such options usually needs to be manually configured
   by the operator.  But if doing so requires extensive reading (more
   than can be covered in a simple FAQ for example), it inhibits
   adoption.

   So although a given solution would work, and might even be space,
   time, or aesthetically optimal, a given option is presented with a
   series of ever-worsening challenges to be adopted:

   o  If it doesn't fit neatly into existing config files.

   o  If it requires source code changes to be adopted, and hence
      upgrades of deployed software.

   o  If it does not share its deployment fate in a general manner with
      other options, standing alone in requiring code changes or
      reworking configuration file syntaxes.

   o  If the option would work well in the particular deployment
      environment the proponents currently envision, but has equally
      valid uses in some other environment where the proposed option
      format would fail or would produce inconsistent results.

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Option Guidelines               June 2013


   There are many things DHCPv6 option creators can do to avoid the
   pitfalls in this list entirely, or failing that, to make software
   implementors lives easier and improve its chances for widespread
   adoption.

3.  When to Use DHCPv6

   Principally, DHCPv6 carries configuration parameters for its clients.
   Any knob, dial, slider, or checkbox on the client system, such as "my
   domain name servers", "my hostname", or even "my shutdown
   temperature" are candidates for being configured by DHCPv6.

   The presence of such a knob isn't enough, because DHCPv6 also
   presents the extension of an administrative domain - the operator of
   the network to which the client is currently attached.  Someone runs
   not only the local switching network infrastructure that the client
   is directly (or wirelessly) attached to, but the various methods of
   accessing the external Internet via local assist services that the
   network must also provide (such as domain name servers, or routers).
   This means that in addition to the existence of a configuration
   parameter, one must also ask themselves if it is reasonable for this
   parameter to be set by the directly attached network's
   administrators.

   Note that the client is not required to configure any of these values
   received via DHCPv6 (for example, due to having a value manually
   configured by its own operator).  Bear in mind that doing so might
   cause the client to be rejected network attachment privileges, and
   this is one of the main reasons for the use of DHCPv6 in corporate
   enterprises.

4.  General Principles

   The primary guiding principle to follow in order to enhance an
   option's adoptability is reuse.  The option should be created in such
   a way that does not require any new or special case software to
   support.  If old software currently deployed and in the field can
   adopt the option through supplied configuration facilities then it's
   fairly certain that new software can easily formally adopt it.

   There are at least two classes of DHCPv6 options: simple options
   which are provided explicitly to carry data from one side of the
   DHCPv6 exchange to the other (such as nameservers, domain names, or
   time servers), and a protocol class of options which require special
   processing on the part of the DHCPv6 software or are used during
   special processing (such as the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
   option [RFC4704]), and so forth; these options carry data that is the
   result of a routine in some DHCPv6 software.

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Option Guidelines               June 2013


   The guidelines laid out here should be applied in a relaxed manner
   for the protocol class of options.  Wherever special case code is
   already required to adopt the DHCPv6 option, it is substantially more
   reasonable to format the option in a less generic fashion, if there
   are measurable benefits to doing so.

5.  Reusing Other Options

   The easiest approach to manufacturing trivially deployable DHCPv6
   Options is to assemble the option out of whatever common fragments
   fit - possibly allowing a group of data elements to repeat to fill
   the remaining space (if present) and so provide multiple values.
   Place all fixed size values at the start of the option, and any
   variable/indeterminate sized value at the tail end of the option.

   This means that implementations will likely be able to reuse code
   paths designed to support the other options.

   There is a tradeoff between the adoptability of previously defined
   option formats, and the advantages that new or specialized formats
   can provide.  In general, it is usually preferable to reuse
   previously used option formats.

   However, it isn't very practical to consider the bulk of DHCPv6
   options already allocated, and consider which of those solve a
   similar problem.  So, the following list of common option format data
   elements is provided as a shorthand.  Please note that it is not
   complete in terms of exampling every option format ever devised.

5.1.  Option with IPv6 addresses

   This option format is used to carry one or many IPv6 addresses.  In
   some cases the number of allowed address is limited (e.g. to one):

      0                   1                   2                   3

     |                         ipv6-address                          |

     |                                                               |

   o  NTP server [RFC5908] (a single address only)

   o  NTP Multicast address [RFC5908] (a single address only)

5.2.  Option with a single flag (boolean)

   Sometimes it is useful to convey a single flag that can either take
   on or off values.  Instead of specifying an option with one bit of
   usable data and 7 bits of padding, it is better to define an option
   without any content.  It is the presence or absence of the option
   that conveys the value.  This approach has the additional benefit of
   absent option designating the default, i.e. administrator has to take
   explicit actions to deploy the opposite of the default value.

      0                   1                   2                   3

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Option Guidelines               June 2013


5.3.  Option with IPv6 prefix

   Sometimes there is a need to convey an IPv6 prefix.  The information
   to be carried by such an option includes the 128-bit IPv6 prefix
   together with a length of this prefix taking values from 0 to 128.
   Using the simplest approach, the option could convey this data in two
   fixed length fields: one carrying prefix length, another carrying the
   prefix.  However, in many cases /64 or shorter prefixes are used.
   This implies that the large part of the prefix data carried by the
   option would have its bits set to zero and would be unused.  In order
   to avoid carrying unused data, it is recommended to store prefix in
   the variable length data field.  The appropriate option format is
   defined as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |          option-code          |         option-length         |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |  prefix6-len  |              ipv6-prefix                      |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+           (variable length)                   |
     .                                                               .
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                     Figure 3: Option with IPv6 Prefix

   option-length is set to 1 + length of the IPv6 prefix.

   prefix6-len is one octet long and specifies the length in bits of the
   IPv6 prefix.  Typically allowed values are 0 to 128.

   ipv6-prefix field is a variable length field that specifies the IPv6
   prefix.  The length is (prefix6-len + 7) / 8.  This field is padded
   with zero bits up to the nearest octet boundary when prefix6-len is
   not divisible by 8.

   Examples of use:

   o  Default Mapping Rule [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp]

   For example, the prefix 2001:db8::/60 would be encoded with an
   option-length of 9, prefix6-len would be set to 60, the ipv6-prefix
   would be 8 octets and would contain octets 20 01 0d b8 00 00 00 00.

   It should be noted that the IAPREFIX option defined by [RFC3633] uses
   a full length 16-octet prefix field.  The concern about option length
   was not well understood at the time of its publication.

   integer value:

5.7.  Option with URI

   A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] is a compact sequence
   of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  The
   term "Uniform Resource Locator" (URL) refers to the subset of URIs
   that, in addition to identifying a resource, provide a means of
   locating the resource by describing its primary access mechanism
   (e.g., its network "location").  This option format can be used to
   carry a single URI:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   The uri-len is two octets long and specifies the length of the uri
   data.

5.8.  Option with Text String

   A text string is a sequence of characters that have no semantics.
   The encoding (such as 7-bit ASCII, NVT-ASCII, UTF-8) of the text
   string MUST be specified.  If a data format has semantics other than
   just being text, it is not a string.  E.g., a FQDN is not a string,
   and a URI is also not a string, because they have different
   semantics.  A string must not enclude any terminator (such as a null
   byte).  This option format can be used to carry a text string:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   The text-len is two octets long and specifies the length of the

5.9.  Option with variable length data

   This option can be used to carry variable length data of any kind.
   Internal representation of carried data is option specific.  Whenever
   this format is used by the new option being defined, the data
   encoding should be documented.

   This option format provides a lot of flexibility to pass data of
   almost any kind.  Though, whenever possible it is highly recommended
   to use more specialized options, with field types better matching
   carried data types.

5.10.  Option with DNS Wire Format Domain Name List

   This option is used to carry 'domain search' lists or any host or
   domain name.  It uses the same format as described in Section 5.9,
   but with the special data encoding, described in section 8 of
   [RFC3315].  This data encoding supports carrying multiple instances
   of hosts or domain names in a single option, by terminating each
   instance with the byte value of 0.

      0                   1                   2                   3

6.  Avoid Conditional Formatting

   Placing an octet at the start of the option which informs the
   software how to process the remaining octets of the option may appear
   simple to the casual observer.  But the only conditional formatting
   methods that are in widespread use today are 'protocol' class
   options.  Therefore conditional formatting requires new code to be
   written and complicates future interoperability should new
   conditional formats be added; and existing code has to ignore
   conditional format that it does not support.

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Option Guidelines               June 2013


7.  Avoid Aliasing

   Options are said to be aliases of each other if they provide input to
   the same configuration parameter.  A commonly proposed example is to
   configure the location of some new service ("my foo server") using a
   binary IP address, a domain name field, and an URL.  This kind of
   aliasing is undesirable, and is not recommended.

   In this case, where three different formats are supposed, it more
   than triples the work of the software involved, requiring support for
   not merely one format, but support to produce and digest all three.
   Furthermore, code development and testing must cover all possible
   combinations of defined formats.  Since clients cannot predict what
   values the server will provide, they must request all formats.  So in
   the case where the server is configured with all formats, DHCPv6
   message bandwidth is wasted on option contents that are redundant.
   Also, the DHCPv6 option space is wasted, as three new option codes
   are required, rather than one.

   It also becomes unclear which types of values are mandatory, and how
   configuring some of the options may influence the others.  For
   example, if an operator configures the URL only, should the server
   synthesize a domain name and IP address?

   A single configuration value on a host is probably presented to the
   operator (or other software on the machine) in a single field or
   channel.  If that channel has a natural format, then any alternative
   formats merely make more work for intervening software in providing
   conversions.

   So the best advice is to choose the one method that best fulfills the
   requirements, be that for simplicity (such as with an IP address and
   port pair), late binding (such as with DNS), or completeness (such as
   with a URL).

8.  Choosing between FQDN and address

   Some parameters may be specified as FQDN or an address.  It is not
   allowed to define both option types at the same time (see section
   Section 7), so one of them must be chosen.  This section is intended
   to help make an informed decision in that regard.

   On the specific subject of desiring to configure a value using a FQDN
   instead of a binary IP address, note that most DHCPv6 server
   implementations will happily accept a Domain Name entered by the
   administrator, and use DNS resolution to render binary IP addresses
   in DHCPv6 replies to clients.  Consequently, consider the extra
   packet overhead incurred on the client's end to perform DNS



Hankins, et al.         Expires December 31, 2013              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Option Guidelines               June 2013


   resolution itself.  The client may be operating on a battery and
   packet transmission is a non-trivial use of power, and the extra RTT
   delays the client must endure before the service is configured are at
   least two factors to consider in making a decision on format.

   Unless there are specific reasons to do otherwise, address should be
   used.  It is simpler to use, its validation is trivial (length of 16
   constitutes a valid option), is explicit and does not allow any
   ambiguity.  It is faster (does not require extra resolution efforts),
   so it is more efficient, which can be especially important for energy
   restricted devices.

   FQDN options are discouraged for options intended to configure hosts,
   because hosts may have multiple provisioning domains (see
   Section 12), and may get a different answer from the DNS depending on
   the provisioning domain.  This is particularly a problem when the
   normal expected use of the option makes sense with private DNS
   zone(s), as might be the case with a corporate VPN.

   FQDN does require a resolution into an actual address.  This implies
   the question when the FQDN resolution should be taken.  There are a
   couple of possible answers: a) by the server, when it is started, b)
   by the server, when it is about to send an option, c) by the client,
   immediately after receiving an option, d) by the client, when the
   content of the option is actually consumed.  For a), b) and possibly
   c), the option should really convey an address, not FQDN.  The only
   real incentive to use FQDN is case d).  It is the only case that
   allows possible changes in the DNS to be picked up by clients.

   FQDN imposes a number of additional failure modes and issues that
   should be dealt with:

   1.  The client must have a knowledge about available DNS servers.
       That typically means that option DNS_SERVERS is mandatory.  This
       should be mentioned in the draft that defines new option.  It is
       possible that the server will return FQDN option, but not the DNS
       Servers option.  There should be a brief discussion about it;

   2.  The DNS may not be reachable;

   3.  DNS may be available, but may not have appropriate information
       (e.g. no AAAA records for specified FQDN);

   4.  Address family must be specified (A, AAAA or any);

   5.  What should the client do if there are multiple records available
       (use only the first one, use all, use one and switch to the
       second if the first fails for whatever reason, etc.);

   6.  Multi-homed devices may be connected to different administrative
       domains with each domain providing different information in DNS
       (e.g. an enterprise network exposing private domains).  Client
       may send DNS queries to a different DNS server;

   7.  It should be mentioned if Internationalized Domain Names are
       allowed.  If they are, what kind of DNS option encoding should be
       specified.

9.  Encapsulated options in DHCPv6

   Most options are conveyed in a DHCPv6 message directly.  Although
   there is no codified normative language for such options, they are
   often referred to as top-level options.  Many options may include
   other options.  Such inner options are often referred to as
   encapsulated or nested options.  Those options are sometimes called
   sub-options, but this term actually means something else, and
   therefore should never be used to describe encapsulated options.  It
   is recommended to use term "encapsulated" as this terminology is used
   in [RFC3315].  The difference between encapsulated and sub-options
   are that the former uses normal DHCPv6 option space codes, while the
   latter uses option space specific to a given parent option.  It
   should be noted that, contrary to DHCPv4, there is no shortage of
   option numbers.  Therefore almost all options share a common option
   space.  For example option type 1 meant different things in DHCPv4,
   depending if it was located in top-level or inside of Relay Agent
   Information option.  There is no such ambiguity in DHCPv6 (with the
   unfortunate exception of [RFC5908], which never got proper review
   from the DHC working group and contains many errors, and should not
   under any circumstances be used as a template for future DHCP option
   definitions).

   From the implementation perspective, it is easier to implement
   encapsulated options rather than sub-options, as the implementers do
   not have to deal with separate option spaces and can use the same
   buffer parser in several places throughout the code.

   Such encapsulation is not limited to one level.  There is at least
   one defined option that is encapsulated twice: Identity Association
   for Prefix Delegation (IA_PD, defined in [RFC3633], section 9)
   conveys IA Prefix (IAPREFIX, defined in [RFC3633], section 10).  Such
   delegated prefix may contain an excluded prefix range that is
   represented by PD_EXCLUDE option that is conveyed as encapsulated
   inside IAPREFIX (PD_EXCLUDE, defined in [RFC6603]).  It seems awkward
   to refer to such options as sub-sub-option or doubly encapsulated
   option, therefore "encapsulated option" term is typically used,
   regardless of the nesting level.

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Option Guidelines               June 2013


   When defining configuration means for more complex mechanisms, it may
   be tempting to simply use sub-options.  That should be avoided, as it
   increases complexity of the parser.  It is much easier, faster and
   less error prone to parse a larger number of options on a single
   (top-level) scope, than parse options on several scopes.  The use of
   sub-options should be avoided as much as possible, but it is better
   to use sub-options rather than conditional formatting.

   It should be noted that currently there is no clear way defined for
   requesting sub-options.  Most known implementations are simply using
   top-level ORO for requesting both top-level options and encapsulated
   options.

10.  Additional States Considered Harmful

   DHCP is a protocol designed for provisioning clients.  Less
   experienced protocol designers often assume that it is easy to define
   an option that will convey a different parameter for each client in a
   network.  Such problems arose during designs of MAP
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp] and 4rd [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd].  While
   it would be easier for provisioned clients to get ready to use per
   client option values, such requirement puts exceedingly large loads
   on the server side.  The new extensions may introduce new
   implementation complexity and additional database state on the
   server.  Alternatives should be considered, if possible.  As an
   example, [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp] was designed in a way that all
   clients are provisioned with the same set of MAP options and each
   provisioned client uses its unique address and delegated prefix to
   generate client-specific information.  Such a solution does not
   introduce any additional state for the server and therefore scales
   better.

   It also should be noted that contrary to DHCPv4, DHCPv6 keeps several
   timers for renewals.  Each IA_NA (addresses) and IA_PD (prefixes)
   contains T1 and T2 timers that designate time after which client will
   initiate renewal.  Those timers apply only to its own IA containers.
   Refreshing other parameters should be initiated after a time
   specified in the Information Refresh Time Option (defined in
   [RFC4242]), carried in the Reply message and returned in response to
   Information-Request message.  Introducing additional timers make
   deployment unnecessarily complex and SHOULD be avoided.

11.  Configuration changes occur at fixed times

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Option Guidelines               June 2013


   In general, DHCPv6 clients only refresh configuration data from the
   DHCP server when the T1 timer expires.  Although there is a
   RECONFIGURE mechanism that allows a DHCP server to request that
   clients initiate reconfiguration, support for this mechanism is
   optional and cannot be relied upon.

   Even when DHCP clients refresh their configuration information, not
   all consumers of DHCP-sourced configuration data notice these
   changes.  For instance, if a server is started using parameters
   received in an early DHCP transaction, but does not check for updates
   from DHCP, it may well continue to use the same parameter
   indefinitely.  Modern notification systems take care of reconfiguring
   services when the client moves to a new network, but it's worth
   bearing in mind that a renew may not actually result in the client
   taking up new configuration information that it receives.

   In light of the above, when designing an option you should take into
   consideration the fact that your option may hold stale data that will
   only be updated at an arbitrary time in the future.

12.  Multiple provisioning domains

   In some cases there could be more than one DHCPv6 server on a link,
   with each provisioning a different set of parameters.  One notable
   example of such a case is a home network with a connection to two
   independent ISPs.

   DHCPv6 was not initially designed with multiple provisioning domains.
   Although [RFC3315] states that a client that receives more than one
   ADVERTISE message, may respond to one or more of them, such
   capability was never observed in any known implementations.  Existing
   clients will pick one server and will continue configuration process
   with that server, ignoring all other servers.

   This is a generic DHCP protocol issue and should not be dealt within
   each option separately.  This issue is better dealt with using a
   protocol-level solution and fixing this problem should not be
   attempted on a per option basis.

13.  Chartering Requirements and Advice for Responsible ADs

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Option Guidelines               June 2013


   Adding a simple DHCP option is straightforward, and generally
   something that any working group can do, perhaps with some help from
   designated DHCP experts.  However, when new fragment types need to be
   devised, this requires the attention of DHCP experts, and should not
   be done in a working group that doesn't have a quorum of such
   experts.  This is true whether the new fragment type has the same
   structure as an existing fragment type, but has different semantics.
   It is equally true when the new format has a new structure.

   Responsible Area Directors for working groups that wish to add a work
   item to a working group charter to define a new DHCP option should
   get clarity from the working group as to whether the new option is a
   simple DHCP option with no new fragment type or new fragment
   semantics, or whether it in fact will require new fragment types.  A
   working group charter item should explicitly state which of these two
   types is required; if it is not known at the time of chartering, the
   charter should state that the working group will study the question
   and recharter or seek help elsewhere if a new fragment type is to be
   defined.

   If a working group needs a new fragment type, it is preferable to
   seek out a working group whose members already have sufficient
   expertise to evaluate the new work and try to come up with a new
   format that generalizes well and can be reused, rather than a single-
   use fragment type.  If such a working group is available, the work
   should be chartered in that working group as a separate draft that
   documents the new fragment type.  The working group that needs the
   new fragment type can then define their new option referencing the
   new fragment type document.  This work can generally be done in
   parallel so as not to delay the process significantly.

   In the event that there is no working group with DHCP expertise that
   can define the new fragment type, the responsible AD should seek out
   help from known DHCP experts within the IETF to provide advice and
   frequent early review as the working group defines the new fragment
   type.  The new fragment type should still be done in a separate
   document, even if it's done in the same working group, so as to
   foster reuse of the new fragment type.  The responsible AD should
   work with the working group chairs and designated DHCP experts to
   ensure that new fragment type document has in fact been carefully
   reviewed by the experts and appears satisfactory.

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Option Guidelines               June 2013


   Responsible area directors for working groups that are considering
   defining options that actually update the DHCP protocol, as opposed
   to simple options, should go through a process similar to that
   described above when trying to determine where to do the work.  Under
   no circumstances should a working group be given a charter
   deliverable to define a new DHCP option, and then on the basis of
   that charter item actually make updates to the DHCP protocol.

14.  Considerations for Creating New Formats

   When defining new options, one specific consideration to evaluate is
   whether or not options of a similar format would need to have
   multiple or single values encoded (whatever differs from the current
   option), and how that might be accomplished in a similar format.

   When defining a new option, it is best to synthesize the option
   format using fragment types already in use.  However, in some cases
   there may be no fragment type that accomplishes the intended purpose.

   The matter of size considerations and option order are further
   discussed in Section 15 and Section 17.

15.  Option Size

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] allows for packet sizes up to 64KB.  First, through
   its use of link-local addresses, it avoids many of the deployment
   problems that plague DHCPv4, and is actually an UDP over IPv6 based
   protocol (compared to DHCPv4, which is mostly UDP over IPv4 protocol,
   but with layer 2 hacks).  Second, RFC 3315 explicitly refers readers
   to RFC 2460 Section 5, which describes an MTU of 1280 octets and a
   minimum fragment reassembly of 1500 octets.  It's feasible to suggest
   that DHCPv6 is capable of having larger options deployed over it, and
   at least no common upper limit is yet known to have been encoded by
   its implementors.  It is impossible to describe any fixed limit that
   cleanly divides those too big from the workable.

   It is advantageous to prefer option formats which contain the desired
   information in the smallest form factor that satisfies the
   requirements.  Common sense still applies here.  It is better to
   split distinct values into separate octets rather than propose overly
   complex bit shifting operations to save several bits (or even an
   octet or two) that would be padded to the next octet boundary anyway.

   DHCPv6 does allow for multiple instances of a given option, and they
   are treated as distinct values following the defined format, however
   this feature is generally preferred to be restricted to protocol
   class features (such as the IA_* series of options).  In such cases,
   it is better to define an option as an array if it is possible.  It



Hankins, et al.         Expires December 31, 2013              [Page 19]

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Option Guidelines               June 2013


   is recommended to clarify (with normative language) whether a given
   DHCPv6 option may appear once or multiple times.  The default
   assumption is only once.

   Relay agents have to do fragment reassembly and fragmentation on
   transmission.  So while fragmentation is allowed, if a new option
   results in significant fragmentation, it probably isn't a good choice
   for DHCP configuration; instead DHCP should simply point to a URI
   where the configuration information can be obtained.

16.  Singleton options

   Although [RFC3315] states that each option type MAY appear more than
   once, the original idea was that multiple instances are reserved for
   stateful options, like IA_NA or IA_PD.  For most other options it is
   usually expected that they will appear at most once.  Such options
   are called singleton options.  Sadly, it is often not clearly
   specified in RFCs that were published up to this date whether only
   one or more option instances are allowed.  Documents that define new
   defined options SHOULD state whether new options are singletons or
   not.  Unless otherwise specified, new defined options are singletons.

   When deciding whether a single or multiple option instances are
   allowed in a message, take into consideration how the content of the
   option will be used.  Depending on the service being configured it
   may or may not make sense to have multiple values configured.  If
   multiple values make sense, it is better to explicitly allow that by
   using option format that allows multiple values within one option
   instance.

   Allowing multiple option instances often leads to confusion.
   Consider the following example.  Basic DS-Lite architecture assumes
   that the B4 element (DHCPv6 client) will receive AFTR option and
   establish a single tunnel to configured tunnel termination point
   (AFTR).  During standardization process of [RFC6334] there was a
   discussion whether multiple instances of DS-Lite tunnel option should
   be allowed.  This created an unfounded expectation that the clients
   receiving multiple instances of the option will somehow know when one
   tunnel endpoint goes off-line and do some sort of failover between
   other values provided in other instances of the AFTR option.  Others
   assumed that if there are multiple options, the client will somehow
   do a load balancing between provided tunnel endpoints.  Neither
   failover nor load balancing was defined for DS-Lite architecture, so
   it caused confusion.  It was eventually decided to allow only one
   instance of the AFTR option.

17.  Option Order




Hankins, et al.         Expires December 31, 2013              [Page 20]

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Option Guidelines               June 2013


   Option order, either the order among many DHCPv6 options or the order
   of multiple instances of the same option, SHOULD NOT be significant
   and MUST NOT be assumed.  An exception may be security relevant
   options, which are often created last and put at the last position,
   or whose location indicates the protected range.

   As there is no explicit order for multiple instance of the same
   option, an option definition SHOULD instead restrict the order within
   the option by using a list of items rather than a single item.

18.  Relay Options

   In DHCPv4, all relay options are organized as sub-options within DHCP
   Relay Agent Information Option[RFC3046].  And an independent number
   space called "DHCP Relay Agent Sub-options" is maintained by IANA.
   Different from DHCPv4, in DHCPv6, Relay options are defined in the
   same way as client/server options, and they too use the same number
   space as client/server options.  Future DHCPv6 Relay options MUST be
   allocated from this single DHCPv6 Option code space.

   However, the Relay-Supplied Options Option [RFC6422] may also contain
   some DHCPv6 options as permitted, such as the EAP Re-authentication
   Protocol (ERP) Local Domain Name DHCPv6 Option [RFC6440].

19.  Clients Request their Options

   The DHCPv6 Option Request Option (OPTION_ORO) [RFC3315], is an option
   that serves two purposes - to inform the server what options the
   client supports and to inform what options the client is willing to
   consume.

   It doesn't make sense for some options to be requested using Option
   Request Option, such as those formed by elements of the protocol's
   internal workings, or are formed on either end by DHCPv6-level
   software engaged in some exchange of information.  When in doubt, it
   is prudent to assume that any new option must be present on the
   relevant option request list if the client desires to receive it.

   It is tempting to add text that requires the client to include a new
   option in Option Request Option list, similar to this text: "Clients
   MUST place the foo option code on the Option Request Option list,
   clients MAY include option foo in their packets as hints for the
   server as values the desire, and servers MUST include option foo when
   the client requested it (and the server has been so configured)".
   Such text is discouraged as there are several issues with it.  First,
   it assumes that client implementation that supports a given option
   will always want to use it.  This is not true.  The second and more
   important reason is that such text essentially duplicates mechanism



Hankins, et al.         Expires December 31, 2013              [Page 21]

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Option Guidelines               June 2013


   already defined in [RFC3315].  It is better to simply refer to the
   existing mechanism rather than define it again.  See Section 21 for
   proposed examples on how to do that.

   Creators of DHCPv6 options should not require special ordering of
   options either in the relevant request option, or in the order of
   options within the packet.  Although it is reasonable to expect that
   options will be processed in the order they appear in ORO, server
   software is not required to sort DHCPv6 options into the same order
   in reply messages.

   It should also be noted that options values are never aligned within
   the DHCP packet, even the option code and option length may appear on
   odd byte boundaries.

20.  Transition Technologies

   Transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is progressing.  Many transition
   technologies are proposed to speed it up.  As a natural consequence
   there are also DHCP options proposed to provision those proposals.
   The inevitable question is whether the required parameters should be
   delivered over DHCPv4 or DHCPv6.  Authors often don't give much
   thought about it and simply pick DHCPv6 without realizing the
   consequences.  IPv6 is expected to stay with us for many decades, and
   so is DHCPv6.  There is no mechanism available to deprecate an option
   in DHCPv6, so any options defined will stay with us as long as DHCPv6
   protocol itself.  It seems likely that such options defined to
   transition from IPv4 will outlive IPv4 by many decades.  From that
   perspective it is better to implement provisioning of the transition
   technologies in DHCPv4, which will be obsoleted together with IPv4.

   When the network infrastructure becomes IPv6-only, the support for
   IPv4-only nodes may still be needed.  In this scenario, provisioning
   IPv4 configuration over IPv6-only networks
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-v4configuration] may be needed.

21.  Recommended sections in the new document

   There are three major entities in DHCPv6 protocol: server, relay
   agent, and client.  It is very helpful for implementers to include
   separate sections that describe operation for those three major
   entities.  Even when a given entity does not participate, it is
   useful to have a very short section stating that it must not send a
   given option and must ignore it when received.

   There is also a separate entity called requestor, which is a special
   client-like type that participates in leasequery protocol [RFC5007]
   and [RFC5460].  A similar section for the requestor is not required,



Hankins, et al.         Expires December 31, 2013              [Page 22]

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Option Guidelines               June 2013


   unless the new option has anything to do with requestor (or it is
   likely that the reader may think that is has).  It should be noted
   that while in the majority of deployments, requestor is co-located
   with relay agent, those are two separate entities from the protocol
   perspective and they may be used separately.  There are stand-alone
   requestor implementations available.

   The following sections include proposed text for such sections.  That
   text is not required to appear, but it is appropriate in most cases.
   Additional or modified text specific to a given option is often
   required.

   Although requestor is somewhat uncommon functionality, its existence
   should be noted, especially when allowing or disallowing options to
   appear in certain message or being sent by certain entities.
   Additional message types may appear in the future, besides types
   defined in [RFC3315].  Therefore authors are encouraged to
   familiarize themselves with a list of currently defined DHCPv6
   messages available on IANA website [iana].

   Typically new options are requested by clients and assigned by the
   server, so there is no specific relay behavior.  Nevertheless it is
   good to include a section for relay agent behavior and simply state
   that there are no additional requirements for relays.  The same
   applies for client behavior if the options are to be exchanged
   between relay and server.

   Sections that contain option definitions MUST include formal
   verification procedure.  Often it is very simple, e.g. option that
   conveys IPv6 address must be exactly 16 bytes long, but sometimes the
   rules are more complex.  It is recommeded to refer to existing
   documents (e.g. section 8 of RFC3315 for domain name encoding) rather
   than trying to repeat such rules.

21.1.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior Text

   Clients MAY request option foo, as defined in [RFC3315], sections
   17.1.1, 18.1.1, 18.1.3, 18.1.4, 18.1.5 and 22.7.  As a convenience to
   the reader, we mention here that the client includes requested option
   codes in Option Request Option.

   Optional text (if client's hints make sense): Client also MAY include
   option foo in its SOLICIT, REQUEST, RENEW, REBIND and INFORMATION-
   REQUEST messages as a hint for the server regarding preferred option
   values.

   Optional text (if the option contains FQDN): If the client requests
   an option that conveys an FQDN, it is expected that the contents of



Hankins, et al.         Expires December 31, 2013              [Page 23]

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Option Guidelines               June 2013


   that option will be resolved using DNS.  Hence the following text may
   be useful: Clients that request option foo SHOULD also request option
   OPTION_DNS_SERVERS specified in [RFC3646].

   Clients MUST discard option foo if it is invalid (i.e. did not pass
   validation steps defined in Section X.Y).

   Optional text (if option foo in expected to be exchanged between
   relays and servers): Option foo is exchanged between relays and
   servers only.  Clients are not aware of the usage of option foo.
   Clients MUST ignore received option foo.

21.2.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior Text

   Sections 17.2.2 and 18.2 of [RFC3315] govern server operation in
   regards to option assignment.  As a convenience to the reader, we
   mention here that the server will send option foo only if configured
   with specific values for foo and the client requested it.

   Optional text: Option foo is a singleton.  Servers MUST NOT send more
   than one instance of foo option.

   Optional text (if server is never supposed to receive option foo):
   Servers MUST ignore incoming foo option.

21.3.  DHCPv6 Relay Agent Behavior Text

   It's never appropriate for a relay agent to add options to a message
   heading toward the client, and relay agents don't actually construct
   Relay-Reply messages anyway.

   Optional text (if foo option is exchanged between clients and server
   or between requestors and servers): There are no additional
   requirements for relays.

   Optional text (if relays are expected to insert or consume option
   foo): Relay agents MAY include option foo in a Relay-Forw when
   forwarding packets from clients to the servers.

22.  Should the new document update existing RFCs?

   Authors often ask themselves a question whether their proposal
   updates exist RFCs, especially 3315.  In April 2013 there were about
   80 options defined.  Had all documents that defined them also updated
   RFC3315, comprehension of such a document set would be extremely
   difficult.  It should be noted that "extends" and "updates" are two
   very different verbs.  If a new draft defines a new option that
   clients request and servers provide, it merely extends current



Hankins, et al.         Expires December 31, 2013              [Page 24]

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Option Guidelines               June 2013


   standards, so "updates 3315" is not required in the new document
   header.  On the other hand, if a new document replaces or modifies
   existing behavior, it should be noted that it updates the other
   document.  For example, [RFC6644] clearly updates [RFC3315] as it
   replaces existing with new text.

23.  Security Considerations

   DHCPv6 does have an Authentication mechanism ([RFC3315]) that makes
   it possible for DHCPv6 software to discriminate between authentic
   endpoints and man-in-the-middle.  Other authentication mechanisms may
   optionally be deployed.

   So, while creating a new option, it is prudent to assume that the
   DHCPv6 packet contents are always transmitted in the clear, and
   actual production use of the software will probably be vulnerable at
   least to man-in-the-middle attacks from within the network, even
   where the network itself is protected from external attacks by
   firewalls.  In particular, some DHCPv6 message exchanges are
   transmitted to multicast addresses that are likely broadcast anyway.

   If an option is of a specific fixed length, it is useful to remind
   the implementer of the option data's full length.  This is easily
   done by declaring the specific value of the 'length' tag of the
   option.  This helps to gently remind implementers to validate option
   length before digesting them into likewise fixed length regions of
   memory or stack.

   If an option may be of variable size (such as having indeterminate
   length fields, such as domain names or text strings), it is advisable
   to explicitly remind the implementor to be aware of the potential for
   long options.  Either define a reasonable upper limit (and suggest
   validating it), or explicitly remind the implementor that an option
   may be exceptionally long (to be prepared to handle errors rather
   than truncate values).

   For some option contents, out of bound values may be used to breach
   security.  An IP address field might be made to carry a loopback
   address, or local multicast address, and depending on the protocol
   this may lead to undesirable results.  A domain name field may be
   filled with contrived contents that exceed the limitations placed
   upon domain name formatting - as this value is possibly delivered to
   "internal configuration" records of the system, it may be implicitly
   trusted without being validated.

   Authors of drafts defining new DHCP options are therefore strongly
   advised to explicitly define validation measures that recipients of
   such options are required to do before processing such options.



Hankins, et al.         Expires December 31, 2013              [Page 25]

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Option Guidelines               June 2013


   However, validation measures already defined by RFC3315 or other
   specifications referenced by the new option document are redundant,
   and can introduce errors, so authors are equally strongly advised to
   refer to the base specification for any such validation language
   rather than copying it into the new specification.

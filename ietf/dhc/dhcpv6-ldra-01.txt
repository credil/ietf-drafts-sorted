Internet-Draft                    LDRA                      October 2009


Abstract

   This document proposes a Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent (LDRA) that
   is used to insert relay agent options in DHCPv6 message exchanges
   identifying client-facing interfaces.  The LDRA can be implemented in
   existing access nodes (such as DSLAMs and Ethernet switches) that do
   not support IPv6 control or routing functions.

Internet-Draft                    LDRA                      October 2009


1.  Introduction

   DHCPv6 Relay-Agents [RFC3315] are deployed to forward DHCPv6 messages
   between clients and servers when they are not on the same IPv6 link
   and are often implemented alongside a routing function in a common
   node.  A Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent (LDRA) allows Relay Agent
   Information to be inserted by an access node that performs a link-
   layer bridging (i.e. non-routing) function.  A LDRA resides on the
   same IPv6 link as the client and a DHCPv6 Relay Agent or Server and
   is functionally the equivalent of the Layer 2 DHCP Relay draft[L2RA]
   proposed for DHCPv4 operation.

   Unlike a DHCPv6 Relay-Agent specified in [RFC3315], a LDRA does not
   implement any IPv6 control functions (e.g.  ICMPv6) or have any
   routing capability in the node.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Background

   A variety of different link-layer network topologies exist for the
   aggregation of IPv6 nodes into one or more routers.  In Layer 2
   aggregation networks (IEEE 802.1D bridging or similar) that have many
   nodes on a single link, a DHCPv6 server or DHCP relay agent would
   normally be unaware of how a DHCP client is attached to the network.
   The LDRA allows Relay Agent Information, including the Interface-ID
   option [RFC3315], to be inserted by the access node so that it may be
   used by the DHCPv6 server for client identification.  A typical
   application in a broadband service provider may be as an equivalent
   to the Broadband Forum TR-101 Layer 2 DHCP Relay Agent[TR-101]
   described in [L2RA]


3.  Terminology

   Access Node               A device that combines many interfaces onto
                             one link.  An access node is not IP-aware
                             in the data path

   Address                   An IP layer identifier for an interface or
                             set of interfaces

Internet-Draft                    LDRA                      October 2009


   Client-facing             An interface on the access node that
                             carries traffic towards the DHCPv6 client

   Host                      A non-routing IPv6 node that is
                             participating in DHCPv6 message exchange

   LDRA                      Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent

   Lightweight Relay Agent   A function on the access node that
                             intercepts DHCP messages between clients
                             and servers.  The function exists as a bump
                             in the wire on the IP link.

   Link                      A communication facility or medium over
                             which nodes can communicate at the link
                             layer

   Link-local address        An IP address having only local-scope,
                             indicated by having the address prefix
                             FE80::/10, that can be used to reach
                             neighbouring nodes attached to the same
                             link.  Every interface has a link-local
                             address.

   Network-facing            An interface on the access node that
                             carries traffic towards the DHCPv6
                             server(s)

   Node                      A device that implements IPv6

                             addressed to itself

   Relay Agent               A node that acts as an intermediary to
                             deliver DHCP messages between clients and
                             servers and being on the same link as the
                             client

   Unspecified address       An IP address that is comprised entirely of
                             zeros


4.  Server Considerations

   This document updates the behavior specified in section 11 of DHCP
   for IPv6 [RFC3315].  RFC3315 states, in part:

Internet-Draft                    LDRA                      October 2009


   o  If the server receives the message from a forwarding relay agent,
      then the client is on the same link as the one to which the
      interface, identified by the link-address field in the message
      from the relay agent, is attached.

   DHCP server implementations conforming to this specification must,
   for the purposes of address selection, ignore any link-address field
   whose value is zero.  In the text from RFC3315 above, "link-address"
   refers both to the link-address field of the Relay-forward message,
   and also the link-address fields in any Relay-forward messages that
   may be nested within the Relay-forward message.


5.  Message Format

   The Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent (LDRA) exchanges DHCP messages
   between clients and servers using the message formats established in
   [RFC3315].

   To maintain interoperability with existing DHCP relays and servers
   the message format is unchanged from [RFC3315].  The LDRA implements
   the same message types as a normal DHCPv6 Relay Agent.  They are:

   o  Relay-Forward Messages

   o  Relay-Reply Messages

5.1.  Relay-Forward Message

   The Relay-Forward message is created by any DHCPv6 Relay Agent,
   including an LDRA, to forward messages between clients and servers or
   other relay agents.  These messages are built as specified in
   [RFC3315]

   The Relay-Forward message contains relay agent parameters that
   identify the client-facing interface on which any reply messages
   should be forwarded.  These parameters are link-address, peer-address
   and Interface-ID.  The link-address parameter MUST be set to the
   unspecified address.  The Interface-ID Relay Agent Option MUST be
   included in the Relay-Forward message.  The LDRA MAY insert
   additional relay agent options.

5.2.  Relay-Reply Message

   The Relay-Reply message is constructed by a DHCPv6 server to send
   parameters to a DHCP client when a relay agent is present between the
   server and the client.  The Relay-Reply message may be sent after an
   initial Relay-Forward message as the parameters link-address, peer-

Internet-Draft                    LDRA                      October 2009


   address, Interface-ID and the relay agent's IP address are learnt
   from the Relay-Forward message.

   The server MUST include the Interface-ID option in the Relay-Reply
   Message to indicate to the LDRA the interface on which the de-
   capsulated message should be forwarded.

5.3.  Mandatory DHCP Options

   Parameters are exchanged between DHCP client, relay-agent and server
   through the use of DHCP options.  There are a set of mandatory DHCP
   options that MUST be included by the LDRA in all Relay-Forward and
   Relay-Reply messages.  These are the:

   o  Relay-Message Option

   o  Interface-ID Option

5.3.1.  Relay-Message Option

   A DHCPv6 Relay Agent relays messages between clients and servers or
   other relay agents through Relay-Forward and Relay-Reply message
   types.  The original client DHCP message (i.e. the packet payload,
   excluding UDP and IP headers) is encapsulated in a Relay Message
   option [RFC3315].

   As an LDRA does not implement ICMPv6, fragmentation of Relay-Messages
   is not supported.  If a Relay-Message would exceed the MTU of the
   outgoing interface it MUST be discarded and an error condition SHOULD
   be logged.

5.3.2.  Interface-ID Option

   The LDRA MUST include the Interface-ID option [RFC3315] in all Relay-
   Forward messages.  When a LDRA receives a Relay-reply message with an
   Interface-ID option present and link-address unspecified, the LDRA
   MUST relay the decapsulated message to the client on the interface
   identified in the Interface-ID option.

   Servers MAY use the Interface-ID for parameter assignment policies.
   The format of the Interface-ID is outside the scope of this
   contribution.  The Interface-ID SHOULD be considered an opaque value,
   i.e. the server SHOULD NOT try to parse the contents of the
   Interface-ID option.  The LDRA SHOULD use the same Interface-ID value
   for a given interface, and this value SHOULD be retained across
   restarts.  This is because, if the Interface-ID changes, a server
   will not be able to use it reliably in parameter assignment policies.

Internet-Draft                    LDRA                      October 2009


6.  Agent Behaviour

   The LDRA MUST have each of its interfaces configured as either
   client-facing or network (DHCPv6 server) facing.  The LDRA uses the
   notion of client-facing and network-facing interfaces to process the
   DHCPv6 messages.

6.1.  Relaying a Client Message

   When a DHCPv6 message (defined in [RFC3315]) is received on any
   client-facing interface, the LDRA MUST intercept and process the
   message.  The LDRA MUST also prevent the original message from being
   forwarded on the network facing interface.

   The lightweight relay agent adds any other options it is configured
   or required to include in the Relay-Forward message.  The LDRA MUST
   set the link-address field of the Relay-forward message to the
   Unspecified Address (::) and MUST include the Interface-ID option in
   all DHCP Relay-Forward messages.

   If the message received on the client-facing interface is a Relay-
   Forward message, the LDRA MUST set the Hop-Count field in the newly
   created Relay-Forward message to the value of the hop-count field in
   the received message incremented by 1 as specified in [RFC3315].

   The LDRA MUST copy the IP destination and link-layer destination
   addresses from the client-originated message into the IP destination
   address and link-layer destination address of the Relay-forward
   message.

   The LDRA MUST copy the IP source address from the client-originated
   message into the peer-address field of the Relay-forward message.
   The LDRA MUST copy the link-layer source address from the client-
   originated message into the link-layer source address of the Relay-
   forward message.

6.1.1.  Client Message Validation

   On receipt of a DHCP message on the client facing interface, the LDRA
   MUST discard a message if it is of one of following message types:

   o  ADVERTISE (2)

   o  REPLY (7)

   o  RECONFIGURE (10)

Internet-Draft                    LDRA                      October 2009


   o  RELAY-REPLY (13)

   Options contained in the DHCPv6 message MUST NOT be validated by the
   LDRA, making it the responsibility of the DHCP server to check
   message option validity and allow new options to be introduced
   without changes on the LDRA.

6.1.2.  Trusted and Untrusted Interfaces

   In [RFC3046] DHCPv4 relay-agents had their client-facing interfaces
   set to trusted and untrusted.  An LDRA MUST implement a configuration
   setting for all client-facing interfaces, marking them either as
   trusted or as untrusted.  This setting SHOULD be configurable per
   interface.  When a client-facing interface is deemed untrusted the
   LDRA MUST discard any message received from the client-facing
   interface of type RELAY-FORWARD (12).

   In DHCPv4 it was not possible for a DHCP server to determine whether
   the client or an intermediate relay agent had added relay agent
   options and thus trusted interfaces (relay-agent interfaces that
   would allow any DHCP options to be present on incoming messages) and
   untrusted interfaces (relay-agent interfaces that would ensure there
   are no relay-agent options on incoming messages) were defined.  In
   DHCPv6, relay agents encapsulate the received message into the Relay-
   Message Option in addition to adding any relay-agent options.  This
   nested message behaviour allows a server to identify the options each
   relay-agent has inserted along the path, whenever the data path
   between LDRA and server falls within a protected or operator
   controlled environment.

   When an LDRA is deployed, DHCPv6 servers MAY be configured with the
   Relay-Forward hop-count of the LDRA to instruct at which level of
   nesting the relay-agent options should be parsed.  This removes the
   need for an interface to be configured as trusted or untrusted by
   providing the DHCPv6 server with an awareness of the LDRA logical
   location in the DHCP relay path.  This behaviour is dependent on the
   interception of all DHCP messages by the LDRA and the incrementing of
   the Relay-Forward hop-count if a Relay-Forward message is received
   from the client-facing LDRA interface.

6.2.  Relaying a Relay-Reply message from the network

   The LDRA MUST intercept and process all IP traffic received on the
   network-facing interface that has:

   o  a link-local scoped source address;





Miles, et al.            Expires April 16, 2010                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                    LDRA                      October 2009


   o  a link-local scoped destination address;

   o  protocol type UDP; and

   o  destination port 547

   An LDRA MUST inspect the DHCP message type and MUST silently discard
   any DHCP message that is not type Relay-Reply or is otherwise an
   invalid DHCPv6 packet.  The LDRA SHOULD ignore any message that does
   not meet this criteria and subject it to normal packet forwarding.

   In addition to the validity checks performed by a relay agent in
   [RFC3315] , the Relay-Reply message is considered valid by the LDRA
   if:

   - The Interface-ID Option is present and the value corresponds to a
   valid interface in the access node,

   - the Relay-Reply peer-address and the destination IP address MUST be
   identical and MUST be a link-local scoped address when no IP address
   is configured on the LDRA, and

   - the link-address is the Unspecified Address when no IP address is
   configured on the LDRA

   The LDRA copies the peer-address into to the destination IP address
   field.  The LDRA SHOULD forward the packet to the correct client-
   facing interface using the destination link-layer (MAC) address or
   the Interface-Id in the Relay-Reply.  The LDRA SHOULD NOT retransmit
   the packet on any other interface.  The contents of the Relay Message
   Option is put into an IP/UDP packet and then forwarded to the client.

   The LDRA MUST copy the link-layer and IP source address from the
   Relay-Reply message into the IP/UDP packet that is forwarded to the
   client.


7.  Network Topology

   The LDRA intercepts any DHCPv6 message received on client-facing
   interfaces with a destination IP address of
   All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers (FF02::1:2).  The LDRA MUST NOT
   forward the original client message to a network-facing interface, it
   MUST process the message and add the appropriate Relay-Forward
   options as described in previous sections.

7.1.  Client and Server on Same Link

   The access node acts as a bridge; it has no information about any IP
   prefixes that are valid on the link, thus a server should consider
   address and parameter assignment as if the client DHCP message was
   not relayed.

   For example, if a client sent a DHCP solicit message that was relayed
   by the LDRA and then to the server, the server would receive the
   following Relay-Forward message from the LDRA:

   src-ip:              client link-local address
   dst-ip:              All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers
     msg-type:          RELAY-FORWARD
     hop-count:         0
     link-address:      Unspecified_Address
     peer-address:      client link-local address
     Interface-ID Option:
       interface-id:    LDRA-inserted interface-id
     Relay-Message Option, which contains:
       msg-type:        SOLICIT
       Solicit Message Options: <from client>

7.2.  Client and Server behind Relay Agent

   The client and server are on different IPv6 links, separated by one
   or more relay agents that will typically act as a router.  The LDRA
   will send Relay-Forward messages upstream towards the second relay
   agent which in turn will process the messages.

   For example, if a client sent a DHCP solicit message that was relayed
   by the LDRA to another relay agent and then to the server, the server
   would receive the following Relay-Forward message from the LDRA:

   src-ip:              relayB

         Solicit Message Options: <from client>

7.3.  Relay Agent in Front of LDRA

   The client and server are on different IPv6 links, separated by one
   or more relay agents that will typically act as a router and there is
   an [RFC3315] Relay Agent on the client-facing Interface of the LDRA.
   The LDRA will send Relay-Forward messages upstream towards the second
   relay agent which in turn will process the messages.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new namespaces for the IANA to
   manage.


10.  Security Considerations

   Although the LDRA only listens to client-originated IPv6 traffic sent
   to the All_DHCPv6_Servers_and_Relay_Agents address on UDP port 547,
   the LDRA SHOULD implement some form of rate-limiting on received
   messages to prevent excessive process utilisation.  As DHCP is
   session-oriented, messages in excess of the rate-limit may be
   silently discarded.

   The hop count based determination of the trustworthiness of the LDRA
   can be easily defeated by a rogue relay agent on the network-facing
   interface of the LDRA.

    <abstract>
      <t>The DHCPv6 protocol, defined in <xref target="RFC3315"/> allows
      for multiple servers to operate on a single network, however it does
      not define any way the servers could share information about currently
      active clients and their leases. Some sites are interested in running multiple
      servers in such a way as to provide increased availability in case of server
      failure. In order for this to work reliably, the cooperating
      primary and secondary servers must maintain a consistent
      database of the lease information. <xref target="RFC3315"/> allows for
      but does not define any redundancy or failover mechanisms. This document
      outlines requirements for DHCPv6 failover, enumerates related
      problems, and discusses the proposed scope of work to be
      conducted. This document does not define a DHCPv6 failover
      protocol.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The DHCPv6 protocol, defined in <xref target="RFC3315"/>
      allows for multiple servers to be operating on a single network,
      however it does not define how the servers can share the same
      address and prefix delegation pools and allow a client to
      seamlessly extend its existing leases when the original server
      is down. <xref target="RFC3315"/> provides for these
      capabilities, but does not document how the servers cooperate
      and communicate to provide this capability. Some sites are
      interested in running multiple servers in such a way as to
      provide redundancy in case of server failure. In order for this
      to work reliably, the cooperating primary and secondary servers
      must maintain a consistent database of the lease
      information.</t>

      <t>This document discusses failover implementations scenarios,
      failure modes, and synchronization approaches to provide background
      to the list of requirements for a DHCPv6 failover protocol.
      It then defines a minimum set of requirements that
      failover must provide to be useful, while acknowledging that
      additional features may be specified as extensions. This
      document does not define a DHCPv6 failover protocol.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Definitions">
      <t>This section defines terms that are relevant to DHCPv6 failover.</t>
      <t>Definitions from <xref target="RFC3315"/> are included by reference. In
      particular, client means any device (e.g., end user host, CPE or
      other router) that implements client functionality of the DHCPv6
      protocol. A server means a DHCPv6 server, unless explicitly noted
      otherwise. A relay is a DHCPv6 relay.</t>
      <t><list>
        <t>A binding (or client binding) is a group of server data
        records containing the information the server has about the
        addresses in an IA or configuration information explicitly
        assigned to the client.  Configuration information that has
        been returned to a client through a policy - for example, the
        information returned to all clients on the same link - does
        not require a binding.</t>
        <t>DDNS - an abbreviation for "Dynamic DNS", which refers to
        the capability to update a DNS server's name database using the
        on-the-wire protocol defined in <xref
        target="RFC2136"/>. Clients and servers can negotiate the scope of
        such updates as defined in <xref target="RFC4704"/>.</t>
        <t>Failover - an ability of one partner to continue offering
        services provided by another partner, with minimal or no
        impact on clients.</t>
        <t>FQDN - a fully qualified domain
        name. A fully qualified domain name generally is a host name
        with at least one zone name. For example "dhcp.example.org" is
        a fully qualified domain name.</t>
        <t>High Availability - a desired
        property of DHCPv6 servers to continue providing services
        despite experiencing unwanted events such as server crashes, link
        failures, or network partitions.</t>
        <t>Load Balancing - the ability for two or more servers
        to each process some portion of the client request traffic in
        a conflict-free fashion.</t>
        <t>Lease - an IPv6 address, an IPv6 prefix or other resource
        that was assigned ("leased") by a server to a specific
        client. A lease may include additional information, like
        associated fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and/or
        information about associated DNS updates.</t>
        <t>Partner - A
        "partner", for the purpose of this document, refers to a
        failover server, typically the other failover server in a failover
        relationship. </t>
        <t>Stable Storage - each DHCP server is required to keep its
        lease database in some form of storage (known as "stable storage") that
        will be consistent throughout reboots, crashes and power failures.</t>
        <t>Partner Failure - A power outage, unexpected shutdown,
        crash or other type of failure that renders a partner unable
        to continue its operation.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Scope of work">
      <t> In order to fit within the IETF process effectively and
      efficiently, the standardization effort for DHCPv6 failover is
      expected to proceed with the creation of documents of increasing
      specificity.  It begins with this document specifying the
      requirements for DHCPv6 failover ("requirements document").
      Later documents are expected to address the design of the DHCPv6
      failover protocol ("design document"), and if sufficient
      interest exists, the protocol details required to implement the
      DHCPv6 failover protocol itself ("protocol document").  The goal
      of this partitioning is, in part, to ease the validation,
      review, and approval of the DHCPv6 failover protocol by
      presenting it in comprehensible parts to the larger
      community.</t>

      <t>Additional documents describing extensions may also be
      defined.</t>

      <t>DHCPv6 Failover requirements are presented in <xref
      target="requirements"/>.</t>

      <section anchor="alternatives" title="Alternatives to Failover">
        <t>There are many scenarios when it seems that a failover capability
        would be useful. However, there are often much simpler approaches
        that will meet the required goals. This section documents examples
        where failover is not really needed.</t>
        <section title="Short-lived addresses">
          <t>There are cases when IPv6 addresses are used only for a
          short time, but there is a need to have high degree of
          confidence that those addresses will be served. A notable
          example is a PXE scenario where hosts require an address during
          boot. Address and possibly other configuration parameters
          are used during boot process and are discarded
          afterwards. Any lack of available DHCPv6 service at this
          time may render the devices unbootable.</t>
          <t>Instead of deploying failover, it is better to use the
          much simpler preference mechanism, defined in <xref
          target="RFC3315"/>. For example, consider two or more
          servers with each having distinct preference set (e.g. 10
          and 20). Both will answer to a client's request. The client
          should choose the one with larger preference value. In case
          of failure of the most preferred server, the next server
          will keep responding to clients' queries. This approach is
          simple to deploy, but does not offer lease stability, i.e.
          in case of server failure, clients' addresses and prefixes
          will change.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Redundant servers">
          <t>In some cases the desire to deploy failover is motivated by
          high availability, i.e. to continue providing services
          despite server failure. If there are no additional
          requirements, that goal may be fulfilled with simply
          deploying two or more independent servers on the same link.</t>

          <t>There are several well documented approaches how such
          deployment works. They are discussed in detail in <xref
          target="RFC6853"/>. Each of
          those approaches is simpler to deploy and maintain than full
          failover.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Distributed databases">
          <t>Some servers may allow their lease database to be stored
          in external databases. Another possible alternative to
          failover is to configure two servers to connect to the same
          distributed database.</t>

          <t>Care should be taken to understand how inconsistencies
          are solved in such database backends and how such conflict
          resolutions affect DHCPv6 server operation.</t>

          <t>It is also essential to use only databases that are
          really distributed and do not have single point of failure
          themselves. Otherwise the single point of failure is
          only moved to a different location (database rather than
          DHCPv6 server). Such a configuation does not improve
          redundancy, but significantly complicates deployment.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Load Balancing">
          <t>Sometimes the desire to deploy more than one server
          is based on the assumption that they will will share the
          client traffic. Administrators that are interested in
          such a capability are advised to deploy a load balancing
          mechanism, defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-load-balancing"/>.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Failover Scenarios">
      <t>The following section provides several examples of deployment
      scenarios and use cases that may be associated with capabilities
      commonly referred to as failover. These scenarios may be inside
      or outside of scope for DHCPv6 failover protocol as defined by
      this document. They are
      enumerated here to provide a common basis for discussion.</t>
      <section title="Hot Standby Model">
        <t>In the simplest case, there are two partners that are connected
        to the same network. Only one of partners ("primary") provides
        services to clients. In case of its failure, the second partner
        ("secondary") continues handling services previously handled
        by first partner. As both servers are connected to the same
        network, a partner that fails to communicate with its partner
        while also receiving requests from clients may assume with
        high probability that its partner is down and the network is
        functional. This assumption may affect its operation.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="geo" title="Geographically Distributed Failover">
        <t>Servers may be physically located in separate locations. A
        common example of such a topology is where a service provider
        has at least a regional high performance network between
        geographically distributed datacenters.
        In such a scenario, one server is
        located in one datacenter and its failover partner is located
        in another remote datacenter.
        In this scenario, when one partner finds that it cannot communicate
        with the other partner, it does not necessarily mean that the other
        partner is down.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="lb" title="Load balancing">
        <t>A desire to have more than one server in a network may also
        be created by the desire to have incoming traffic be handled by
        several servers. This decreases the load each server must
        endure when all servers are operational. Although such a capability
        does not, strictly, require failover - it is clear that failover
        makes such an architecture more straightforward.
        </t>
        <t>Note that in a load balancing situation which includes
        failover, each individual server MUST be able to handle the
        full load normally handled by both servers working together,
        or there is not a true increase in availability.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="onetoone" title="1-to-1, m-to-1 and m-to-m models">
        <t>A failover relationship for a specific network is provided
        by two failover partners. Those partners communicate with each
        other and back up all pools. This scenario is sometimes
        referred to as the 1-to-1 model and is considered relatively
        simple. In larger networks one server may be participating in
        several failover relationships, i.e. it provides failover for
        several address or prefix pools, each served by separate
        partners. Such a scenario can be referred to as m-to-1. The
        most complex scenario - m-to-m - assumes that each partner
        participates in multiple failover relationships.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Split prefixes">
        <t>Due to the extensive IPv6 address space, it is possible to
        provide semi-redundant service by splitting the available pool
        of addressees into two or more non-overlapping pools, with
        each server handling its own smaller pool. Several versions of
        such a scenario are discussed in <xref
        target="RFC6853"/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Long lived connections">
        <t>Certain nodes may maintain long lived connections. Since
        the IPv6 address space is large, techniques exist (e.g.
        <xref target="RFC6853"/>)
        that use the easy availability of IPv6 addresses in order to
        provide increased DHCPv6 availability.  However, these
        approaches do not generally provide for stable IPv6 addresses
        for DHCPv6 clients should the server with which the client is
        interacting become unavailable.</t>
        <t>The obvious benefit of stable addresses is the ability to update
        DNS infrequently. While the DNS can be updated every time IPv6
        address changes, it introduces delays and (depending on DNS configuration)
        old entries may be cached for prolonged periods of time.</t>
        <t>The other benefit of having stable address is that many
        monitoring solutions provide statistics on a per IP basis, so
        IP changes make measuring characteristics of a given box more difficut.</t>

        <t>It should be noted that lease stability is an explicit
        non-goal in some deployments. One notable example is an ISP
        who wants to provide addresses that change frequently to
        prevent his customers from running servers (without paying
        extra for more enterprise oriented service).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Partial server communication loss">
        <!-- by Prasad: http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/dhcwg/current/msg12104.html -->
        <t>There is a scenario where the DHCPv6 server may be
        configured to serve clients on one network adapter and
        communicate with a partner server (server to server traffic) on a
        different network adapter. In this scenario, if the server
        loses connectivity on the network adapter used to communicate
        with the clients because of network adapter (hardware)
        failure, there is no intimation of the loss of service to the
        partner in the DHCPv6 failover protocol. Since the servers are
        able to communicate with each other, the partner remains
        ignorant of the loss of service to clients.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Principles of DHCPv6 Failover">
      <t>This section describes important issues that will affect any
      DHCPv6 failover protocol.
      This section is not intended to define implementation
      details, but rather high level concepts and issues that are
      important to DHCPv6 failover.
      These issues form a basis for later documents which deal
      with the solutions to these issues.</t>

      <section anchor="failures" title="Failure modes">
        <t>This section documents failure modes.  Each failure mode
        is listed as either an in-scope or out-of-scope requirement for
        the failover protocol.</t>
        <section anchor="partner-down" title="Server Failure">
          <t>Servers may become unresponsive due to a software crash,
          hardware failure, power outage or any number of other
          reasons. The failover partner will detect such event due to lack of
          responses from the down partner. In this failure mode, the
          assumption is that the server is the only equipment that is
          off-line and all other network equipment is operating
          normally. In particular, communication between other nodes
          is not interrupted.</t>
          <t>When working under the assumption that this is the only
          type of failure that can happen, the server may safely assume
          that its partner unreachability means that it is down, so
          other nodes (clients in particular) are not able to reach it
          either and no services are provided.</t>
          <t>It should be noted that recovery after the failed server
          is brought back on-line is straightforward, due to the fact that
          it just needs to download current information from the lease database
          of the healthy partner and there is no conflict resolution
          required.</t>
          <t>This is by far the most common failure mode between two
          failover partners.</t>
          <t>When the two servers are located physically close to each
          other, possibly in the same room, the probability that a failure
          to communicate between failover partners is due to server failure
          is increased.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="partition" title="Network partition">
          <t>Another possible cause of partner unreachability is
          a failure in the network that connects the two servers.
          This may be caused by failure of any kind
          of network equipment: router, switch,  physical cables, or
          optic fibers. As a result of such a failure the network is split into
          two or more disjoint sections (partitions) that are not able to
          communicate with each other. Such an event is called network
          partition. If failover partners are located in different
          partitions, they won't be able to communicate with each
          other. Nevertheless, each partner may still be able to serve
          clients that happen to be part of the same partition.</t>
          <t>If this failure mode is taken into consideration, a server
          can't assume that partner unreachability automatically means
          that its partner is down. They must consider the fact that
          the partner may continue operating and interacting with a subset
          of the clients. The only valid assumption is that
          partner also detected the network partition event and follows
          procedures specified for such a situation.</t>
          <t>It should be noted that recovery after a partitioned network
          is rejoined is significantly more complicated than
          recovery from a server failure event. As both servers may have kept
          serving clients, they have two separate lease databases, and
          they need to agree on the state of each lease (or follow any
          other algorithm to bring their lease databases into agreement).</t>
          <t>This failure mode is more likely (though still rare) in the
          situation where two servers are in physically distant locations
          with multiple network elements between them.
          This is the case in geographically distributed
          failover (see <xref target="geo"/>).</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sync" title="Synchronization mechanisms">
        <t>Partners must exchange information about changes made to the
        lease database. There are at least two types of sychronization
        methods that may be used. These concepts are related to distributed
        databases, so some familiarity with distributed database
        is useful to better understand this topic.</t>
        <section anchor="lockstep" title="Lockstep">
          <t>When a server receives a REQUEST message from a client it
          consults its lease database and assigns requested
          addresses and/or prefixes. To make sure that its partner
          maintains a consistent database, it then sends information
          about a new or just updated lease to the partner and waits for
          the partner's response. After the response from partner is
          received the REPLY message is transmitted to the client.</t>
          <t>This approach has the benefit of having a completely consistent
          lease database between partners at all times.
          Unfortunately, there is a large performance penalty for
          this approach as each response sent to a client is delayed
          by the total sum of the delays caused by two
          transmissions between partners and the processing by the second
          partner. The second partner is expected to update its own
          copy of the lease database in permanent storage, so this delay
          is not negligible, even in fast networks.</t>
          <t>Due to advent of SSD disks or battery backed ram disks
          technology, this write performance penalty can be limited to
          some degree.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="lazy-updates" title="Lazy updates">
          <t>Another approach to synchronizing the lease databases is to
          transmit the REPLY message to the client before completing the
          update to the partner.
          The server sends the REPLY to the client immediately after
          assigning appropriate addresses and/or prefixes and
          initiates the partner update at a later time, depending on the
          algorithm chosen. Another varation of this approach is to initiate
          transmission to the partner, but not wait for its response
          before sending the REPLY to the client.</t>
          <t>This approach has benefit of a minimal impact on server
          response times, thus it is much better from a performance
          perspective. However, it makes the lease databases
          loosely synchronized between partners. This makes the
          synchronization more complex (and particularly the re-integration
          after a network partition event), as there may be cases where one
          client has been given a lease on an address or prefix of which the
          partner is not aware (e.g. if server crashes after sending REPLY to the client,
          but before sending update information to its partner).</t>

    <section title="DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 Failover Comparison">
      <t>There are significant similarities between existing DHCPv4
      and envisaged DHCPv6 failovers. In particular both serve IP
      addresses to clients, require maintaining consistent databases
      among partners, need to perform consistent DNS Updates, must
      be able take over bindings offered by failed partner, must
      be able to resume operation after partner is recovered. DNS
      conflict resolution works on the same principles in both
      DHCPv4 and DHCPv6.</t>

      <t>Nevertheless, there are significant
      differences. IPv6 introduced prefix delegation <xref
      target="RFC3633"/> that is a crucial element of the DHCPv6
      protocol. IPv6 also introduced the concept of deprecated
      addresses with separate prefered and valid lifetimes, both
      being configured via DHCPv6. Negative response (NACK) in DHCPv4 has
      been replaced with the ability in DHCPv6 to provide corrected
      response in a REPLY message that differs from a REQUEST.</t>

      <t>Also, the typical large address space (close to 2^64
      addresses on /64 prefixes expected to be available on most
      networks) may make managing address assignment significantly
      different from DHCPv4 failover. In DHCPv4 it was not possible to
      use a hash or calculated technique to divide the significantly
      more limited address space and therefore much of the protocol
      that deals with pool balancing and rebalancing might not be
      necessary and can be done mathematically. And, it may also be
      possible and reasonable to use a much longer MCLT (see
      <xref target="mclt"/>) value -- as
      reusing an address for a different client is generally not a
      requirement (at least over the near term) as close to 2^64
      addresses may be available.</t>

      <t>However, DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation is similar to IPv4
      addressing regarding number of available leases and therefore
      techniques for pool balancing and rebalancing and shorter MCLT
      times will be needed.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="requirements" title="DHCPv6 Failover Requirements">
      <t>This section summarizes the requirements for DHCPv6 failover.</t>

      <t>Certain capabilities may be useful in some, but not all
      scenarios. Such additional features will be considered
      optional parts of failover, and will be split and defined in
      separate documents. As such, this document can be considered an
      attempt to define requirements for the DHCPv6 failover "core"
      protocol.</t>

      <t>The core of the DHCPv6 failover protocol is expected to
      provide the following properties:</t>
      <t>
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>The number of supported partners MUST be exactly two,
        i.e. there are at most two servers that are aware of a
        specific lease.</t>

        <t>For each prefix or address pool, a server MUST NOT
        participate in more than one failover relationship.</t>

        <t>The defined protocol MUST support the m-to-1 model (i.e. one server
        may form more than one relationship), but an implementation
        MAY choose to implement only the 1-to-1 model (i.e. everything
        from one server is backed on another).</t>

        <!--
        <t>Server MAY participate in multiple relationships only if
        those relationships cover different prefix or address
        pools.</t>-->

        <t>One partner MUST be able to continue serving leases offered
        by the other partner. This property is also sometimes called
        "lease stability".  The failure of either failover partner
        SHOULD pose minimal or no impact on client connectivity. In
        particular, it MUST NOT force the client to change addresses
        and/or change prefixes delegated to it.  Long-lived
        connections MUST NOT be disturbed.</t>

        <t>Prefix delegation MUST be supported.</t>

        <t>Use of the failover protocol MUST NOT introduce significant
        performance impact on server response times. Therefore
        synchronization between partners MUST be done using some form
        of lazy updates (see <xref target="lazy-updates"/>).</t>

        <t>The pair of failover servers MUST be able to recover from
        a server down failure (see <xref target="partner-down"/>).</t>

        <t>The pair of failover servers MUST be able to recover from a
        network partition event (see <xref target="partition"/>).</t>

        <t>The design MUST allow secure communication between the failover
        partners.</t>

        <t>The definition of extensions to this core protocol SHOULD
        be allowed, when possible.</t>

      </list>
      Depending on the specific nature of the failure, the recovery procedures
      mentioned in points 7 and 8 may require manual intervention.
      </t>

      <t>High Availability is a property of the protocol that allows
      clients to receive DHCPv6 services despite the failure of
      individual DHCPv6 servers. In particular, it means the server
      that takes over providing service to clients from its failed
      partner, will continue serving the same addresses and/or
      prefixes. This property is also called "lease stability".</t>

      <t>Despite the lack of standardization of DHCPv4 failover, the
      coexistence of DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 failover MAY be taken into
      consideration. In particular, certain features that are common
      for both IPv4 and IPv6, like DNS Update mechanism SHOULD
      be taken into consideration.</t>

      <section anchor="out-of-scope" title="Features out of scope">
        <t>The following features are explictly out of scope.
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Load Balancing - a capability is considered an extension
          and MAY be defined in a separate document. It MUST NOT be
          part of the core protocol, but rather defined as an
          extension. The primary reason for this the desire to limit
          core protocol complexity. Load Balancing is likely to
          be defined as an extension.
          See <xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-load-balancing"/>.</t>

          <t>Configuration synchronization - two failover partners are
          expected to maintain the same configuration. Mismatched
          configuration between partners is a frequent problem in
          failover solutions. Unfortunately, that is an open-ended
          problem, since different servers have very different config
          data models.</t>

        <section anchor="mclt" title="Goals lead to Concepts">
          <t>The goal to have a minimal performance impact on the operation
          of the DHCPv4 servers participating in failover is the
          driving force behind the design of the DHCPv4 failover protocol.</t>

          <t>The steps in this chain of reasoning are as follows:</t>

          <t><list style="numbers">

            <t>To avoid the major performance impact that a lockstep update of
            a failover partner would inflict, use a lazy update approach
            (see <xref target="lazy-updates"/>).</t>

            <t>When using lazy update, there is always the problem that the
            failover server could crash after it has responded to some number
            of DHCPv4 clients and before it has updated its partner with the
            lease information it provided to those clients.</t>

            <t>Thus, when one failover server cannot communicate with another
            failover server, it cannot know what that other failover server has
            told any of its DHCPv4 clients.</t>

          </list></t>

          <t>This creates an obvious problem.</t>

          <t>The central concept in the DHCPv4 failover design is
          to place a limit on the uncertainty described in point
          #3, above.  The DHCPv4 failover protocol is designed to
          ensure that every failover server knows at all times, not
          exactly what its failover partner has told to the DHCPv4
          clients with which it is communicating, but rather the
          limits of what its failover partner could have told any
          DHCPv4 clients with which it was communicating.</t>

          <t>This is done by ensuring that no DHCPv4 server
          participating in a failover relationship will ever offer
          a lease time to any DHCPv4 client that is more than an
          agreed-upon value beyond that known by its failover
          partner.</t>

          <t>This agreed-upon value is called the "Maximum Client
          Lead Time", and abbreviated MCLT.</t>

          <t>Thus, every DHCPv4 failover partner needs to know what
          its partner knows about every lease in the server, and
          it needs to ensure that it will never provide a lease
          time to any DHCPv4 client that is beyond what its partner
          believes the current lease time to be plus the MCLT.</t>

          <t>Given this fundamental guarantee, if one failover
          server cannot communicate with its failover partner, then
          it knows the limits of what any DHCPv4 client of that
          missing partner might have for a lease time.  If this
          failover server  waits until it believes a lease has
          expired and then also waits until the MCLT has passed,
          it knows that the lease is sure to have expired (or the
          DHCPv4 client will have tried to renew the lease and
          communicated with the remaining DHCPv4 server).  (We will
          deal with network partition events below.)</t>

          <t>In order to allow a remaining failover server to provide
          service to newly arrived DHCPv4 clients, while waiting
          out the MCLT beyond the lease expiration (if any), the
          protocol provides for allocation of some percentage of
          the available leases to each failover partner.</t>

          <t>A failover server which cannot communicate with its
          partner must therefore wait out the MCLT beyond the lease
          expiration (if any) of IP addresses before it can allocate
          them to DHCPv4 clients.  This could impact the server's
          ability to provide available IP addresses to newly arrived
          DHCPv4 clients.  To prevent this impact the DHCPv4 failover
          protocol divides the allocation of the available leases
          between each failover partner.  The protocol supports
          periodic rebalancing of the allocation of these available
          leases.</t>

        </section>
        <section title="Use of the MCLT in practice">

          <t>From the above discussion, it should be clear how to
          avoid re-using an IP address before it has expired.  The
          MCLT is central to the operation of the protocol.  One
          server cannot offer a lease to a DHCPv4 client that is
          more than the MCLT beyond the current lease time for this
          client that is known by the failover partner.  From this
          standpoint, it would be good for the MCLT to be as long
          as possible.  However, in a failure situation, waiting
          the MCLT beyond the current lease time in order to reuse
          a leased lease would suggest that the MCLT should be as
          short as possible.</t>

          <t>This tension is resolved by anticipating the need to
          extend lease times when communicating with the failover
          partner.  The first lease offered to a DHCPv4 client can
          be only as long as the MCLT.  However, when the failover
          server updates its partner, it updates the partner with
          the desired lease time plus the 1/2 of MCLT (assuming the
          T1 time is 50% of the lease time.  Thus, when the
          client returns with a renewal request at halfway through
          the MCLT, the failover server can extend its lease for
          only the lease time known by the partner plus the MCLT.
          But the partner now knows the desired lease time, so that
          the server can extend the lease for as long as it was
          configured since it had pre-updated the failover partner
          with this time.</t>

          <t>Using this approach, one can keep the MCLT relatively
          short, say 1 hour, and still offer leases of any desired
          extent to clients -- once the failover partner has been
          updated with the desired lease time.</t>


        </section>
        <section title="Network Partition Events">

          <t>It is clear that when one failover server finds that
          it is unable to communicate with its failover partner,
          it is impossible for that server to tell if its failover
          partner is down or if the communication path to that
          failover partner is broken, a situation known as "network
          partition" (see <xref target="partition"/>). The DHCPv4
          failover protocol distinguishes between these different
          situations by having different failover states to represent
          "communications-interrupted" situations and "partner-down"
          situations. The expectation is that (at least in some
          situations) it requires an operator action to distinguish
          between a communications-interrupted and partner-down
          event.  In particular, the DHCPv4 failover protocol does
          not conflate these two situations.</t>

          <t>Correct handling of network partition events requires
          that a failover server unable to communicate with its
          failover partner (but not yet informed that its failover
          partner is down), must not re-allocate an IP address from
          one DHCPv4 client to another.  Available addresses may
          be allocated to any DHCPv4 client.</t>

          <t>After a failover server has been informed that its
          partner is down, it can reallocate an IP address from one
          DHCPv4 client to another once it has waited the MCLT
          beyond the lease expiration of that IP address.  This
          need to be informed by an external entity that the failover
          partner is down is the only impact of correctly handling
          network partition events.  Of course, specific implementations
          can assume that an unreachable failover partner is down
          after a shorter or longer time, thus limiting the support
          for a network partition event.  </t>

        </section>
        <section title="Conflict Resolution">

          <t>Whenever one failover server receives an update from
          its failover partner, it needs to decide if the update
          it has received is "better" than the information it has
          in its own database concerning the DHCPv4 client or the
          lease on the IPv4 address.  The DHCPv4 failover protocol
          does not mandate the details of this decision, but this
          activity must be part of any DHCPv4 implementation.  In
          most cases, comparing the times associated with the
          failover update with the times held in the server's own
          database will allow this decision to be made.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Load Balancing">

          <t>The DHCPv4 Load Balancing protocol <xref target="RFC3074"/>
          integrates with the DHCPv4 failover protocol by defining
          the way that each server decides which DHCPv4 clients to
          process.  Use of load balancing with the DHCPv4 failover
          protocol is an optional extension to the failover protocol.
          Both a simple active -- passive relationship without
          load balancing is defined as well as a more complex active
          -- active relationship.</t>

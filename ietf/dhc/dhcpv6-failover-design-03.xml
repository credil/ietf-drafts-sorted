    <abstract>
      <t>DHCPv6 defined in <xref target="RFC3315"/> does not offer
      server redundancy. This document defines a design for DHCPv6
      failover, a mechanism for running two servers on the same
      network with capability for either server to take over clients'
      leases in case of server failure or network partition.  This is
      a DHCPv6 Failover design document, it is not protocol
      specification document. It is a second document in a planned
      series of three documents. DHCPv6 failover requirements are
      specified in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-failover-requirements"/>.  A
      protocol specification document is planned to follow this
      document.</t>

      <list style="symbols">

        <t>auto-partner-down - a capability where a failover server
	will move from COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED state to 
	PARTNER-DOWN state automatically, without operator intervention.</t>

	<t>Failover endpoint - The failover protocol allows for
	there to be a unique failover 'endpoint' for each failover
	relationship in which a failover server participates.  The
	failover relationship is defined by a relationship name,
	and includes the failover partner IP address, the role this
	server takes with respect to that partner (primary or
	secondary), and the prefixes associated with that relationship.
	Note that a single prefix can only be associated with a
	single failover relationship.  This failover endpoint can
	take actions and hold unique states.  Typically, there is
	one failover endpoint per partner (server), although there
	may be more.  'Server' and 'failover endpoint' are synonymous
	only if the server participates in only one failover
	relationship. However, for the sake of simplicity 'Server'
	is used throughout the document to refer to a failover
	endpoint unless to do so would be confusing.</t>

        <t>Failover communication - all messages exchanged between
        partners.</t>

        <t>Independent Allocation - an allocation algorithm
        that splits the available pool of resources between the primary
        and secondary servers that is particularly well suited for
        vast pools (i.e. when available resources are not expected
        to deplete). See <xref target="alloc-separated"/> for
        details.</t>

        <t>Partner - name of the other DHCPv6 server that participates
        in failover relationship. When the role (primary or secondary)
        is not important, the other server is referred to as a "failover
        partner" or simply partner.</t>

        <t>Primary Server - First out of two DHCPv6 servers that participate
        in a failover relationship. In active-passive mode this is the
        server that handles most of the client traffic. Its failover partner
        is referred to as secondary server. </t>

        <t>Proportional Allocation - an allocation algorithm
        that splits the available resources (addresses or prefixes) between
        the primary and secondary servers and maintains proportions between
	available resources on both. It is particularly well suited for more
        limited resources.  See <xref target="alloc-classic"/> for
        details.</t>

	<t>Resource - Any type of resource that is managed by
	DHCPv6. Currently there are two types of such resources
	defined: a non-temporary IPv6 address and an IPv6 prefix.
	Due to the nature of temporary addresses, they are not
	covered by the failover mechanism. Other resource types may
	be defined in the future.</t>

        <t>Responsive - A server that is responsive, will respond to
        DHCPv6 client requests.</t>

        <t>Secondary Server - Second of out two DHCPv6 servers that participate
        in a failover relationship. Its failover partner is referred to as
        primary server. In active-passive mode this server typically does
        not handle client traffic and acts as a backup.</t>

        <t>Server - A DHCPv6 server that implements DHCPv6 failover.
        'Server' and 'failover endpoint' are synonymous only if the
        server participates in only one failover relationship. </t>

        <t>Unresponsive - A server that is unresponsive will not
        respond to DHCPv6 client requests.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The failover protocol design provides a means for cooperating
      DHCPv6 servers to work together to provide a DHCPv6 service
      with availability that is increased beyond that which could
      be provided by a single DHCPv6 server operating alone.  It
      is designed to protect DHCPv6 clients against server unreachability,
      including server failure and network partition. It is possible
      to deploy exactly two servers that are able to continue
      providing a lease on an IPv6 address <xref target="RFC3315"/>
      or on an IPv6 prefix <xref target="RFC3633"/>
      without the DHCPv6 client experiencing lease expiration or a
      reassignment of a lease to a different IPv6 address in the event
      of failure by one or the other of the two servers.</t>

      <t>This protocol defines active-passive mode, sometimes also
      called a hot standby model. This means that during normal
      operation one server is active (i.e. actively responds to
      clients' requests) while the second is passive (i.e. it does
      receive clients' requests, but does not respond to them and only
      maintains a copy of lease database and is ready to take over
      incoming queries in case of primary server
      failure). Active-active mode (i.e. both servers actively
      handling clients' requests) is currently not supported for the
      sake of simplicity. Such a mode is likely to be defined as an exension at a
      later time and will probably be based on <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-load-balancing" />.</t>

      <t>The failover protocol is designed to provide lease stability
      for leases with lease times beyond a short period.  Due in part to the
      additional overhead required as well as requirements to handle
      time skew between failover partners (See <xref target="time-skew"/>),
      failover is not suitable for leases shorter than 30 seconds. 
      The DHCPv6 Failover protocol MUST NOT be used for leases shorter 
      than 30 seconds.</t>

      <t>This design attempts to fulfill all DHCPv6 failover requirements
      defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-failover-requirements"/>.</t>

      <section title="Design Requirements">
        <t>The following requirements are not related to failover
        mechanism in general, but rather to this particular design.

        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Minimize Asymmetry - while there are two distinct roles
          in failover (primary and secondary server), the
          differences between those two roles should be as small as
          possible.   This will yield a simpler design as well as
          a simpler implementation of that design.</t>
        </list>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Features out of Scope: Load Balancing">
	<t>While it is tempting to extend DHCPv6 failover mechanism
	to also offer load balancing, as DHCPv4 failover did, this
	design does not do that. Here is the reasoning for this
	decision. In general case (not related to failover) load
	balancing solutions are used when each server is not able
	to handle total incoming traffic.  However, by the very
	definition, DHCPv6 failover is supposed to assume service
	availability despite failure of one server. That leads to
	conclusion that each server must be able to handle whole
	traffic. Therefore in properly provisioned setup, load
	balancing is not needed.</t>

        <t>It is likely that active-active mode that is essentially
        a load balancing will be defined as an extension in the
        near future.</t>

    </section> 

<section title="Protocol Overview">

  <t>The DHCPv6 Failover Protocol is defined as a communication between failover
  partners with all associated algorithms and mechanisms.  Failover
  communication is conducted over a TCP connection established between the
  partners. The protocol reuses the framing format specified in Section 5.1 of
  <xref target="RFC5460">DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery</xref>, but uses different
  message types. New failover-specific message types are listed in <xref
  target="msg-list" />. All information is sent over the connection as typical
  DHCPv6 messages that convey DHCPv6 options, following format defined in
  Section 22.1 of <xref target="RFC3315"/>.</t>

  <t>After initialization, the primary server establishes a TCP connection
  with its partner. The primary server sends a CONNECT message with initial
  parameters. Secondary server responds with CONNECTACK.</t>

  <t> If the primary server cannot immediately establish a connection with
  its partner, it will continue to attempt to establish a connection.  See
  <xref target="create-connections"/> for details. </t>

  <t>Depending on the failover state of each partner, they MUST
  initiate one of the binding update procedures. Each server MAY
  send an UPDREQ message to request its partner to send all updates
  that have not been sent yet (this case applies when the partner has
  an existing database and wants to update it). Alternatively, a
  server MAY choose to send an UPDREQALL message to request a full
  lease database transmission including all leases (this case applies
  in case of booting up new server after installation, corruption
  or complete loss of database, or other catastrophic failure).</t>

  <t>Servers exchange lease information by using BNDUPD messages.
  Depending on the local and remote state of a lease, a server may
  either accept or reject the update. Reception of lease update
  information is confirmed by responding with a BNDACK message with
  appropriate status. The majority of the messages sent over a
  failover TCP connection consists of BNDUPD and BNDACK messages.</t>

  <t>A subset of available resources (addresses or prefixes) is
  reserved for secondary server use. This is required for handling
  a case where both servers are able to communicate with clients,
  but unable to communicate with each other. After the initial
  connection is established, the secondary server requests a pool
  of available addresses by sending a POOLREQ message. The primary
  server assigns addresses to the secondary by sending a series of
  BNDUPD messages.  When this process is complete, the primary
  server sends a POOLRESP message to the secondary server.  The
  secondary server may initiate such pool request at any time when
  in communication with primary server.</t>

  <t>Failover servers use a lazy update mechanism to update their
  failover partner about changes to their lease state database.
  After a server performs any modifications to its lease state
  database (assign a new lease, extend, release or expire existing
  lease), it sends its response to the client's request
  first (performing the "regular" DHCPv6 operation) and then informs
  its failover partner using a BNDUPD message. This BNDUPD message
  SHOULD be sent soon after the response is sent to the DHCPv6
  client, but there is no specific requirement of a minimum time
  in which to do so.</t>

  <t>The major problem with lazy update mechanism is the case when
  the server crashes after sending a response to client, but before
  sending the lazy update to its partner (or when communication
  between partners is interrupted). To solve this problem, the concept
  known as the Maximum Client Lead Time (initially designed
  for DHCPv4 failover) is used.  The MCLT is the maximum amount of
  time that one server can extend a lease for a client's binding
  beyond the time known by its failover partner. See <xref
  target="mclt"/> for detailed desciption how the MCLT affects assigned
  lease times.</t>

  <t>Servers verify each others availability by periodically
  exchanging CONTACT messages. See <xref target="reachability"/> for
  discussion about detecting a partner's unreachability.</t>

  <t>A server that is being shut down transmits a DISCONNECT message,
  closes the connection with its failover partner and stops
  operation. A Server SHOULD transmit any pending lease updates before
  transmitting DISCONNECT message.</t>

  <section anchor="states-overview" title="Failover State Machine Overview">
    <t>The following section provides a simplified description of all
    states. For the sake of clarity and simplicity, it omits important
    details. For complete description, see <xref target="states"/>.
    In case of a disagreement between the simplified and complete description,
    please follow <xref target="states"/>.</t>

    <t>Each server MUST be in one of the well defines states. In each
    state a server may be either responsive (responds to clients'
    queries) or unresponsive (clients' queries are ignored).</t>

    <t>A server starts its operation in short-lived STARTUP state. A
    server determines its partner reachability and state and sets its
    own state based on that determination.  It typically
    returns back to the state it was in before shutdown, though the 
    details can be complicated.  
    See <xref target="transition-out-of-startup-state"/>.</t>

    <t>During typical operation when servers maintain communication,
    both are in NORMAL state. In that state only the primary responds to
    clients' requests. A secondary server is unresponsive.</t>

    <t>If a server discovers that its partner is no longer reachable,
    it goes to COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED state. A server must be
    extra cautious as it can't distingush if its partner is down
    or just communication between servers is interrupted. Since
    communication between partners is not possible, a server must
    act on the assumtion that its partner is up.  A failover server
    must follow a defined procedure, in particular, it MUST NOT
    extend any lease more than the MCLT beyond its partner's knowledge
    of the lease expiration time.  This imposes an additional burden
    on the server, in that clients will return to the server for
    lease renewals more frequently than they would otherwise.
    Therefore it is not recommended to operate for prolonged periods
    in this state.  Once communication is reestablished, a server may
    go into NORMAL, POTENTIAL-CONFLICT or PARTNER-DOWN state. It
    may also stay in COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED state if certain
    conditions are met.</t>

    <t>Once a server is switched into PARTNER-DOWN (when
    auto-partner-down is used or as a result of administrative
    action), it can extend leases, regardless of the original server
    that initially granted the lease. In that state server handles
    leases from its own pool, but once its own pool is depleted is also
    able to serve pool from
    its downed partner. MCLT restrictions no longer apply. Operation
    in this mode is less demanding for the server that remains operational,
    than in COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED state, but PARTNER-DOWN does
    not offer any kind of redundancy.  Even when in PARTNER-DOWN
    state, a failover server continues to attempt to connect with
    its failover partner.</t>

    <t>A server switches into RECOVER state when any of a variety 
    of conditions are encountered:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>When a backup server contacts its failover partner for the
      first time.</t>
      <t>When either server discovers that its failover partner has
      contacted it before but it has no local record of this contact.
      If the record of previous contact is held in the lease-state
      database, then this situation implies that the server has lost
      its lease state database.</t>
      <t>When its failover partner is in PARTNER-DOWN state.</t>
    </list>
    Any of these conditions signal that the server 
    needs to refresh its lease-state database from its partner. Once this
    operation is complete, it switches to RECOVER-WAIT and later
    to RECOVER-DONE.  See <xref target="transition-out-of-recover-wait-state"/>.</t>

    <t>Once servers reestablish connection, they discover each others'
    state. Depending on the conditions, they may return to NORMAL or
    move to POTENTINAL-CONFLICT if the partner is in a state that doesn't
    allow a simple re-integration of the server's lease state databases.
    It is a goal of this protocol to minimize the possibility
    that POTENTIAL-CONFLICT state is ever entered. Servers running in
    POTENTIAL-CONFLICT do not respond to clients' requests and work only on
    resolving potential conflicts. Once outstanding lease updates are
    exchanged, servers move to CONFLICT-DONE or NORMAL states.</t>

    <t>Servers that are recovering from potential conflicts and loose
    communication, switch to RESOLUTION-INTERRUPTED.</t>

    <t>A server that is being shut down sends a DISCONNECT message.
    See <xref target="msg-list"/>.  A server that receives a DISCONNECT message 
    moves into COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED state.</t>

  </section>

  <section anchor="msg-list" title="Messages">
    <t>The failover protocol is centered around the message exchanges used by
    one server to update its partner and respond to received updates.
    It should be noted that no specific formats or message type values are
    assigned in this document. Appropriate implementation details will be specified
    in a separate protocol specification document. The following list enumerates
    these messages:</t>

    <t>
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>BNDUPD - The binding update message is used to send the binding lease
      changes to the partner. One message may contain one or more lease
      updates. The partner is expected to respond with a BNDACK message.</t>
      <t>BNDACK - The binding acknowledgement is used for confirmation of the
      received BNDUPD message. It may contain a positive or negative response
      (e.g. due to detected lease conflict).</t>
      
      <t>POOLREQ - The Pool Request message is used by one server (typically
      secondary) to request allocation of resources (addresses or prefixes) from
      its partner. The partner responds with POOLRESP.</t>

      <t>POOLRESP - The Pool Response message is used by one server (typically
      primary) to repond to its partner's request for resources allocation. One
      POOLRESP message may contain more than one pool.</t>

      <t>UPDREQ - The update request message is used by one server to request
      that its partner send all binding database changes that has not been
      sent and confirmed already. Requested partner is expected to respond
      with zero or more BNDUPD messages, followed by UPDDONE that signals
      end of updates.</t>

      <t>UPDREQALL - The update request all is used by one server to request
      that all binding database information be sent in order to recover from a
      total loss of its binding database by the requesting server. Requested
      server responds with zero or more BNDUPD messages, followed by UPDDONE
      that signal end of updates.</t>

      <t>UPDDONE - The update done message is used by the responding server to
      indicate that all requested updates have been sent by the responding server
      and acked by the requesting server.</t>

      <t>CONNECT - The connect message is used by the primary server to
      establish a high level connection with the other server, and to transmit
      several important configuration data items between the servers. The
      partner is expected to confirm by responding with CONNECTACK message.</t>

      <t>CONNECTACK - The connect acknowledgement message is used by the
      secondary server to respond to a CONNECT message from the primary
      server.</t>
      <!-- tomek: do we want to make this bi-directional? I think it should work
           both ways, not only primary connecting to secondary, but in the
           opposite direction as well. -->
      
      <t>DISCONNECT - The disconnect message is used by either server when
      closing a connection and shutting down. No response is required for this
      message.</t>
      <!-- tomek: v4 doesn't have any DISCONNECTACK. Why? Perhaps we should add
           it. Servers that use failover are not pocket devices that must shut
           down in 0.001 seconds to conserve energy. It is ok to prolong the
           shutdown sequence by a second or two. It is reasonable to assume that
           some implementations will abort graceful shutdown if there is no
           response from the partner. Of course, such implementations would need
           some form of forced shutdown knob. -->
      
      <t>STATE - The state message is used by either server to inform its
      partner about a change of failover state. In some cases it may be used
      to also inform the partner about current state, e.g. after connection
      is established in COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED or PARTNER-DOWN states.</t>
      <!-- tomek: again, why is there no STATEACK message? -->

      <t>CONTACT - The contact message is used by either server to ensure that
      the other server continues to see the connection as opera- tional.  It
      MUST be transmitted periodically over every esta- blished connection if
      other message traffic is not flowing, and it MAY be sent at any time.</t>
      <!-- tomek: what about link failing in only one direction, e.g. uplink
      broken? Perhaps there should be some way to acknowledge CONTACT? -->

<section title="Connection Management">
  <section anchor="create-connections" title="Creating Connections">
    <t>Every primary server implementing the failover protocol
    SHOULD attempt to connect to all of its partners periodically,
    where the period is implementation dependent and SHOULD be
    configurable.  In the event that a connection has been rejected
    by a CONNECTACK message with a reject-reason option contained
    in it or a DISCONNECT message, a server SHOULD reduce the
    frequency with which it attempts to connect to that server but
    it SHOULD continue to attempt to connect periodically.</t>

    <t>Every secondary server implementing the failover protocol
    SHOULD listen for connection attempts from the primary server.
    </t>

    <t>When a connection attempt succeeds, the primary server which
    has initiated the connection attempt MUST send a CONNECT message
    down the connection.  </t>

    <t>When a connection attempt is received, the only information
    that the receiving server has is the IP address of the partner
    initiating a connection.  If it has any relationships with the
    connecting server for which it is a seconary server, it should
    just await the CONNECT message to determine which relationship
    this connection is to serve.</t>

    <t>If it has no secondary relationships with the connecting
    server, it SHOULD drop the connection.  The goal is to limit
    the resources expended dealing with attempts to create a spurious
    failover connection.</t>

    <t>To summarize -- a primary server MUST use a connection that it has
    initiated in order to send a CONNECT message.  Every server that
    is a secondary server in a relationship simply listens for connection
    attempts from the primary server.
    </t>

    <t>Once a connection is established, the primary server MUST send
    a CONNECT message across the connection.  A secondary server MUST
    wait for the CONNECT message from a primary server.  If the
    secondary server doesn't receive a CONNECT message from the
    primary server in an installation dependent amount of time, it MAY
    drop the connection.</t>

    <t>Every CONNECT message includes a TLS-request option, and if the
    CONNECTACK message does not reject the CONNECT message and the
    TLS-reply option says TLS MUST be used, then the servers will
    immediately enter into TLS negotiation.</t>

    <t>Once TLS negotiation is complete, the primary server MUST
    resend the CONNECT message on the newly secured TLS connection and
    then wait for the CONNECTACK message in response.  The TLS-request
    and TLS-reply options MUST NOT appear in either this second
    CONNECT or its associated CONNECTACK message as they had in the
    first messages.</t>

    <t>The second message sent over a new connection (either a bare
    TCP connection or a connection utilizing TLS) is a STATE message.
    Upon the receipt of this message, the receiver can consider
    communications up.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Endpoint Identification">
    <t>The proper operation of the failover protocol requires more than
    the transmission of messages between one server and the other.  Each
    endpoint might seem to be a single DHCPv6 server, but in fact there
    are situations where additional flexibility in configuration
    is useful.  A failover endpoint is always associated with a set
    of DHCPv6 prefixes that are configured on the DHCPv6 server where
    the endpoint appears.  A DHCPv6 prefix MUST NOT be associated with
    more than one failover endpoint.</t>

    <t>The failover protocol SHOULD be configured with one failover
    relationship between each pair of failover servers. In this
    case there is one failover endpoint for that relationship on
    each failover partner.  This failover relationship MUST have a
    unique name.</t>

    <t>There is typically little need for additional relationships between
    any two servers but there MAY be more than one failover relationship
    between two servers -- however each MUST have a unique relationship
    name.</t>

    <t>Any failover endpoint can take actions and hold unique states.</t>

    <t>This document frequently describes the behavior of the protocol in
    terms of primary and secondary servers, not primary and secondary
    failover endpoints.  However, it is important to remember that every
    'server' described in this document is in reality a failover endpoint
    that resides in a particular process, and that several failover
    end-points may reside in the same server process.</t>

    <t>It is not the case that there is a unique failover endpoint for
    each prefix that participates in a failover relationship.  On one
    server, there is (typically) one failover endpoint per partner,
    regardless of how many prefixes are managed by that combination of
    partner and role.  Conversely, on a particular server, any given
    prefix will be associated with exactly one failover endpoint.</t>

    <t>When a connection is received from the partner, the unique failover
    endpoint to which the message is directed is determined solely by
    the IP address of the partner, the relationship-name, and the role
    of the receiving server.</t>

<section title="Resource Allocation">
  <t>Currently there are two allocation algorithms defined for
  resources (addresses or prefixes). Additional allocation schemes
  may be defined as future extensions.</t>

  <t>
  <list style="numbers">
    <t>Proportional Allocation - This allocation algorithm is a
    direct application of the algorithm defined in <xref target="dhcpv4-failover"/>
    to DHCPv6. Remaining available resources are split between the primary and
    secondary servers in a configured proportion. Released resources
    are always returned to the primary server.  Primary and secondary
    servers may initiate a rebalancing procedure when disparity
    between resources available to each server reaches a preconfigured
    threshold. Only resources that are not leased to any clients
    are "owned" by one of the servers. This algorithm is particularly
    well suited for scenarios where amount of available resources
    is limited, as may be the case with prefix delegation. See <xref
    target="alloc-classic"/> for details.</t>

    <t>Independent Allocation - This allocation algorithm assumes
    that available resources are split between primary and secondary
    servers as well.  In this case, however, resources are assigned
    to a specific server for all time, regardless if they are
    available or currently used. This algorithm is much simpler
    than proportional allocation, because resource imbalance doesn't
    have to be checked and there is no rebalancing for independent
    allocation. This algorithm is particularly well suited for
    scenarios where the there is an abundance of available resources
    which is typically the case for DHCPv6 address
    allocation.  See <xref target="alloc-separated"/> for details.</t>
  </list>
  </t>

  <section anchor="alloc-classic" title="Proportional Allocation">

    <t>In this allocation scheme, each server has its own pool of
    available resources. Remaining available resources are split between the
    primary and secondary servers in a configured proportion.
    Note that a resource is not "owned" by a
    particular server throughout its entire lifetime.  Only a resource
    which is available is "owned" by a particular server -- once it
    has been leased to a client, it is not owned by either failover
    partner.  When it finally becomes available again, it will be
    owned initially by the primary server, and it may or may not be
    allocated to the secondary server by the primary server.</t>

    <t>The flow of a resource is as follows: initially a resource
    is owned by the primary server.  It may be allocated to the
    secondary server if it is available, and then it is owned by the
    secondary server.  Either server can allocate available resources
    which they own to clients, in which case they cease
    to own them.  When the client releases the resource or the
    lease on it expires, it will again become available and will be
    owned by the primary.</t>

    <!-- tomek: if we are told that the text is too long, this paragraph
    is explanatory and does not really add any specific value. Let's
    keep it for now, though. -->
    <t>A resource will not become owned by the server which allocated
    it initially when it is released or the lease expires because, in
    general, that server will have had to replenish its pool of
    available resources well in advance of any likely lease
    expirations.  Thus, having a particular resource cycle back to the
    secondary might well put the secondary more out of balance with
    respect to the primary instead of enhancing the balance of
    available addresses or prefixes between them.</t>

    <!-- issue 1: Done
	 tomek: the vocabulary seems ok to me. There are no explicit
	 references to addresses, but rather resources (address or prefix).
    <t>TODO: Need to rework this v4-specific vocabulary to v6, once we
    decide how things will look like in v6.</t> -->

    <t>Pools governed by proportional allocation are used for allocation when
    the server is in all states, except PARTNER-DOWN.  In PARTNER-DOWN state the
    healthy partner can allocate from either pool (both its own and its
    partner's). This allocation and maintenance of these address pools is an
    area of some sensitivity, since the goal is to maintain a more or less
    constant ratio of available addresses between the two servers.</t>

    TODO: Reuse rest of the description from section 5.4 from <xref
    target="dhcpv4-failover"/> here.

    Done 10/16/12 Kim
    -->

    <t>The initial allocation when the servers first integrate is
    triggered by the POOLREQ message from the secondary to the
    primary.  This is followed by the POOLRESP message where the
    primary tells the secondary how many resources it allocated to
    the secondary.  Then, the primary sends the allocated resources
    to the secondary via BNDUPD messages.  The POOLREQ/POOLRESP
    message is a trigger to the primary to perform a scan of its
    database and to ensure that the secondary has enough resources
    (based on some configured ratio).</t>

    <t>The primary server SHOULD examine some or all of its database
    from time to time to determine if resources should be shifted
    between the primary and secondary (in either direction).  The
    POOLREQ/POOLRESP message exchange allows the secondary server
    to explicitly request that the primary server examine the
    entirety of its database to ensure that the secondary has the
    approprite resources available.</t>

    <t>Servers frequently have several kinds of resources available
    on a particular network segment.  The failover protocol assumes
    that both primary and secondary servers are configured in such
    a way that each knows the type and number of resources on every
    network segment participating in the failover protocol.  The
    primary server is responsible for allocating the secondary
    server the correct proportion of available resources of each
    kind, and the secondary server MUST be configured
    in such a way that it can tell the kind of every resource based
    solely on the IP or prefix address itself.</t>

    <t>The resources are delegated to the secondary using the BNDUPD
    message with a state of FREE_BACKUP, which indicates the resource
    is now available for allocation by the secondary.  Once the
    message is sent, the primary MUST NOT use these resources for
    allocation to DHCPv6 clients.</t>

    <t>Available resources can be delegated back to the primary server
    in certain cases. BNDUPD will contain state FREE for leases that
    were previously in FREE_BACKUP state.</t>

    <t>The POOLREQ/POOLRESP message exchange initiated by the
    secondary is valid at any time both partners remain in contact,
    and the primary server SHOULD,
    whenever it receives the POOLREQ message, scan its database of
    prefixes and determine if the secondary needs more resources
    from any of the prefixes. </t>

    <t>In order to support a reasonably dynamic balance of the
    resources between the failover partners, the primary server
    needs to do additional work to ensure that the secondary server
    has as many resources as it needs (but that it doesn't have
    more than it needs).</t>

    <t>The primary server SHOULD examine the balance of available
    resources between the primary and secondary for a particular
    prefix whenever the number of available resources for either
    the primary or secondary changes by more than a configured
    limit.  The primary server SHOULD adjust the available resource
    balance as required to ensure the configured resource balance,
    excepting that the primary server SHOULD employ some threshold
    mechanism to such a balance adjustment in order to minimize the
    overhead of maintaining this balance.</t>

    <t>An example of a threshold approach is: do not attempt to
    re-balance the prefixes on the primary and secondary until the
    out of balance value exceeds a configured value.</t>

    <t>The primary server can, at any time, send an available
    resource to the secondary using a BNDUPD with the state BACKUP.
    The primary server can attempt to take an available resource
    away from the secondary by sending a BNDUPD with the state FREE.
    If the secondary accepts the BNDUPD, then the resource is now available
    to the primary and not available to the secondary.  Of course,
    the secondary MUST reject that BNDUPD if it has already used
    that resource for a DHCP client.</t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="alloc-separated" title="Independent Allocation">
    <t>In this allocation scheme, available resources are permanently (until
    server configuration changes) split
    between servers. Available resources are split between the primary and
    secondary servers as part of initial connection establishment. Once
    resources are allocated to each server, there is no need to
    reassign them. The resource allocation is algorithmic in nature,
    and does not require a message exchange for each resources allocated.
    This algorithm is simpler than proportional
    allocation since it requires similar initial communication, but does not
    require a rebalancing mechanism. It assumes
    that the pool assigned to each server will never deplete. That is
    often a reasonable assumption for IPv6 addresses (e.g. servers are
    often assigned a /64 pool that contains many more addresses than existing
    electronic devices on Earth). This allocation mechanism SHOULD be
    used for IPv6 addresses, unless the configured address pool is small
    or is otherwise administratively limited.</t>

    <t>Once each server is assigned a resource pool during initial
    connection establishment, it may allocate assigned resources to
    clients. Once a client releases a resource or its lease is expired,
    the returned resource returns to pool for the server that leased it.
    Resources never changes servers.</t>

    <t>Resources using the independent allocation approach are ignored
    when a server processes a POOLREQ message.</t>

    <t>During COMMUNICATION-INTERRUPTED events, a partner MAY continue
    extending existing leases when requested by clients. A healthy
    partner MUST NOT lease resources that were assigned to its downed
    partner and later released by a client unless it is in PARTNER-DOWN state.
    Server SHOULD use its own pool first before starting new assignements
    from its downed partner's pool. As the assumption is that independent
    allocation should be used only when available resources are vast and
    not expected to be fully used at any given time, it is very unlikely
    that the server will ever need to use its downed partner pools. This
    makes a recovery even after prolonged down-time much easier.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Choosing Allocation Algorithm">
    <t>All implementations MUST support proportional allocation algorithm and SHOULD
    support independent allocation. If the implementation implements both and
    lets the user choose between them, the default algorithm used SHOULD be
    proportional allocation algorithm.</t>
    <t>Proportional allocation mechanism is more flexible as it can dynamically
    rebalance available resources between servers. That balance includes additional
    burden for the servers and generates more traffic between servers. Proportional
    algorithm can be considered more efficient at managing available resources,
    compared to idenpendent. That is important aspect when working in a network that
    is nearing address and/or prefix depletion.</t>

    <t>Independent allocation can be used when the number of available resources
    are large and there is no realistic danger of running out of resources.
    Use of the independent allocation makes communication between partners simpler.
    It also makes recovery easier and potential conflict less likely to appear.</t>

    <t>Typically independent allocation is used for IPv6 addresses, because even
    for /64 pools a server will never run out of addresses to assign, so there
    is no need to rebalance. For the prefix delegation mechanism, available
    resources are typically much smaller, so there is a danger of running out of
    prefixes. Therefore typically proportional allocation will be used for
    prefix delegations. Independent allocation still may be used, but the
    implication must be well understood. For example in a network that delegates
    /64 prefixes out out /48 prefix (so there can be up to 65536 prefixes
    delegated) and a 1000 requesting routers, it is safe to use independent
    allocation.</t>

    <t>It should be stressed out that independent allocation algorithm SHOULD NOT
    be used when number of resources is limited and there is a realistic danger of
    depleting resources. If this recommendation is violated, it may lead to a case,
    when one server denies clients due to pool depletion despite the fact the the
    other partner still have many resources available.</t>

    <t>With independent allocation it is very unlikely to remaining healthy
    server to allocate resources from its unavailable partner's pool. That makes
    recovery easier and any potential conflicts are less likely to appear.</t>

  <t>In most DHCP servers a resource (an IP address or a prefix) can
  take on several different binding-status values, sometimes also
  called lease states.  While no two DHCP server implementations probably have
  exactly the same possible binding-status values, <xref target="RFC3315"/>
  enforces some commonality among the general semantics of the
  binding-status values used by various DHCP server implementations.</t>

  binding-status values must be defined.  It is not expected that

    <t>In case of servers operating in active-passive mode, while

    <t>The size of the resource pool allocated to the secondary is
    specified as a percentage of the currently available resources.
    Thus, as the number of available resources changes on the primary
    server, the number of resources available to the secondary
    server MUST also change, although the frequency of the changes
    made to the secondary server's pool of address resources SHOULD
    be low enough to not use significant processing power or network
    bandwidth.</t>

    <t>
    The required size of this private pool allocated to the secondary
    server is based only on the arrival rate of new DHCP clients
    and the length of expected downtime of the primary server, and
    is not directly influenced by the total number of DHCP clients
    supported by the server pair.</t>

  <section title="Failover Mechanisms">
    <t>This section lays out an overview of the communication between
    partners and other mechanisms required for failover operation. As
    this is a design document, not a protocol specification,
    high level ideas are presented without implementation
    specific details (e.g. on-wire protocol formats).</t>
    <section anchor="time-skew" title="Time Skew">
      <t>Partners exchange information about known lease states. To
      reliably compare a known lease state with an update received from a
      partner, servers must be able to reliably compare the times stored
      in the known lease state with the times received in the update.
      Although a simple approach would be to require both partners to use
      synchronized time, e.g. by using NTP, such a service may not always
      be available in some scenarios that failover expects to cover.
      Therefore a mechanism to measure and track
      relative time differences between servers is necessary. To do so,
      each message MUST contain information about the time 
      of the transmission in the time context of the transmitter.
      The transmitting server MUST set this as close to the
      actual transmission as possible. The receiving partner MUST store its
      own timestamp of reception as close to the actual reception as
      possible. The received timestamp information is then compared with local timestamp.</t>

      <t>To account for packet delay variation (jitter), the measured
      difference is not used directly, but rather the moving average of last
      TIME_SKEW_PKTS_AVG packets time difference is calculated. This averaged
      value is referred to as the time skew. Note that the time skew algorithm
      allows cooperation between clients with completely desynchronized
      clocks as well as those whose desynchronization itself is not constant.</t>

    <section anchor="lazy-updates" title="Lazy updates">
      <t>Lazy update refers to the requirement placed on a server implementing a
      failover protocol to update its failover partner whenever the binding
      database changes.  A failover protocol which didn't support lazy update
      would require the failover partner update to complete before a DHCPv6
      server could respond to a DHCPv6 client request. Such approach is often
      referred to as 'lockstep' and is the opposite of lazy updates. The lazy
      update mechanism allows a server to allocate a new or extend an existing
      lease and then update its failover partner as time permits.</t>

      <t>Although the lazy update mechanism does not introduce additional
      delays in server response times, it introduces other
      difficulties.  The key problem with lazy update is that when a
      server fails after updating a client with a particular lease
      time and before updating its partner, the partner will believe
      that a lease has expired even though the client still retains a
      valid lease on that address or prefix.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="mclt" title="MCLT concept">
      <t>In order to handle problem introduced by lazy updates (see
      <xref target="lazy-updates"/>), a period of time known as the
      "Maximum Client Lead Time" (MCLT) is defined and must be known
      to both the primary and secondary servers.  Proper use of this
      time interval places an upper bound on the difference allowed
      between the lease time provided to a DHCPv6 client by a server and
      the lease time known by that server's failover partner.</t>

      <t>The MCLT is typically much less than the lease time that a
      server has been configured to offer a client, and so some
      strategy must exist to allow a server to offer the configured
      lease time to a client.  During a lazy update the updating
      server typically updates its partner with a potential expiration
      time which is longer than the lease time previously given to the
      client and which is longer than the lease time that the server
      has been configured to give a client.  This allows that server
      to give a longer lease time to the client the next time the
      client renews its lease, since the time that it will give to the
      client will not exceed the MCLT beyond the potential expiration
      time acknowledged by its partner.</t>

      <t>The fundamental relationship on which much of the correctness
      of this protocol depends is that the lease expiration time
      known to a DHCPv6 client MUST NOT be greater by more than the MCLT
      beyond the potential expiration time known to that server's
      failover partner.</t>

      <t>The remainder of this section makes the above fundamental
      relationship more explicit.</t>

      <t>This protocol requires a DHCPv6 server to deal with several
      different lease intervals and places specific restrictions on
      their relationships. The purpose of these restrictions is to
      allow the other server in the pair to be able to make certain
      assumptions in the absence of an ability to communicate between
      servers.</t>

      <t>The different times are:
      <list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="desired valid lifetime:">
          <vspace/>
          The desired valid lifetime is the lease interval that a DHCPv6
          server would like to give to a DHCPv6 client in the absence of
          any restrictions imposed by the failover protocol.  Its
          determination is outside of the scope of this
          protocol. Typically this is the result of external
          configuration of a DHCPv6 server.
        </t>
        <t hangText="actual valid lifetime:">
          <vspace/>
          The actual valid lifetime is the lease interval that a DHCPv6 server
          gives out to a DHCPv6 client.
          It may be shorter than the desired valid lifetime (as explained below).
        </t>
        <t hangText="potential valid lifetime:">
          <vspace/>
          The potential valid lifetime is the potential lease expiration interval the
          local server tells to its partner in a BNDUPD message.
        </t>
        <t hangText="acknowledged potential valid lifetime:">
          <vspace/>
          The acknowledged potential valid lifetime is the potential lease
          interval the partner server has most recently acknowledged in
          a BNDACK message.
        </t>
      </list>
      </t>

   <section title="MCLT example">
     <t>The following example demonstrates the MCLT concept in practice. The
     values used are arbitrarily chosen are and not a recommendation for
     actual values. The MCLT in this case is 1 hour.  The desired valid
     lifetime is 3 days, and its renewal time is half the valid lifetime.</t>

     <t>When a server makes an offer for a new lease on an IP address to a
     DHCPv6 client, it determines the desired valid lifetime (in this
     case, 3 days).  It then examines the acknowledged potential valid
     lifetime (which in this case is zero) and determines the remainder
     of the time left to run, which is also zero.  It adds the
     MCLT to this value.  Since the actual valid lifetime cannot be allowed to exceed
     the remainder of the current acknowledged potential valid lifetime
     plus the MCLT, the offer made to the client is for the remainder
     of the current acknowledged potential valid lifetime (i.e. zero)
     plus the MCLT.  Thus, the actual valid lifetime is 1 hour.</t>

     <t>Once the server has sent the REPLY to the DHCPv6 client, it
     will update its failover partner with the lease information.
     However, the desired potential valid lifetime will be composed of one
     half of the current actual valid lifetime added to the desired
     valid lifetime. Thus, the failover partner is updated with a
     BNDUPD with a potential valid lifetime of 3 days + 1/2 hour.</t>

     <t>When the primary server receives a BNDACK to its update of the
     secondary server's (partner's) potential valid lifetime, it records
     that as the acknowledged potential valid lifetime.  A server MUST
     NOT send a BNDACK in response to a BNDUPD message until it is sure
     that the information in the BNDUPD message has been updated in its
     lease database.  Thus, the primary server in this case can be sure
     that the secondary server has recorded the potential lease
     interval in its stable storage when the primary server receives a
     BNDACK message from the secondary server.</t>

     <t>When the DHCPv6 client attempts to renew at T1 (approximately one
     half an hour from the start of the lease), the primary server
     again determines the desired valid lifetime, which is still 3
     days.  It then compares this with the original acknowledged
     potential valid lifetime (3 days + 1/2 hour) and adjusts for the
     time passed since the secondary was last updated (1/2 hour).  Thus
     the time remaining of the acknowledged potential valid interval is
     3 days.  Adding the MCLT to this yields 3 days plus 1 hour, which
     is more than the desired valid lifetime of 3 days.  So the client
     is renewed for the desired valid lifetime -- 3 days.</t>

     <t>When the primary DHCPv6 server updates the secondary DHCPv6 server
     after the DHCPv6 client's renewal REPLY is complete, it will calculate
     the desired potential valid lifetime as the T1 fraction of the
     actual client valid lifetime (1/2 of 3 days this time = 1.5 days).
     To this it will add the desired client valid lifetime of 3 days,
     yielding a total desired potential valid lifetime of 4.5
     days.  In this way, the primary attempts to have the secondary
     always "lead" the client in its understanding of the client's
     valid lifetime so as to be able to always offer the client the
     desired client valid lifetime.</t>

     <t>Once the initial actual client valid lifetime of the MCLT is past,
     the protocol operates effectively like the DHCPv6 protocol does
     today in its behavior concerning valid lifetimes. However, the
     guarantee that the actual client valid lifetime will never exceed
     the remaining acknowledged partner server potential valid lifetime by more
     than the MCLT allows full recovery from a variety of failures.</t>

 <section anchor="reachability" title="Unreachability detection">
   <t>Each partner MUST maintain a FO_SEND timer for each failover
   connection. The FO_SEND timer is reset every time any message is
   transmitted.  If the timer reaches the FO_SEND_MAX value, a CONTACT
   message is transmitted and timer is reset. The CONTACT message may be
   transmitted at any time. Implementation MAY use additional mechanisms
   to detect partner unreachability.</t>

   <t>Implementors are advised to keep in mind that the timer based
   CONTACT message mechanism is not perfect and may not detect some
   failures. In particular, if the partner is using one interface to
   reach clients ("downlink") and another to reach its partner ("uplink"),
   it is possible that communication with the clients will break,
   yet the mechanism will still claim full reachability. For that reason
   it is beneficial to share the same interface for client traffic
   and communication with the failover partner. That approach may
   have drawbacks in some network topologies.</t>

    <!-- issue 4 
    TODO: Describe controlled re-allocation of released/expired
    leases to different clients.

    Done 10/16/12 Kim
    -->
    <!-- see section 5.2.2 in v4 failover -->

    <t>When in PARTNER-DOWN state there is a waiting period after
    which a resource can be re-allocated to another client.  For
    resources which are available when the server enters PARTNER-DOWN
    state, the period is the MCLT from the entry into PARTNER-DOWN
    state.  For resources which are not available when the server
    enters PARTNER-DOWN state, the period is the MCLT after the
    later of the following times: the potential valid lifetime, the
    most recently transmitted potential valid lifetime, the most
    recently received acknowledged potential valid lifetime, and
    the most recently transmitted acknowledged potential valid
    lifetime.  If this time would be earlier than the current time
    plus the MCLT, then the time the server entered PARTNER-DOWN
    state plus the maximum-client-lead-time is used.</t>

    <!-- I don't think we want to discuss these paragraphs from the
     v4 draft.  Experience shows that nobody wants to live with MCLT
     restrictions in PARTNER-DOWN state.

    Two options exist for lease times given out while in PARTNER-DOWN
    state, with different ramifications flowing from each.

    If the server wishes the Failover protocol to protect it from loss of
    stable storage in PARTNER-DOWN state, then it should ensure that the
    MCLT based lease time restrictions in section 5.1 are maintained,
    even in PARTNER-DOWN state.

    If the server wishes to forego the protection of the Failover proto-
    col in the event of loss of stable storage, then it need recognize no
    restrictions on actual client lease times while in PARTNER-DOWN
    state.

    -->

    <t>In any other state, a server cannot reallocate a resource from one
    client to another without first notifying its partner (through a
    BNDUPD message) and receiving acknowledgement (through a BNDACK mes-
    sage) that its partner is aware that that first client is not using
    the resource.</t>

    <t>This could be modeled in the following way.  Though this specific
    implementation is in no way required, it may serve to better illus-
    trate the concept.</t>

    <t>An "available" resource on a server may be allocated to any client.
    A resource which was leased to a client and which expired or was
    released by that client would take on a new state, EXPIRED or
    RELEASED respectively.  The partner server would then be notified
    that this resource was EXPIRED or RELEASED through a BNDUPD.  When
    the sending server received the BNDACK for that resource showing it
    was FREE, it would move the resource from EXPIRED or RELEASED to
    FREE, and it would be available for allocation by the primary server
    to any clients.</t>

    <t>A server MAY reallocate a resource in the EXPIRED or RELEASED
    state to the same client with no restrictions provided it has not
    sent a BNDUPD message to its partner.  This situation would exist if
    the lease expired or was released after the transition into
    PARTNER-DOWN state, for instance.</t>

  <section title="Receiving Binding Update">

    <!-- see v4-failover-12, section 7.1.2 -->
    <t>When a server receives a BNDUPD message, it needs to decide how to
    process the binding update transaction it contains and whether that
    transaction represents a conflict of any sort. The conflict resolution
    process MUST be used on the receipt of every BNDUPD message, not just those
    that are received while in POTENTIAL-CONFLICT state, in order to increase
    the robustness of the protocol.</t>
    
    <t>There are three sorts of conflicts:
    <list style="numbers">
      <t>Two clients, one resource - This is the duplicate resource allocation
      conflict. There two different clients each allocated the same resource. See
      <xref target="conflict-resolution"/>.</t>
      <t>Two resources, one client conflict - This conflict exists when a client
      on one server is associated with a one resource, and on the other server
      with a different resource in the same or related subnet. This does not
      refer to the case where a single client has resources in multiple
      different subnets or administrative domains (i.e. a mobile client that
      changed its location), but rather the case where on
      the same subnet the client has a lease on one IP address in one server
      and on a different IP address on the other server.
      
      <!-- how to start new paragraph within the same bullet? -->
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>

      This conflict may or may not be a problem for a given DHCP server
      implementation and policy. If implementations and policies allow, both
      resources can be assigned to a given client. In the event that a DHCP
      server requires that a DHCP client have only one outstanding lease of a
      given type, the conflict MUST be resolved by accepting the lease which has
      the latest CLTT.

      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      It should be further clarified that DHCPv6 protocol makes
      assignments based on (client DUID, resource type, iaid)
      triplet. The possibility of using different IAIDs was omitted in
      this paragraph for clarity. If one client is assigned multiple
      resources of the same type, but with different IAIDs, there is
      no conflict. Also, iaid values for different resource types are
      orthogonal, i.e. IA_NA with iaid=1 is different than IA_PD with
      iaid=1 and there is no conflict.
      </t>

      <t>binding-status conflict - This is normal conflict, where one server is
      updating the other with newer information. See <xref
      target="conflict-resolution"/> for details of how to resolve these
      conflicts.</t>

      <t>The server receiving a lease update from its partner must evaluate the
      received lease information to see if it is consistent with already known
      state and decide which information - the previously known or that just received -
      is "better". The server should take into consideration the following
      aspects: if the lease is already assigned to a specific client, who had
      contact with client recently, start time of the lease, etc.</t>

      <t>When analyzing a BNDUPD message from a partner server, if there is

      BNDUPD with reject-reason "Missing binding information".</t>

      <t>If the resource in the BNDUPD is not a resource associated with
      the failover endpoint which received the BNDUPD message, then reject
      it with reject-reason "Illegal IP address or prefix (not part of any
      address or prefix pool)".</t>
      <!-- issue 12: do we want separate reject-reason for prefixes? -->

      <t>Every BNDUPD message SHOULD contain a client-last-transaction-time
      option, which MUST, if it appears, be the time that the server last
      interacted with the DHCP client.  It MUST NOT be, for instance, the
      time that the lease on an IP address expired.  If there has been no
      interaction with the DHCP client in question (or there is no DHCP
      client presently associated with this resource), then there will be
      no client-last-transaction-time option in the BNDUPD message.</t>

      <t>The list in <xref target="tbl-conflict-resolution"/> presents the conflict
      resolution outcome. To "accept" BNDUPD means to update the server's
      bindings database with the information contained in the BNDUDP and once
      the update is complete, send a BNDACK message corresponding to the BNDUPD
      message. To "reject" a BNDUPD means to lease the server's binding database
      unchangeg and to respond to the BNDUPD with BNDACK
      with a rejest-reason option included.</t>

      then it MUST NOT be considered later than the client-last-transaction-time
      in the receiving server's binding.  If the BNDUPD contains a client-last-
      transaction-time value and the receiving server's binding does not, then
      the client-last-transaction-time value in the BNDUPD MUST be considered
      later than the server's.</t>

      <t>The lease update may be accepted or rejected.  Rejection SHOULD NOT
      change the flag in a lease that says that it should be transmitted to the
      failover partner.  If this flag is set, then it should be transmitted, but
      if it is not already set, the rejection of a lease state update SHOULD NOT
      trigger an automatic update of the failover partner sending the rejected
      update.  The potential for update storms is too great, and in the unusual
      case where the servers simply can't agree, that disagreement is better
      than an update storm.
      </t>

    <!-- <t>Discussion: There will definitely be different types of update
      rejections. For example, this will allow a server to treat differently a
      case when receiving a new lease that it previously haven't seen than a
      case when partner sents old version of a lease for which a newer state is
      known.</t>-->

      <t>Upon acceptance of a binding lease, server must notify its partner
      that it updated its database. Server SHOULD NOT send BNDACK before its

    <section anchor="state-machine-operation" title="State Machine Operation">

      <t>Each server (or, more accurately, failover endpoint) can take
      on a variety of failover states.  These states play a crucial role
      in determining the actions that a server will perform when
      processing a request from a DHCPv6 client as well as dealing with
      changing external conditions (e.g., loss of connection to a failover
      partner).</t>

      <t> The failover state in which a server is running controls the following
      behaviors: </t>
        <t><list style="symbols">

          <t>Responsiveness -- the server is either responsive to DHCPv6
          client requests or it is not.</t>

          <t>Allocation Pool -- which pool of addresses (or prefixes) can be
          used for advertisement on receipt of a SOLICIT or allocation on receipt
	  of a REQUEST message.</t>

          <t>MCLT -- ensure that valid lifetimes are not beyond what the partner
          has acked plus the MCLT (or not).</t>

        </list></t>

      <t>A server will transition from one failover state to another based
      on the specific values held by the following state variables:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">

          <t>Current failover state.</t>

          <t>Communications status (OK or not OK).</t>

          <t>Partner's failover state (if known).</t>

        </list></t>

      <t>Several events can cause the transition from one failover state to
      another.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">

          <t>Change in communications status (OK or not OK);</t>

          <t>Change in partner's failover state;</t>

	  <t>Explicit administrative action;</t>

          <t>Receipt of particular messages;</t>

          <t>Expiration of timers.</t>

        </list></t>

      <t>Whenever either of the last two of the above state variables
      changes state, the state machine is invoked, which may then trigger a
      change in the current failove state.  Thus, whenever the communications
      status changes, the state machine processing is invoked.  This may or
      may not result in a change in the current failover state.</t>

      <t>Whenever a server transitions to a new failover state, the new state
      MUST be communicated to its failover partner in a STATE message if the
      communications status is OK.  In addition, whenever a server makes a
      transition into a new state, it MUST record the new state, its current
      understanding of its partner's state, and the time at which it entered the
      new state in stable storage.</t>

      <t>The following state transition diagram gives a condensed view of the
      state machine.  If there is a difference between the words describing a
      particular state and the diagram below, the words should be considered
      authoritative.</t>

      <t>In the state transition diagram below, the "+" or "-" in the upper
      right corner of each state is a notation about whether communication is
      ongoing with the other server.</t>

    <section anchor="state-startup" title="STARTUP State">

      <t>The STARTUP state affords an opportunity for a server to
      probe its partner server, before starting to service DHCP
      clients.  When in the STARTUP state, a server attempts to
      learn its partner's state and determine (using that information
      if it is available) what state it should enter.</t>

      <t>The STARTUP state is not shown with any specific state
      transitions in the <xref target="endpoint-state-machine">state machine
      diagram</xref> because the processing during the STARTUP state
      can cause the server to transition to any of the other states,
      so that specific state transition arcs would only obscure
      other information.</t>

      <section anchor="operation-in-startup-state" title="Operation in STARTUP State">

        <t>The server MUST NOT be responsive in STARTUP state.</t>

        <t>Whenever a STATE message is sent to the partner while
        in STARTUP state the STARTUP flag MUST be set in the message
        and the previously recorded failover state MUST be placed
        in the server-state option.</t>

      </section> <!-- operation-in-startup-state -->

      <section anchor="transition-out-of-startup-state" title="Transition Out of STARTUP State">

        <t>The following algorithm is followed every time the
        server initializes itself, and enters STARTUP state.</t>

        <t>Step 1:</t>

        <t>If there is any record in stable storage of a previous
        failover state for this server, set PREVIOUS-STATE to the
        last recorded value in stable storage, and go to Step 2.</t>

        <t>If there is no record of any previous failover state in
        stable storage for this server, then set the PREVIOUS-STATE
        to RECOVER and set the TIME-OF-FAILURE to 0.  This will
        allow two servers which already have lease information to
        synchronize themselves prior to operating.</t>

        <t>In some cases, an existing server will be commissioned
        as a failover server and brought back into operation where
        its partner is not yet available.  In this case, the newly
        commissioned failover server will not operate until its
        partner comes online  -- but it has operational responsibilities
        as a DHCP server nonetheless.  To properly handle this
        situation, a server SHOULD be configurable in such a way
        as to move directly into PARTNER-DOWN state after the startup
        period expires if it has been unable to contact its partner
        during the startup period.</t>

        <t>Step 2:</t>

	<t>Implementations will differ in the ways that they deal
	with the state machine for failover endpoint states.  In
	many cases, state transitions will occur when communications
	goes from "OK" to failoed, or from failed to "OK", and some
	implementations will implement a portion of their state
	machine processing based on these changes.</t>
	
	<t>In these cases, during startup, if the previous state
	is one where communications was "OK", then set the previous
	state to the state that is the result of the communications
	failed state transition when in that state (if such transition
	exists -- some states don't have a communications failed
	state transition, since they allow both communications OK
	and failed).</t>

        <t>Step 3:</t>

        <t>Start the STARTUP state timer.  The time that a server
        remains in the STARTUP state (absent any communications
        with its partner) is implementation dependent but SHOULD
        be short.  It SHOULD be long enough for a TCP connection
        to be created to a heavily loaded partner across a slow
        network.</t>

        <t>Step 4:</t>

        <t>Attempt to create a TCP connection to the failover partner.</t>

        <t>Step 5:</t>

        <t>Wait for "communications OK".</t>

        <t>When and if communications become "okay", clear the STARTUP
        flag, and set the current state to the PREVIOUS-STATE.</t>

        <t>If the partner is in PARTNER-DOWN state, and if the time
        at which it entered PARTNER-DOWN state (as received in the
        start-time-of-state option in the STATE message) is later
        than the last recorded time of operation of this server,
        then set CURRENT-STATE to RECOVER.  If the time at which
        it entered PARTNER-DOWN state is earlier than the last
        recorded time of operation of this server, then set
        CURRENT-STATE to POTENTIAL-CONFLICT.</t>

        <t>Then, transition to the current state and take the
        "communications OK" state transition based on the current
        state of this server and the partner.</t>

        <t>Step 6:</t>

        <t>If the startup time expires the server SHOULD transition
        to the PREVIOUS-STATE.</t>

    <section anchor="state-partner-down" title="PARTNER-DOWN State">

    <t>PARTNER-DOWN state is a state either server can enter.  When
    in this state, the server assumes that it is the only server
    operating and serving the client base. If one server is in
    PARTNER-DOWN state, the other server MUST NOT be operating.</t>

    <t>A server can enter PARTNER-DOWN state either as a result of 
    operator intervention (when an operator determines that the server's
    partner is, indeed, down), or as a result of the auto-partner-down
    capability where PARTNER-DOWN state is entered automatically after
    a server has been in COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED state for a pre-determined
    period of time.</t>

      <section anchor="operation-in-partner-down-state" title="Operation in PARTNER-DOWN State">

        <t>The server MUST be responsive in PARTNER-DOWN state, regardess
	if it is primary or secondary.</t>

        <t>It will allow renewal of all outstanding leases on
        addresses or prefixes.  For those resources for which the server is
        using proportional allocation, it will allocate resources
        from its own pool, and after a fixed period of time (the
        MCLT interval) has elapsed from entry into PARTNER-DOWN
        state, it may allocate IP addresses from the set of all
        available pools. Server SHOULD fully deplete its own pool,
	before starting allocations from its downed partner.</t>

        <t>Any resource tagged as available for allocation by the
        other server (at entry to PARTNER-DOWN state) MUST NOT be
        allocated to a new client until the MCLT
        beyond the entry into PARTNER-DOWN state has elapsed.</t>

        <t>A server in PARTNER-DOWN state MUST NOT allocate a resource
        to a DHCP client different from that to which it was
        allocated at the entrance to PARTNER-DOWN state until the
        MCLT beyond the maximum of the following
        times: client expiration time, most recently transmitted
        potential-expiration-time, most recently received ack of
        potential-expiration-time from the partner, and most recently
        acked potential-expiration-time to the partner.  <!-- tomek:
        commented out as don't have section about BNDUPD message yet.
        See section 7.1.5 for details. --> If this time would be earlier
        than the current time plus the maximum-client-lead-time, then
        the time the server entered PARTNER-DOWN state plus the
        maximum-client-lead-time is used.</t>

        <t>The server is not restricted by the MCLT when offering
        lease times while in PARTNER-DOWN state.</t>

        <t>In the unlikely case, when there are two servers operating
        in a PARTNER-DOWN state, there is a chance of duplicate leases
        assigned. This leads to a POTENTIAL-CONFLICT (unresponsive)
        state when they re-establish contact. The duplicate lease
        issue can be postponed to a large extent by the server granting
        new leases first from its own pool. Therefore the server operating
        in PARTNER-DOWN state MUST use its own pool first for new
        leases before assigning any leases from its downed partner pool.

        server in RECOVER state will request an update of missing
        binding information by sending an UPDREQ message.  If the
        server has determined that it has lost its stable storage
        because it has no record of ever having talked to its
        partner, while its partner does have a record of communicating
        with it, it MUST send an UPDREQALL message, otherwise it
        MUST send an UPDREQ message.</t>

        <t>It will wait for an UPDDONE message, and upon receipt
        of that message it will transition to RECOVER-WAIT state.</t>

        <t>If communications fails during the reception of the
        results of the UPDREQ or UPDREQALL message, the server will
        remain in RECOVER state, and will re-issue the UPDREQ or
        UPDREQALL when communications are re-established.</t>

        <t>If an UPDDONE message isn't received within an implementation
        dependent amount of time, and no BNDUPD messages are being
        received, the connection SHOULD be dropped.</t>

      that it has received all outstanding binding update information.
      In the RECOVER-WAIT state the server will wait for the MCLT
      in order to ensure that any processing that this server might

        <t>Upon entry to RECOVER-WAIT state the server MUST start
        a timer whose expiration is set to a time equal to the time
        the server went down (if known) or the time the server
        started (if the down-time is unknown) plus the
        maximum-client-lead-time.  When this timer expires, the
        server will transition into RECOVER-DONE state.</t>

        <t>This is to allow any IP addresses that were allocated
        by this server prior to loss of its client binding information
        in stable storage to contact the other server or to time
        out.</t>

        <t>If this is the first time this server has run failover
        -- as determined by the information received from the
        partner, not necessarily only as determined by this server's
        stable storage (as that may have been lost), then the waiting
        time discussed above may be skipped, and the server MAY
        transition immediately to RECOVER-DONE state.</t>

        <t>If the server has never before run failover, then there
        is no need to wait in this state -- but, again, to determine
        if this server has run failover it is vital that the
        information provided by the partner be utilized, since the
        stable storage of this server may have been lost.</t>

        <t>If communications fails while a server is in RECOVER-WAIT
        state, it has no effect on the operation of this state.
        The server SHOULD continue to operate its timer, and the
        timer expires during the period where communications with
        the other server have failed, then the server SHOULD
        transition to RECOVER-DONE state.  This is rare -- failover
        state transitions are not usually made while communications
        are interrupted, but in this case there is no reason to
        inhibit the timer.</t>

      NORMAL state as is binding database data loss.</t>

        <t hangText="Lease time calculations"> <vspace/>
        As discussed in <xref target="mclt"/>, the
        lease interval given to a DHCP client can never be more than the
        MCLT greater than the most recently received 
	potential-expiration-time from the failover partner or the current time,
        whichever is later.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        As long as a server adheres to this constraint, the specifics of
        the lease interval that it gives to a DHCP client or the value
        of the potential-expiration-time sent to its failover partner
        are implementation dependent.</t>

        <t hangText="Lazy update of partner server"> <vspace/>
        After sending an REPLY that includes lease update to a client,
        the server servicing a DHCP client request attempts to update
        its partner with the new binding information. Server transmits both
        desired valid lifetime and actual valid lifetime.
	<!-- tomek: I think more timestamps than just those two are 
	transmitted -->

        <!-- v4 text: The lease time used in the partner update, a

             the DHCPACK, and the potential-expiration-time MUST be at
             least the lease time, and SHOULD be considerably longer. --></t>

        <t hangText="Reallocation of resources between clients"> <vspace/>

        Whenever a client binding is released or expires, a BNDUPD
        message must be sent to the partner, setting the binding
        state to RELEASED or EXPIRED.  However, until a BNDACK is
        received for this message, the resource cannot be allocated
        to another client.  It cannot be allocated to the same client
        again if a BNDUPD was sent, otherwise it can. See <xref
        target="reallocation"/> for details.
        </t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>In NORMAL state, each server receives binding updates from
      its partner server in BNDUPD messages. It records these in its
      client binding database in stable storage and then sends a
      corresponding BNDACK message to its partner server.</t>

        into PARTNER- DOWN state.  Generally, this would be an unusual
        situation, where some external agency knew the partner server
        was down.  Using the command in this case would be appropriate
        if the polling interval and timeout were long.</t>
        <!-- Does it make sense? That is at least strange - server maintain

        <t>If a server in NORMAL state fails to receive acks to messages sent to
        its partner for an implementation dependent period of time, it MAY
        move into COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED state.  This situation might
        occur if the partner server was capable of maintaining the TCP con-
        nection between the server and also capable of sending a CONTACT mes-
        sage periodically, but was (for some reason) incapable of pro-
        cessing BNDUPD messages.</t>

        <t>If a server in NORMAL state receives any messages from its partner

        COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED state and take the appropriate state tran-
        sition from there.  For example, it would be expected for the partner
        to transition from POTENTIAL-CONFLICT into NORMAL state, but not for
        the partner to transition from NORMAL into POTENTIAL-CONFLICT state.</t>

      <t>A server goes into COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED state whenever it is
      unable to communicate with its partner. Primary and secondary
      servers cycle automatically (without administrative intervention)
      between NORMAL and COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED state as the network
      connection between them fails and recovers, or as the partner server
      cycles between operational and non-operational.  No duplicate resource
      allocation can occur while the servers cycle between these
      states.</t>

      <t>When a server enters COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED state, if it has been
      configured to support an automatic transition out of COMMUNICATIONS-
      INTERRUPTED state and into PARTNER-DOWN state (i.e., a "safe period"
      has been configured, see section TODO), then a timer MUST be started
      for the length of the configured safe period.</t>
      <!-- tomek: Issue 15: do we want auto-partner-down timer? -->

      <t>A server transitioning into the COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED
      state from the NORMAL state SHOULD raise some alarm condition to
      alert administrative staff to a potential problem in the DHCP
      subsystem.</t>

      <section anchor="operation-in-comm-interrupted-state"
               title="Operation in COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED State">

        <t>In this state a server MUST respond to all DHCP client
        requests.  When allocating new leases, each server allocates
        from its own pool, where the primary MUST allocate only FREE
        resources (addresses or prefixes), and the secondary MUST
        allocate only FREE_BACKUP resources (addresses or prefixes).  When
        responding to RENEW messages, each server will allow continued
        renewal of a DHCP client's current lease on an IP address or
        prefix irrespective of whether that lease was given out by the
        receiving server or not, although the renewal period MUST NOT
        exceed the maximum client lead time (MCLT) beyond the latest
        of: 1) the potential valid lifetime already acknowledged by
        the other server, or 2) the actual valid lifetime sent to the
	DHCPv6 client, or 3) the potential valid lifetime received from
        the partner server.</t>

        <t>However, since the server cannot communicate with its
        partner in this state, the acknowledged potential valid
        lifetime will not be updated in any new bindings.  This is
        likely to eventually cause the actual valid lifetimes to be
        the current time plus the MCLT (unless this is greater than
        the desired-client-lease-time).</t>

      Yes, we did:  Tomek said this in some email on Sept 7, 2012:

	I'd like to comment on some decisions made regarding load
	balancing, before someone raises it again. v4 failover
	standardization failed, because the draft was too large and
	there was nobody willing to review it. That's why we try
	to succeed with v6 failover by splitting it to smaller
	chunks. That's why this failover covers the absolute minimum,
	i.e. active-passive only with load balancing being out of
	scope. You may notice that some of the states (RECOVER-DONE
	and CONFLICT-DONE) are really useful only for load balancing.
	We decided to keep them in to make extension to LB much
	simpler - the state machine will be operating in the same
	manner with and without LB. Obviously, there are many folks
	interested in load balancing. We are, too, but we want it
	to be an extension, defined in separate draft.
      
      Tomek: Ok, I've changed the wording slightly to not explicitly
      say that server does load balancing, as it is not officially

      provide load balancing. It wouldn't do much good on its own, as
      one (faster) server could be chosen more frequently (assuming
      that with equal preference sets clients will pick first
      responding server, which is not mandated by DHCPv6).  We could
      design a simple mechanism of dynamically updating preference
      depending on usage of available resources. This concept hasn't
      been investigated in detail yet.</t> -->

  <section anchor="DDNS" title="Dynamic DNS Considerations">

    <t>DHCP servers (and clients) can use DNS Dynamic Updates as
    described in <xref target="RFC2136">RFC 2136</xref> to maintain
    DNS name-mappings as they maintain DHCP leases.  Many different
    administrative models for DHCP-DNS integration are possible.
    Descriptions of several of these models, and guidelines that
    DHCP servers and clients should follow in carrying them out,
    are laid out in <xref target="RFC4704">RFC 4704</xref>.</t>

    <t>The nature of the failover protocol introduces some issues
    concerning dynamic DNS updates that are not part of non-failover
    environments.  This section describes these issues, and defines
    the information which failover partners should exchange in order
    to ensure consistent behavior.  The presence of this section
    should not be interpreted as requiring an implementation of
    the DHCPv6 failover protocol to also support DDNS updates.</t>

    <t>The purpose of this discussion is to clarify the areas where
    the failover and DHCP-DDNS protocols intersect for the benefit
    of implementations which support both protocols, not to introduce
    a new requirement into the DHCPv6 failover protocol.  Thus, a
    DHCPv6 server which implements the failover protocol MAY also
    support dynamic DNS updates, but if it does support dynamic DNS
    updates it SHOULD utilize the techniques described here in order
    to correctly distribute them between the failover partners.
    See <xref target="RFC4704">RFC 4704</xref> as well as <xref
    target="RFC4703">RFC 4703</xref> for information on how DHCPv6
    servers deal with potential conflicts when updating DNS even
    without failover.</t>

    <t>From the standpoint of the failover protocol, there is no
    reason why a server which is utilizing the DDNS protocol to
    update a DNS server should not be a partner with a server which
    is not utilizing the DDNS protocol to update a DNS server.
    However, a server which is not able to support DDNS or is not
    configured to support DDNS SHOULD output a warning message when
    it receives BNDUPD messages which indicate that its failover
    partner is configured to support the DDNS protocol to update a
    DNS server.  An implementation MAY consider this an error and
    refuse to operate, or it MAY choose to operate anyway, having
    warned the user of the problem in some way.</t>

    <section anchor="failover-ddns"
       title="Relationship between failover and dynamic DNS update">

	<t>The failover protocol describes the conditions under
	which each failover server may renew a lease to its current
	DHCP client, and describes the conditions under which it
	may grant a lease to a new DHCP client.  An analogous set
	of conditions determines when a failover server should
	initiate a DDNS update, and when it should attempt to remove
	records from the DNS. The failover protocol's conditions
	are based on the desired external behavior: avoiding duplicate
	address and prefix assignments; allowing clients to continue
	using leases which they obtained from one failover partner
	even if they can only communicate with the other partner;
	allowing the secondary DHCP server to grant new leases even
	if it is unable to communicate with the primary server.
	The desired external DDNS behavior for DHCP failover servers
	is similar to that described above for the failover protocol
	itself:</t>

	<t><list style="numbers">
	    <t>Allow timely DDNS updates from the server which
	    grants a lease to a client. Recognize that there is
	    often a DDNS update lifecycle which parallels the DHCP
	    lease lifecycle. This is likely to include the addition
	    of records when the lease is granted, and the removal
	    of DNS records when the leased resource is subsequently
	    made available for allocation to a different client.</t>

	    <t>Communicate enough information between the two
	    failover servers to allow one to complete the DDNS
	    update 'lifecycle' even if the other server originally
	    granted the lease.</t>

	    <t>Avoid redundant or overlapping DDNS updates, where
	    both failover servers are attempting to perform DDNS
	    updates for the same lease-client binding.</t>
	    
	    <t>Avoid situations where one partner is attempting to
	    add RRs related to a lease binding while the other
	    partner is attempting to remove RRs related to the same
	    lease binding.</t>
	</list></t>

	<t>While DHCP servers configured for DDNS typically perform
	these operations on both the AAAA and the PTR resource records, 
	this is not required.  It is entirely possible that a DHCP server
	could be configured to only update the DNS with PTR records, and 
	the DHCPv6 clients could be responsible for updating the DNS with
	their own AAAA records.  In this case, the discussions here would
	apply only to the PTR records.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="useofddns" 
       title="Exchanging DDNS Information">

	<t>In order for either server to be able to complete a DDNS
	update, or to remove DNS records which were added by its
	partner, both servers need to know the FQDN associated with
	the lease-client binding.  In addition, to properly handle
	DDNS updates, additional information is required.  All of
	the following information needs to be transmitted between
	the failover partners:</t>

	<t><list style="numbers">
	    <t>The FQDN that the client requested be associated
	    with the resource.  If the client doesn't request a
	    particular FQDN and one is synthesized by the failover
	    server or if the failover server is configured to replace
	    a client requested FQDN with a different FQDN, then
	    the server generated value would be used. </t>

	    <t>The FQDN that was actually placed in the DNS for
	    this lease. It may differ from the client requested
	    FQDN due to some form of disambiguation or other DHCP
	    server configuration (as described above).</t>
	    
	    <t>The status of and DDNS operations in progress or
	    completed.</t>

	    <t>Information sufficient to allow the failover partner
	    to remove the FQDN from the DNS should that become
	    necessary.</t>
	</list></t>

	<t>These data items are the minimum necessary set to reliably
	allow two failover partners to successfully share the
	responsibility to keep the DNS up to date with the resources
	allocated to clients.</t>

	<t>This information would typically be included in BNDUPD
	messages sent from one failover partner to the other.
	Failover servers MAY choose not to include this information
	in BNDUPD messages if there has been no change in the status
	of any DDNS update related to the lease.</t>

	<t>The partner server receiving BNDUPD messages containing
	the DDNS information SHOULD compare the status informatin
	and the FQDN with the current DDNS information it has
	associated with the lease binding, and update its notion
	of the DDNS status accordingly.</t>

	<t>Some implementations will instead choose to send a BNDUPD
	without waiting for the DDNS update to complete, and then
	will send a second BNDUPD once the DDNS update is complete.
	Other implementations will delay sending the partner a
	BNDUPD until the DDNS update has been acknowledged by the
	DNS server, or until some time-limit has elapsed, in order
	to avoid sending a second BNDUPD.</t>

	<t>The FQDN option contains the FQDN that will be associated
	with the AAAA RR (if the server is performing an AAAA RR update
	for the client).  The PTR RR can be generated automatically from
	the IP address or prefix value. The FQDN may be composed
	in any of several ways, depending on server configuration
	and the information provided by the client in its DHCP
	messages. The client may supply a hostname which it would
	like the server to use in forming the FQDN, or it may supply
	the entire FQDN. The server may be configured to attempt
	to use the information the client supplies, it may be
	configured with an FQDN to use for the client, or it may
	be configured to synthesize an FQDN.</t>

	<t>Since the server interacting with the client may not have completed the
	DDNS update at the time it sends the first BNDUPD about the
	lease binding, there may be cases where the FQDN in later
	BNDUPD messages does not match the FQDN included in earlier
	messages.  For example, the responsive server may be
	configured to handle situations where two or more DHCP
	client FQDNs are identical by modifying the most-specific
	label in the FQDNs of some of the clients in an attempt to
	generate unique FQDNs for them (a process sometimes called
	"disambiguation").  Alternatively, at sites which use some
	or all of the information which clients supply to form the
	FQDN, it's possible that a client's configuration may be
	changed so that it begins to supply new data.  The 
	server interacting with the client may react by removing the DNS records which it
	originally added for the client, and replacing them with
	records that refer to the client's new FQDN. In such cases,
	the server SHOULD include the actual FQDN that
	was used in subsequent DDNS options in any BNDUPD messages exchanged between
	the failover partners.  This server
	SHOULD include relevant information in its BNDUPD messages.
	This information may be necessary in order to allow the
	non-responsive partner to detect client configuration changes
	that change the hostname or FQDN data which the client
	includes in its DHCP requests.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="addingrr" 
       title="Adding RRs to the DNS">

	<t>A failover server which is going to perform DDNS updates
	SHOULD initiate the DDNS update when it grants a new lease
	to a client. The server which did not grant the lease SHOULD NOT
	initiate
	a DDNS update when it receives the BNDUPD after the lease
	has been granted. The failover protocol ensures that only
	one of the partners will grant a lease to any individual
	client, so it follows that this requirement will prevent
	both partners from initiating updates simultaneously. The
	server initiating the update SHOULD follow the protocol in
	<xref target="RFC4704">RFC 4704</xref>.  The server may be
	configured to perform a AAAA RR update on behalf of its
	clients, or not. Ordinarily, a failover server will not
	initiate DDNS updates when it renews leases. In two cases,
	however, a failover server MAY initiate a DDNS update when
	it renews a lease to its existing client:</t>

	<t><list style="numbers">

	    is the server which should initiate the DDNS update.</t>

	    <t>If a server is in PARTNER-DOWN state, it can conclude
	    that its partner is no longer attempting to perform an
	    update for the existing client. If the remaining server
	    has not recorded that an update for the binding has
	    been successfully completed, the server MAY initiate a
	    DDNS update.  It MAY initiate this update immediately
	    upon entry to PARTNER-DOWN state, it may perform this
	    in the background, or it MAY initiate this update upon
	    next hearing from the DHCP client.</t>

    <section anchor="deletingrr" 
       title="Deleting RRs from the DNS">

	<t>The failover server which makes a resource FREE SHOULD
	initiate any DDNS deletes, if it has recorded that DNS
	records were added on behalf of the client.</t>

	<t>A server not in PARTNER-DOWN state "makes a resource
	FREE" when it initiates a BNDUPD with a binding-status of
	FREE, FREE_BACKUP, EXPIRED, or RELEASED.  Its partner
	confirms this status by acking that BNDUPD, and upon receipt
	of the BNDACK the server has "made the resource FREE".

	<t>It is at this point that it should initiate the DDNS

	of FREE, EXPIRED, or RELEASED previously, but the other
	server will have rejected these BNDUPD messages.</t>

	<t>The failover protocol ensures that only one of the two
	partner servers will be able to make a resource FREE. The
	server making the resource FREE may be doing so while it
	is in NORMAL communication with its partner, or it may be
	in PARTNER-DOWN state. If a server is in PARTNER-DOWN state,
	it may be performing DDNS deletes for RRs which its partner
	added originally. This allows a single remaining partner
	server to assume responsibility for all of the DDNS activity
	which the two servers were undertaking.</t>

	<t>Another implication of this approach is that no DDNS RR
	deletes will be performed while either server is in
	COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED state, since no resource are
	moved into the FREE state during that period.</t>

    <!-- issue 10 
    TODO: Describe how lease reservation works with failover. See
    Section 5.13 in <xref target="dhcpv4-failover"/>.

    Done 10/16/12 Kim
    -->

    <t>Some DHCP servers support a capability to offer specific preconfigured 
    resources to DHCP clients.  These are real DHCP
    clients, they do the entire DHCP protocol, but these servers always
    offer the client a specific pre-configured resource, one they
    offer that resource to no other clients.  Such a capability has
    several names, but it is sometimes called a "reservation", in that
    the resource is reserved for a particular DHCP client.</t>

    <t>In a situation where there are two DHCP servers serving the same subnet 
    without using failover, the two DHCP server's need to have disjoint 
    resource pools, but identical reservations for the DHCP
    clients.</t>

    <t>In a failover context, both servers need to be configured
    with the proper reservations in an identical manner, but if we
    stop there problems can occur around the edge conditions where
    reservations are made for resource that has already been leased
    to a different client.  Different servers handle this conflict
    in different ways, but the goal of the failover protocol is to
    allow correct operation with any server's approach to the normal
    processing of the DHCP protocol.</t>

    <t>The general solution with regards to reservations is as follows.
    Whenever a reserved resource becomes FREE (i.e., when first configured 
    or whenever a client frees it or it expires or is reset), the
    primary server MUST show that resource as FREE (and thus available
    for its own allocation) and it MUST send it to the secondary server
    in a BNDUPD with a flag set showing that it is reserved and with a
    status of BACKUP.</t>

    <t>Note that this implies that a reserved resource goes through
    the normal state changes from FREE to ACTIVE (and possibly back
    to FREE).  The failover protocol supports this approach to
    reservations, i.e., where the resource undergoes the normal
    state changes of any resource, but it can only be offered to
    the client for which it is reserved.</t>

    <t>From the above, it follows that a reservation soley on the
    secondary will not necessarily allow the secondary to offer
    that address to client to whom it is reserved.  The reservation
    must also appear on the primary as well for the secondary to
    be able to offer the resource to the client to which is is
    reserved.</t>

    <t>When the reservation on a resource is cancelled, if the resource 
    is currently FREE and the server is the primary, or BACKUP and the
    server is the secondary, the server MUST send a BNDUPD to the other
    server with the binding-status FREE and an indication that the
    resource is no longer reserved.</t>

    TODO: Should we try to pin down the form of "indication that
    the resource is (or is not) reserved"?

  <section title="Security Considerations">
    <t>DHCPv6 failover is an extension of a standard DHCPv6 protocol, so all
    security considerations from <xref target="RFC3315" />, Section 23 and
    <xref target="RFC3633" />, Section 15 related to the server apply.</t>

    <t>As traffic exchange between clients and server is not encrypted,
    an attacker than penetrated the network and is able to intercept traffic,
    will not gain any additional information by also sniffing communication
    between partners.</t>

    <t>An attacker that is able to impersonate one partner can efficiently
    perform a denial of service attack on the remaining uncompromised server.
    Several techniques may be used: pretending that conflict resolution
    is required, requesting rebalance, claming that a valid lease was released
    or declined etc. For that reason the communication between servers
    SHOULD support failover connections over TLS, as explained in Section
    <xref target="create-connections" />. Such secure connection SHOULD
    be optional and configurable by the administrator.</t>

    <t>A server MUST NOT operate in PARTNER-DOWN if its partner is up.
    Network administrator is expected to switch remaining active server
    to PARTNER-DOWN state only if he or she is sure that the other server
    is indeed down. Failing to obey this requirement will result in both
    servers likely assigning duplicate leases to different clients. Implementors
    should take that into consideration if they decide to implement
    timer-based transition to PARTNER-DOWN state.</t>

    <t>Running a network protected by DHCPv6 failover requires more resources
    than running without it. In particular some of the resources are
    allocated to the secondary server and they are not usable in a normal
    (i.e. non failures) operation. While limiting this pool may be preferable
    from resource utilisation perspective, it must be reasonably large pool,
    so the secondary may take over once primary becomes unavailable.</t>

    and will be transformed into consistent text once the core design
    solidifies.</t>

    <keyword>DHCPv6 Relay, DHCPv6 option</keyword>

    <abstract>
      <t>DHCPv6 relay agents can not communicate with DHCPv6 clients directly.
      However, in some cases, the relay agent possesses some information that
      would be useful to the DHCPv6 client. This document describes a
      mechanism whereby the DHCPv6 relay agent can provide such information to
      the DHCPv6 server, which can, in turn, pass this information on to the
      DHCP client.</t>

      <t>This document updates RFC3315 (DHCPv6) by making explicit the
      implicit requirement that relay agents not modify the content of
      encapsulation payloads as they are relayed back toward clients.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The DHCPv6 specification <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> allows DHCP
      relay agents to forward DHCPv6 messages between clients and servers that
      are not on the same IPv6 link. In some cases the DHCP relay agent has
      information not available to the DHCP server that would be useful to
      provide to a DHCP client. For example, the DHCP client may need to learn
      the EAP local domain name <xref
      target="I.D-ietf-hokey-ldn-discovery"></xref> for use in EAP
      re-authentication <xref target="RFC5296"></xref>, which is known to the
      relay agent but not the server.</t>

      <t>The DHCPv6 protocol specification does not provide a mechanism
      whereby the relay agent can provide options to the client. This document
      extends DHCP with a mechanism that allows DHCP relay agents to propose
      options for the server to send to DHCP clients.</t>

      <t>This document is not intended to provide a general mechanism for
      storing client configuration information in the relay agent. Rather, it
      is intended to address specific use cases where only the relay agent has
      information needed by the client. This extension is not applicable to
      DHCP options in general, but rather provided as a mechanism for new
      specifications that require this functionality.</t>

    <section title="Protocol Summary">
      <t>DHCP clients do not support a mechanism for receiving options from
      relay agents--the relay agent is required to deliver the payload from
      the DHCP server to the DHCP client without changing it. In order for the
      DHCP relay agent to provide options to the client, it sends those
      options to the DHCP server, encapsulated in a Relay-Supplied Options
      option. The DHCP server can then choose to place those options in the
      response it sends to the client.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Encoding">
      <t>In order to supply options for the DHCP server to send to the client,
      the relay agent sends a Relay-Supplied Options option in the Relay-
      Forward message. This option encapsulates whatever options the relay
      agent wishes to provide to the DHCPv6 server.</t>

    <section title="RSOO-enabled options">
      <t>The RSOO MUST NOT contain any option that is not specifically called
      out as an RSOO-enabled option. Specifications that describe RSOO-enabled
      options MUST reference this specification, and MUST state that the
      option they define is RSOO-enabled. No DHCP option specified prior to
      the issuance of this specification is RSOO-enabled.</t>

      <t>A current list of RSOO-enabled options can be found in the list
      titled "Options Permitted in the Relay-Supplied Options option"
      maintained at http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters.</t>

      <t>DHCP option specifications that define RSOO-enabled options MUST add
      text similar to the following to their IANA considerations section;
      "random relay option" should be replaced with the name of the option
      being defined in the specification: <list>
          <t>We request that IANA add the name "random relay option" to the
          registry titled "Options Permitted in the Relay-Supplied Options
          Option" maintained at
          http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="DHCP Relay Agent Behavior">
      <t>Relay agents MAY include a Relay-Supplied Options option in the
      option payload of a Relay-Forward message being sent toward a DHCP
      server. When relaying the payload of Relay-Reply messages toward
      clients, Relay agents MUST NOT modify the payload.</t>

      <t>Relay agents MUST NOT send non-RSOO-enabled options in the Relay-
      Supplied Options option.</t>

      <t>In order to allow network administrators to control the flow of RSOO
      options onto the network, relay agents that implement the Relay Supplied
      Options Option need to have a configuration parameter that determines to
      whether or not they will relay RSOO-containing Relay-Forward
      messages.</t>

      <t>Relay agents that have this configuration parameter and that are
      configured to disable forwarding of Relay-Forward messages that contain
      a Relay-Supplied Options option MUST silently discard any such
      message.</t>

      <t>Implementations that can be configured in this way MUST examine all
      Relay-Forward encapsulations, not just the outer encapsulation.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="DHCP Server Behavior">
      <t>DHCP servers that implement Relay-Supplied DHCP Options MUST examine
      each option contained in an RSOO to see if it is an RSOO-enabled option.
      DHCP servers MUST silently discard any option contained in an RSOO that
      is not RSOO-enabled. DHCP server implementations SHOULD have an
      administrator-configurable list of RSOO-enabled options, so that new
      RSOO-enabled options do not require software to be updated.</t>

      <t>DHCP servers normally construct a list of options that are candidates
      to send to the DHCP client, and then construct the DHCP packet according
      to section 17.2.2 of <xref target="RFC3315"> DHCPv6</xref>.</t>

      <t>If the server implementing Relay-Supplied DHCP Options receives an
      RSOO, it SHOULD add any options that appear in the RSOO for which it has
      no internal candidate to the list of options that are candidates to send
      to the DHCP client. The server SHOULD discard any options that appear in
      the RSOO for which it already has one or more candidates.</t>

      <t>Aside from the addition of options from the RSOO, the DHCP server
      should then construct a DHCP packet as it normally would, and transmit
      it to the DHCP client as described in DHCPv6 <xref
      target="RFC3315"></xref>.</t>

      <t>DHCP servers may receive multiply-nested Relay-Forward messages
      containing conflicting values for options contained in Relay Supplied
      Options options in these messages.</t>

      <t>When such a conflict exists, the DHCP server MUST choose no more than
      one of these options to forward to the client. The DHCP server MUST NOT
      forward more than one of these options to the client.</t>

      <t>By default, the DHCP server MUST choose the innermost value--the
      value supplied by the relay agent closest to the DHCP client, to forward
      to the DHCP client.</t>

      <t>DHCP server implementations MAY provide other heuristics for choosing
      which one of a set of such conflicting options to forward to the client,
      as long as the specified behavior is the default behavior.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document provides a mechanism whereby a relay agent can inject
      options into the response the DHCP server sends to the DHCP client. In
      general it is expected that RSOO-enabled options will be specified
      because they only make sense when originating from the relay agent. This
      is true of existing use cases.</t>

      <t>In the event that some new RSOO-enabled option is specified that can
      originate from either the server or the relay agent, this should be
      addressed in the security considerations section of the document that
      specifies the use of that option.</t>

      <t>In some environments, there is an interface on one side of which is
      the client, and zero or more routers, and on the other side of which is
      a network managed by a monolithic or effectively monolithic
      administrative entity. Nodes and routers on the client side of the
      interface are not controlled by this entity, and are considered
      "untrusted." Nodes and routers on the network side of this interface are
      considered trusted.</t>

      <t>It is possible for a malicious node acting as a relay agent on the
      untrusted side of this interface to supply a Relay-Supplied Options
      option containing one or more RSOO-enabled options that would override
      the same option or options that were provided by a relay agent on the
      trusted side of the interface.</t>

      <t>In environments where this is a possibility, network administrators
      are advised to use relay agents that are capable of dropping Relay-
      Forward messages containing the Relay-Supplied Options option, and are
      advised to configure those relays to drop such messages.</t>

      <t>Note, however, that this will only be effective if the message from
      the DHCP server to the DHCP client is authenticated as specified in
      Section 21 of DHCP Version 6 <xref target="RFC3315"></xref>, or using
      some similar mechanism. Without this authentication, the malicious node
      on the untrusted portion of the network can simply modify the DHCP
      server's response in transit back to the DHCP client, and there is no
      way for the client to detect that this has happened.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is requested to assign one new DHCPv6 option code from the
      registry of DHCP Option Codes maintained at
      http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters. The option code
      OPTION_RSOO will be assigned to the Relay-Supplied Options option.</t>

      <t>IANA is also requested to create a new registry on the same
      assignments page, titled "Options Permitted in the Relay-Supplied
      Options Option". This registry will contain a list of DHCPv6 option
      codes from the DHCP Option Codes list at
      http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters as suboptions of the
      Relay-Supplied Options option. Currently, the list is empty. Options may
      be added to this list after IETF Review<xref
      target="RFC5226"></xref>.</t>

      <t>IETF Review should include careful consideration of the security
      implications of allowing a relay agent to provide a value for the option
      being considered for addition to this registry. In the case where an
      IETF working group chartered to review DHCP protocol extensions exists,
      it is not sufficient for some other working group to review the registry
      addition.</t>

            <t>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a generic

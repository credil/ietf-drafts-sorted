   <t>
    Routed protocols are often susceptible to spoof attacks.  The
    canonical solution for IPv6 is Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND), 
    a solution that is non-trivial to deploy.  This document
    proposes a light-weight alternative and complement to SEND based on
    filtering in the layer-2 network fabric, using a variety of filtering
    criteria, including, for example, SEND status.

<section title="Introduction">
  
  <t>When operating IPv6 in a shared L2 network segment without complete
   SEND support by all devices connected or without the availability 
   of the infrastructure necessary to support Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) <xref target="RFC3971" />, there is always 
   the risk of facing operational problems due to rogue Router 
   Advertisements generated maliciously or unintentionally by 
   unauthorized or improperly configured routers connecting to the 
   segment. 
   </t>

   <t>There are several examples of work done on this topic which resulted
   in several related studies <xref target="reference1" />
   <xref target="reference2" /> <xref target="reference3" />.This document describes a 
   solution framework for the rogue-RA problem where network segments
   are designed around a single or a set of L2-switching devices 
   capable of identifying invalid RAs and blocking them. The solutions 
   developed within this framework can span the spectrum from basic 
   (where the port of the L2 device is statically instructed to forward
   or not to forward RAs received from the connected device) to advanced
   (where a criteria is used by the L2 device to dynamically validate 
   or invalidate a received RA, this criteria can even be based on SEND
   mechanisms).
   </t>

</section>


<section title="Model and Applicability">

  <t>RA-Guard applies to an environment where all messages
  between IPv6 end-devices traverse the controlled L2 networking
  devices. It does not apply to a shared media, when devices can 
  communicate directly without going through an RA-Guard capable 
  L2 networking device.

<t>RA-Guard does not intend to provide a substitute for SEND based
  solutions.  It actually intends to provide complementary solutions
  in those environments where SEND might not be suitable or fully supported
  by all devices involved. It may take time until SEND is ubiquitous in IPv6
  networks and some of its large scale deployment aspects are sorted out
  such as provisioning hosts with trust anchors. It is also reasonable 
  to expect that some devices might not consider implementing SEND at 
  all such as IPv6 enabled sensors. An RA-Guard implementation which SEND-validates RAs
  on behalf of hosts would potentially simplify some of these challenges.
</t>

 <t>RA-Guard can be seen as a superset of SEND with regard to router
   authorization. Its purpose is to filter Router Advertisements based on
   a set of criteria, from a simplistic "RA disallowed on a given
   interface" to "RA allowed from pre-defined sources" and up to full fledge SEND
   "RA allowed from authorized sources only".
 </t>
 <t>In addition to this granularity on the criteria for filtering out
   Router Advertisements, RA-Guard introduces the concept of router
   authorization proxy. Instead of each node on the link analyzing
   RAs and making an individual decision, a legitimate
   node-in-the-middle performs the analysis on behalf of all other
   nodes on the link. The analysis itself is not different
   from what each node would do: if SEND is enabled, the RA is checked
   against X.509 certificates <xref target="RFC4861" />. If any other criteria is in use,
   such as known L3 (addresses) or L2 (link-layer address, port number)
   legitimate sources of RAs, the node-in-the middle can use this
   criteria and filter out any RA that does not comply. If this
   node-in-the-middle is a L2 device, it will not change the content of
   the validated RA, and avoid any of the ND-proxy pitfalls. 
 </t>
 <t>RA-Guard intends to provide simple solutions to the rogue-RA
   problem in contexts where simplicity is required while leveraging
   SEND in an context environment consisting of with a mix of SEND capable devices (L2 switches and
   routers) and devices that do not consistently use SEND. Furthermore,
   RA-Guard is useful to simplify SEND deployments, as only the L2
   switch and the routers are required to carry certificates (their
   own and the trust anchor certificates).   
 </t>
</section>

 <section title="Stateless RA-Guard">
   <t>Stateless RA-Guard examines incoming RAs and decide whether to forward
     or block them based solely on information found in the message or in
     the L2-device configuration. Typical information available in the
     frames received, useful for RA validation is:
     <vspace blankLines="1" /> 
     <list style="symbols">
       <t>Link-layer address of the sender</t>
       <t>Port on which the frame was received</t>
       <t>IP source address</t>
       <t>Prefix list</t>
     </list>
   </t>
   <t>The following configuration information created on the L2-device
     can be  made available to RA-Guard, to validate against the
     information found in the received RA frame:
     <vspace blankLines="1" /> 
     <list style="symbols">
       <t>Allowed/Disallowed link-layer address of RA-sender</t>
       <t>Allowed/Disallowed ports for receiving RAs</t>
       <t>Allowed/Disallowed IP source addresses of RA-sender</t>
       <t>Allowed Prefix list and Prefix ranges</t>
       <t>Router Priority</t>
     </list>
   </t>
   <t>Once the L2 device has validated the content of the RA frame against the
     configuration, it forwards the RA to destination, whether
     unicast or multicast. Otherwise, the RA is dropped.
   </t>

   <t>An example of a very simple stateless RA-Guard implementation could be a 
   small L2-switch for which there is one interface "statically-configured" as the interface 
   connecting to a router, while all other interfaces are for non-router devices.
   With his small static setup the only interface forwarding RAs will be the pre-assigned 
   router interface, while the non-router interfaces block all RAs.
   </t>

 </section>

 <section title="Stateful RA-Guard">
   <section title="State Machine">
   <t>Stateful RA-Guard learns dynamically about legitimate RA senders,
     and store this information for allowing subsequent RAs. A simple
     stateful scheme would be for the L2-device to listen to RAs during
     a certain manual determined period of time, where the start of the 
     listening-period and the duration of the listening-period for 
     a single instance is controled by the manual intervention. 
     As result the L2-device can then allow subsequent RAs only on
     those ports on which valid RAs were received during this period. 
     Often the LEARNING state will only be activated by manual configuration 
     when a new IPv6 router is provisioned on the L2-network.
     </t>

     <t>
     A more
     sophisticated stateful scheme is based on SEND, and is described in
     <xref target="send-based-ra-guard"/>.
   </t>
   <t>The state machine  for stateful RA-Guard can be global,
   per-interface, or per-peer, depending on the scheme used for
   authorizing RAs. 
   </t>
   <t>
     When RA-Guard is SEND-based, the state machine is
     per-peer and defined in [RFC3971].
   </t>      
   <t>When RA-Guard is using a discovery method, the state-machine
     of the RA-Guard capability consists of four different states:
     <vspace blankLines="1" /> 
     <list style="symbols">
       <t>State 1: OFF
	 <list style="empty">
	   <t>A device or interface in RA-Guard "OFF" state, operates as if the RA-Guard 
	     capability is not available. 
	   </t>
	 </list>
       </t>
     
       <t>State 2: LEARNING
	 <list style="empty">
	   <t>
             A device or interface in the RA-Guard "Learning" state is actively 
             acquiring information about the IPv6 routing devices connected. 
             The learning process takes place over a pre-defined 
             unique period in time, set by manual configuration or it can be event triggered. 
             The information gathered is compared against pre-defined criteria; 
             criteria similar as the stateless RA-Guard rules to qualify the validity of the RAs.
 	   </t>

           <t>
             In this state, the RA-Guard enabled device or interface is either 
             blocking "all" RAs until their validity is verified or, alternatively 
             it can temporarily forward "all" the RAs until their validity is verified.
           </t>

           <t>
             Once the L2-device has identified through "Learning" the valid IPv6 
             routers and hence also identified the valid RAs, it transtions each 
             interface from "LEARNING" into either BLOCKING state if there 
             was no valid IPv6 router discovered at the interface, or transitions 
             the interface into FORWARDING state if there was a valid IPv6 router discovered.
           </t>


	 </list>
       </t>

       <t>State 3: BLOCKING
	 <list style="empty">
	   <t>A device or interface running RA-Guard and in Blocking state will block ingress
	     RA-messages.
	   </t>

	   <t>
             An interface can transition from BLOCKING state into FORWARDING state directly if 
             explicitly instructed by the L2-device operator.
	   </t>

	   <t>
             An interface can transition from BLOCKING state into LEARNING state if either 
             explicitly told by the L2-device operator or by a triggered event.
	   </t>


	 </list>
       </t>
     
       <t>State 4: FORWARDING
	 <list style="empty">
	   <t>A device or interface running RA-Guard and in Forwarding
	     state will accept valid ingress RAs and forward them to their destination.
	   </t>

	   <t>
             An interface can transition from FORWARDING state into BLOCKING state directly if 
             explicitly instructed by the L2-device operator.
	   </t>

	   <t>
             An interface can transition from FORWARDING state into LEARNING state if either 
             explicitly told by the L2-device operator or by a triggered event.
	   </t>

	 </list>
       </t>

     </list>
   </t>
   <t>The transition between these states can be triggered by manual configuration or 
     by meeting a pre-defined criteria.
   </t>
   </section>


<section anchor="send-based-ra-guard" title="SEND-based RA-Guard">
<t>In this scenario, the L2 device is blocking or forwarding RAs based
  on SEND considerations. Upon capturing an RA on the interface, the
  L2-device will first verify the Cryptographically Generated 
  Addresses (CGA) <xref target="RFC3971" /> address and the RSA (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman 
  algorithm for public-key cryptography) signature, as
  specified in section 5 of <xref target="RFC3971" />.  RA should be dropped in case
  of failure of this verification. It will then apply host behavior as
  described in section 6.4.6 of <xref target="RFC3971" />. In particular, the L2
  device will attempt to retrieve a valid certificate from its cache
  for the public key referred to in the RA. If such certificate is
  found, the L2 device will forward the RA to destination. If not, the
  L2 device will generate a Certification Path Solicitation (CPS) <xref target="RFC3971" />, 
  sourced with UNSPECIFIED address, to
  query the router certificate(s). It will then capture the Certification Path Advertisements (CPA) <xref target="RFC3971" />,
  and attempt to validate the certificate chain. Failure to validate
  the chain will result in dropping the RA. Upon validation success,
  the L2 device will forward the RA to destination and and store the
  router certificate in its cache.
</t>
<t>In order to operate in this scenario, the L2-device should be
  provisioned with a trust anchor certificate, as specified in
  section 6 of [RFC3971]. It may also establish a layer-3 connectivity
  with a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Certification Path Advertisement server and/or with and 
  NTP server. Bootstrapping issue in
  this case can be resolved by using the configuration method to
  specify a trusted port to a first router, and SEND-based RA-Guard
  method on all other ports. The first router can then be used for
  Network Time Protocol (NTP) <xref target="RFC5905" /> and CRL connectivity.
</t>

<section title="RA-Guard Use Considerations">

  <t>The RA-Guard mechanism is effective only when all messages
   between IPv6 devices in the target environment traverse
   controlled L2 networking devices. In the case of environments such as
   Ethernet hubs, devices can communicate directly without going through
   an RA-Guard capable L2 networking device, the RA-Guard 
   feature cannot protect against rogue-RAs.
  </t>

  <t>RA-Guard mechanisms do not offer protection in environments 
  where IPv6 traffic is tunneled.
  </t>

</section>


<section title="IANA Considerations">


   <t>There are no extra IANA consideration for this document.
   </t>

</section>


<section title="Security Considerations">

   
   <t>Once RA-Guard has setup the proper criteria, for example, it identified 
   that a port is allowed to receive RAs, or it identified legitimate sources 
   of RA, or certificate base <xref target="RFC4861" />, then there is no possible instances of 
   accidently filtered legitimate Router advertisements assuming the RA-Guard 
   filter enforcement follows strictly the RA-Guard set criteria. 
   </t>

   <t>in Section 4.1 a simple mechanism to learn dynamical the valid 
   IPv6 routers connected to a L2-device is explained. It is important 
   that this LEARN state is only entered intentionally by manual configuration. 
   The list of learned IPv6 routers should be verified by the network manager 
   to make sure that it corresponds with the expected valid RA list. This procedure will 
   make sure that either accidently or intentionally rogue RAs are blocked by RA-guard.

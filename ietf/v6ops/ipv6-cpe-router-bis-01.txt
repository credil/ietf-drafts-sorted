Internet-Draft    IPv6 CE router Advanced Requirements         July 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document defines Advanced IPv6 features for a residential or
   small office router referred to as an IPv6 CE router.  Typically
   these routers also support IPv4.  The IPv6 End-user Network
   Architecture for such a router is described in [RFC6204].  This
   version of the document includes the requirements for Advanced
   features.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   End-user Network          one or more links attached to the IPv6 CE
                             router that connect IPv6 hosts.

   IPv6 Customer Edge router a node intended for home or small office
                             use which forwards IPv6 packets not
                             explicitly addressed to itself.  The IPv6
                             CE router connects the end-user network to
                             a service provider network.

   IPv6 host                 any device implementing an IPv6 stack
                             receiving IPv6 connectivity through the
                             IPv6 CE router

   LAN interface             an IPv6 CE router's attachment to a link in
                             the end-user network.  Examples are
                             Ethernets (simple or bridged), 802.11
                             wireless or other LAN technologies.  An
                             IPv6 CE router may have one or more network
                             layer LAN Interfaces.

   Service Provider          an entity that provides access to the
                             Internet.  In this document, a Service
                             Provider specifically offers Internet
                             access using IPv6, and may also offer IPv4
                             Internet access.  The Service Provider can
                             provide such access over a variety of
                             different transport methods such as DSL,
                             cable, wireless, and others.

   WAN interface             an IPv6 CE router's attachment to a link
                             used to provide connectivity to the Service
                             Provider network; example link technologies
                             include Ethernets (simple or bridged), PPP
                             links, Frame Relay, or ATM networks as well
                             as Internet-layer (or higher-layer)
                             "tunnels", such as tunnels over IPv4 or
                             IPv6 itself.


3.  Conceptual Configuration Variables

   The CE Router maintains such a list of conceptual optional
   configuration variables.

   1.  Enable an IGP on the LAN.

   2.  Configure 6rd configuration.

   3.  Configure IPv6 for 6rd to have IPv6 traffic go to the 6rd Border
       Relay vs. directly to peers.


4.  Architecture

   This document extends the architecture described in [RFC6204] to
   cover a strictly larger set of operational scenarios.  In particular,
   QoS, multicast, DNS, routed network in the home, transition
   technologies, and conceptual configuration variables.  This document
   also extends the model described in [RFC6204] to a two router
   topology where the two routers are connected back-to-back (the LAN of
   one router is connected to the WAN of the other router).  This
   topology is depicted below:

   For DNS, the operational expectation is that the end-user would be
   able to access home hosts from the home using DNS names instead of
   more cumbersome IPv6 addresses.  Note that this is distinct from the
   requirement to access home hosts from outside the home.

   End-users are expected to be able to receive multicast video in the
   home without requiring the CE router to include the cost of
   supporting full multicast routing protocols.

Internet-Draft    IPv6 CE router Advanced Requirements         July 2011


5.  Advanced Features and Feature Requirements

   The IPv6 CE router will need to support connectivity to one or more
   access network architectures.  This document describes an IPv6 CE
   router that is not specific to any particular architecture or Service
   Provider, and supports all commonly used architectures.

5.1.  DNS

   D-1:  The CE Router MAY include a DNS server authoritative for .local
         to handle local queries.  If the service provider specifies one
         or more DNS resolvers in DHCP configuration options, the CE
         router SHOULD forward all non-local DNS queries unchanged to
         those servers.  The CE Router MAY also include DNS64
         functionality which is specified in [RFC6147].

5.2.  Multicast Behavior

   This section is only applicable to a CE Router with at least one LAN
   interface.  A host in the home is expected to receive multicast
   video.  Note the CE Router resides at edge of the home and the
   Service Provider, and the CE Router has at least one WAN connection
   for multiple LAN connections.  In such a multiple LAN to a WAN
   toplogy at the CE Router edge, it is not necessary to run a multicast
   routing protocol and thus MLD Proxy as specified in [RFC4605] can be
   used.  The CE Router discovers the hosts via a MLDv2 Router
   implementation on a LAN interface.  A WAN interface of the CE Router
   interacts with the Service Provider router by sending MLD Reports and
   replying to MLD queries for multicast Group memberships for hosts in
   the home.

   The CE router SHOULD implement MLD Proxy as specified in [RFC4605].
   For the routed topology shown in Figure 1, each router implements a
   MLD Proxy.  If the CE router implements MLD Proxy, the requirements
   on the CE Router for MLD Proxy are listed below.

   WAN requirements, MLD Proxy:

   WMLD-1:  Consistent with [RFC4605], the CE router MUST NOT implement
            the router portion of MLDv2 for the WAN interface.

   LAN requirements, MLD Proxy:

   LMMLD-1:  The CPE Router MUST follow the model described for MLD
             Proxy in [RFC4605] to implement multicast.

Internet-Draft    IPv6 CE router Advanced Requirements         July 2011


   LMMLD-2:  Consistent with [RFC4605], the LAN interfaces on the CPE
             router MUST NOT implement an MLDv2 Multicast Listener.

   LAN requirements:

   LM-1:  If the CE Router has bridging configured between the LAN
          interfaces, then the LAN interfaces MUST support snooping of
          MLD [RFC3810] messages as per [RFC4541] .

5.3.  Routed network behavior

   CPE Router Behavior in a routed network:

   R-1:  One example of the CPE Router use in the home is shown below.
         The home has a broadband modem combined with a CPE Router, all
         in one device.  The LAN interface of the device is connected to
         another standalone CPE Router that supports a wireless access
         point.  To support such a network, this document recommends
         using prefix delegation of the prefix obtained either via IA_PD
         from WAN interface or a ULA from the LAN interface.  The
         network interface of the downstream router MAY obtain an IA_PD
         via stateful DHCPv6.  If the CPE router supports the routed
         network through a vendor specific automatic prefix delegation,
         the CPE router MUST support a DHCPv6 server or DHCPv6 relay
         agent.  Further, if an IA_PD is used, the Service Provider or
         user MUST allocate an IA_PD or ULA prefix short enough to be
         delegated and subsequently used for SLAAC.  Therefore, a prefix
         length shorter than /64 is needed.  The CPE Router MAY support
         and IGP in the home network.

        SP <--+ Modem | CPE Router    +--+ CPE Router | WAP + --> PC

        WAP = Wireless Access Point

5.4.  Transition Technologies Support

5.4.1.  Dual-Stack(DS)-Lite

   Even as users migrate from IPv4 to IPv6 addressing, a significant
   percentage of Internet resources and content will remain accessible

   only through IPv4.  Also, many end-user devices will only support
   IPv4.  As a consequence, Service Providers require mechanisms to
   allow customers to continue to access content and resources using
   IPv4 even after the last IPv4 allocations have been fully depleted.
   One technology that can be used for IPv4 address extension is DS-
   Lite.

   DS-Lite enables a Service Provider to share IPv4 addresses among
   multiple customers by combining two well-known technologies: IP in IP
   (IPv4-in-IPv6) tunneling and Carrier Grade NAT.  More specifically,
   Dual-Stack-Lite encapsulates IPv4 traffic inside an IPv6 tunnel at
   the IPv6 CE Router and sends it to a Service Provider Address Family
   Translation Router (AFTR).  Configuration of the IPv6 CE Router to
   support IPv4 LAN traffic is outside the scope of this document.

   The IPv6 CE Router SHOULD implement DS-Lite functionality as
   specified in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].

   WAN requirements:

   DLW-1:  To facilitate IPv4 extension over an IPv6 network, if the CE
           Router supports DS-Lite functionality, the CE Router WAN
           interface MUST implement a B4 Interface as specified in
           [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].

   DLW-2:  If the IPv6 CE Router implements DS-Lite functionality, the
           CE Router MUST support using a DS-Lite DHCPv6 option
           [I-D.ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option] to configure the
           DS-Lite tunnel.  The IPv6 CE Router MAY use other mechanisms
           to configure DS-Lite parameters.  Such mechanisms are outside
           the scope of this document.

   DLW-3:  IPv6 CE Router MUST NOT perform IPv4 Network Address

   DLW-4:  If the IPv6 CE Router is configured with a public IPv4
           address on its WAN interface, where public IPv4 address is
           defined as any address which is not in the private IP address
           space specified in [RFC1918] and also not in the reserved IP
           address space specified in
           [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite], then the IPv6 CE Router
           MUST disable the DS-Lite B4 element.

   DLW-5:  If DS-Lite is operational on the IPv6 CE Router, multicast
           data MUST NOT be sent on any DS-Lite tunnel.

Internet-Draft    IPv6 CE router Advanced Requirements         July 2011


5.4.2.  6rd

   The IPv6 CE Router can be used to offer IPv6 service to a LAN, even
   when the WAN access network only supports IPv4.  One technology that
   supports IPv6 service over an IPv4 network is IPv6 Rapid Deployment
   (6rd). 6rd encapsulates IPv6 traffic from the end user LAN inside
   IPv4 at the IPv6 CE Router and sends it to a Service Provider Border
   Relay (BR).  The IPv6 CE Router calculates a 6rd delegated IPv6
   prefix during 6rd configuration, and sub-delegates the 6rd delegated
   prefix to devices in the LAN.

   The IPv6 CE Router SHOULD implement 6rd functionality as specified in
   [RFC5969].

   6rd requirements:

   6RD-1:  If the IPv6 CE Router implements 6rd functionality, the CE
           Router WAN interface MUST support at least one 6rd Virtual
           Interface and 6rd CE functionality as specified in [RFC5969].

   6RD-2:  If the IPv6 CE Router implements 6rd CE functionality, it
           MUST support user-entered configuration and using the 6rd
           DHCPv4 Option (212) for 6rd configuration.  The IPv6 CE
           Router MAY use other mechanisms to configure 6rd parameters.
           Such mechanisms are outside the scope of this document.

   6RD-3:  If the CE router implements 6rd functionality, it MUST allow
           the user to specify whether all IPv6 traffic goes to the 6rd
           Border Relay, or whether other destinations within the same
           6rd domain are routed directly to those destinations.  The CE
           router MAY use other mechanisms to configure this.  Such
           mechanisms are outside the scope of this document.

   6RD-4:  If 6rd is operational on the IPv6 CE Router, multicast data
           MUST NOT be sent on any 6rd tunnel.

5.4.3.  Transition Technologies Coexistence

   Run the following four in parallel to provision CPE router
   connectivity to the Service Provider:

   1.  Initiate IPv4 address acquisition.

   2.  Initiate IPv6 address acquisition as specified by [RFC6204].

   3.  If 6rd is provisioned, initiate 6rd.

Internet-Draft    IPv6 CE router Advanced Requirements         July 2011


   4.  If DS-Lite is provisioned, initiate DS-Lite.

   The default route for IPv6 through the native physical interface
   should have preference over the 6rd tunnel interface.  The default
   route for IPv4 through the native physical interface should have
   preference over the DS-Lite tunnel interface.

5.5.  Quality Of Service

   Q-1:  The CPE router MAY support differentiated services [RFC2474].

5.6.  Unicast Data Forwarding

   The null route introduced by the WPD-6 requirement in [RFC6204] has
   lower precedence than other routes except for the default route.

5.7.  Additional DHCPv6 WAN Requirement

   When the WAN interface sends a DHCPV6 SOLICIT message, the CE router
   SHOULD request all mandatory information (IA_NA and IA_PD options) in
   the SOLICIT regardless of whether any partial information was
   received in response to previous SOLICITs.


6.  Security Considerations

   None.

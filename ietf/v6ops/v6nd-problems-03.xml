    <abstract>
      <t>In IPv4, subnets are generally small, made just large enough to cover
      the actual number of machines on the subnet. In contrast, the default
      IPv6 subnet size is a /64, a number so large it covers trillions of
      addresses, the overwhelming number of which will be unassigned.
      Consequently, simplistic implementations of Neighbor Discovery (ND) can
      be vulnerable to deliberate or accidental denial of service, whereby
      they attempt to perform address resolution for large numbers of
      unassigned addresses. Such denial of attacks can be launched
      intentionally (by an attacker), or result from legitimate operational
      tools or accident conditions. As a result of these vulnerabilities, new
      devices may not be able to "join" a network, it may be impossible to
      establish new IPv6 flows, and existing IPv6 transported flows may be
      interrupted.</t>

      <t>This document describes the potential for DOS in detail and suggests
      possible implementation improvements as well as operational mitigation
      techniques that can in some cases be used to protect against or at least
      alleviate the impact of such attacks.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document describes implementation issues with IPv6's Neighbor
      Discovery protocol that can result in vulnerabilities when a network is
      scanned, either by an intruder or through the use of scanning tools that
      perform network inventory, security audits, etc. (e.g. "nmap").</t>

      <t>This document describes the problem in detail, suggests possible
      implementation improvements, as well as operational mitigation
      techniques, that can in some cases protect against such attacks.</t>

      <t>The RFC series documents generally describe the behavior of
      protocols, that is, "what" is to be done by a protocol, but not exactly
      "how" it is to be implemented. The exact details of how best to
      implement a protocol will depend on the overall hardware and software
      architecture of a particular device. The actual "how" decisions are
      (correctly) left in the hands of implementers, so long as
      implementations differences will generally produce proper on-the-wire
      behavior.</t>

      <t>While reading this document, it is important to keep in mind that
      discussions of how things have been implemented beyond basic compliance
      with the specification is not within the scope of the neighbor discovery
      RFCs.</t>

      <section title="Applicability">
        <t>This document is primarily intended for operators of IPV6 networks
        and implementors of <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>. The Document
        provides some operational considerations as well as recommendations to
        increase the resilience of the Neighbor Discovery protocol.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="The Problem">
      <t>In IPv4, subnets are generally small, made just large enough to cover
      the actual number of machines on the subnet. For example, an IPv4 /20
      contains only 4096 address. In contrast, the default IPv6 subnet size is
      a /64, a number so large it covers literally billions of billions of
      addresses, the overwhelming majority of which will be unassigned.
      Consequently, simplistic implementations of Neighbor Discovery may fail
      to perform as desired when they perform address resolution of large
      numbers of unassigned addresses. Such failures can be triggered either
      intentionally by an attacker launching a Denial of Service attack (DoS)
      to exploit this vulnerability, or unintentionally due to the use of
      legitimate operational tools that scan networks for inventory and other
      purposes. As a result of these failures, new devices may not be able to
      "join" a network, it may be impossible to establish new IPv6 flows, and
      existing IPv6 transport flows may be interrupted.</t>

      <t>Network scans attempt to find and probe devices on a network.
      Typically, scans are performed on a range of target addresses, or all
      the addresses on a particular subnet. When such probes are directed via
      a router, and the target addresses are on a directly attached network,
      the router will attempt to perform address resolution on a large number
      of destinations (i.e., some fraction of the 2^64 addresses on the
      subnet). The router's process of testing for the (non)existence of
      neighbors can induce a denial of service condition, where the number of
      necessary Neighbor Discovery requests overwhelms the implementation's
      capacity to process them, exhausts available memoryand replaces existing
      in-use mappings with incomplete entries that will never be completed. A
      directed DoS attack may seek to intentionally create similar conditions
      to that created unintentionally by a network scan. The resulting network
      disruption may impact existing traffic, and devices that join the
      network may find that address resolution attempts fail. The DOS as a
      consequence of network scanning was previously described in <xref
      target="RFC5157"></xref></t>

      <t>In order to mitigate risk associated with this DoS threat, some
      router implementations have taken steps to rate-limit the processing
      rate of Neighbor Solicitations (NS). While these mitigations do help,
      they do not fully address the issue and may introduce their own set of
      issues to the neighbor discovery process.</t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Address Resolution">Address resolution is the process
          through which a node determines the link-layer address of a neighbor
          given only its IP address. In IPv6, address resolution is performed
          as part of Neighbor Discovery <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>,
          p60</t>

          <t hangText="Forwarding Plane">That part of a router responsible for
          forwarding packets. In higher-end routers, the forwarding plane is
          typically implemented in specialized hardware optimized for
          performance. Steps in the forwarding process include determining the
          correct outgoing interface for a packet, decrementing its Time To
          Live (TTL), verifying and updating the checksum, placing the correct
          link-layer header on the packet, and forwarding it.</t>

          <t hangText="Control Plane">That part of the router implementation
          that maintains the data structures that determine where packets
          should be forwarded. The control plane is typically implemented as a
          "slower" software process running on a general purpose processor and
          is responsible for such functions as communicating network status
          changes via routing protocols, maintaining the forwarding table,
          performing management, and resolving the correct link-layer address
          for adjacent neighbors. The control plane "controls" the forwarding
          plane by programming it with the information needed for packet
          forwarding.</t>

          <t hangText="Neighbor Cache">As described in <xref
          target="RFC4861"></xref>, the data structure that holds the cache of
          (amongst other things) IP address to link-layer address mappings for
          connected nodes. As the information in the Neighbor Cache is needed
          by the forwarding plane every time it forwards a packet, it is
          usually implemented in an ASIC.</t>

          <t hangText="Neighbor Discovery Process">The Neighbor Discovery
          Process (NDP) is that part of the control plane that implements the
          Neighbor Discovery protocol. NDP is responsible for performing
          address resolution and maintaining the Neighbor Cache. When
          forwarding packets, the forwarding plane accesses entries within the
          Neighbor Cache. When the forwarding plane processes a packet for
          which the corresponding Neighbor Cache Entry is missing or
          incomplete, it notifies NDP to take appropriate action (typically
          via a shared queue). NDP picks up requests from the shared queue and
          performs any necessary discovery action. In many implementations the
          NDP is also responsible for responding to router solicitation
          messages, Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD), etc.</t>

      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Background">
      <t>Modern router architectures separate the forwarding of packets
      (forwarding plane) from the decisions needed to decide where the packets
      should go (control plane). In order to deal with the high number of
      packets per second, the forwarding plane is generally implemented in
      hardware and is highly optimized for the task of forwarding packets. In
      contrast, the NDP control plane is mostly implemented in software
      processes running on a general purpose processor.</t>

      <t>When a router needs to forward an IP packet, the forwarding plane
      logic performs the longest match lookup to determine where to send the
      packet and what outgoing interface to use. To deliver the packet to an
      adjacent node, the forwarding plane encapsulates the packet in a
      link-layer frame (which contains a header with the link-layer
      destination address). The forwarding plane logic checks the Neighbor
      Cache to see if it already has a suitable link-layer destination, and if
      not, places the request for the required information into a queue, and
      signals the control plane (i.e., NDP) that it needs the link-layer
      address resolved.</t>

      <t>In order to protect NDP specifically and the control plane generally
      from being overwhelmed with these requests, appropriate steps must be
      taken. For example, the size and fill rate of the queue might be
      limited. NDP running in the control plane of the router dequeues
      requests and performs the address resolution function (by performing a
      neighbor solicitation and listening for a neighbor advertisement). This
      process is usually also responsible for other activities needed to
      maintain link-layer information, such as Neighbor Unreachability
      Detection (NUD).</t>

      <t>By sending appropriate packets to addresses on a given subnet, an
      attacker can cause the router to queue attempts to resolve so many
      addresses that it crowds out attempts to resolve "legitimate" addresses
      (and in many cases becomes unable to perform maintenance of existing
      entries in the neighbor cache, and unable to answer Neighbor
      Solicitation). This condition can result in the inability to resolve new
      neighbors and loss of reachability to neighbors with existing ND-Cache
      entries. During testing it was concluded that 4 simultaneous nmap
      sessions from a low-end computer was sufficient to make a router's
      neighbor discovery process unusable and therefore forwarding became
      unavailable to the destination subnets.</t>

      <t>The failure to maintain proper NDP behavior whilst under attack has
      been observed across multiple platforms and implementations, including
      the largest routers available (when this document was started) from two
      of the largest vendors.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Neighbor Discovery Overview">
      <t>When a packet arrives at (or is generated by) a router for a
      destination on an attached link, the router needs to determine the
      correct link-layer address to use in the destination field of the layer
      2 encapsulation. The router checks the Neighbor Cache for an existing
      Neighbor Cache Entry for the neighbor, and if none exists, invokes the
      address resolution portions of the <xref target="RFC4861">IPv6 Neighbor
      Discovery </xref> protocol to determine the link-layer address of the
      neighbor.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC4861"></xref> Section 5.2 (Conceptual Sending
      Algorithm) outlines how this process works. A very high level summary is
      that the device creates a new Neighbor Cache Entry for the neighbor,
      sets the state to INCOMPLETE, queues the packet and initiates the actual
      address resolution process. The device then sends out one or more
      Neighbor Solicitations, and when it receives a corresponding Neighbor
      Advertisement, completes the Neighbor Cache Entry and sends the queued
      packet.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Operational Mitigation Options">
      <t>This section provides some feasible mitigation options that can be
      employed today by network operators in order to protect network
      availability while vendors implement more effective protection measures.
      It can be stipulated that some of these options are "kludges", and are
      operationally difficult to manage. They are presented, as they represent
      options we currently have. It is each operator's responsibility to
      evaluate and understand the impact of changes to their network due to
      these measures.</t>

      <section title="Filtering of unused address space.">
        <t>The DoS condition is induced by making a router try to resolve
        addresses on the subnet at a high rate. By carefully addressing
        machines into a small portion of a subnet (such as the lowest numbered
        addresses), it is possible to filter access to addresses not in that
        assigned portion of address space using Access Control Lists (ACLs),
        or by null routing, features which are available on most existing
        platforms. This will prevent the attacker from making the router
        attempt to resolve unused addresses. For example if there are only 50
        hosts connected to an interface, you may be able to filter any address
        above the first 64 addresses of that subnet by null-routing the subnet
        carrying a more specific /122 route or by applying ACLs on the WAN
        link to prevent the attack traffic reaching the vulnerable device.</t>

        <t>As mentioned at the beginning of this section, it is fully
        understood that this is ugly (and difficult to manage); but failing
        other options, it may be a useful technique especially when responding
        to an attack.</t>

        <t>This solution requires that the hosts be statically or statefully
        addressed (as is often done in a datacenter) and may not interact well
        with networks using <xref target="RFC4862"></xref></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Minimal Subnet Sizing.">
        <t>By sizing subnets to reflect the number of addresses actually in
        use, the problem can be avoided. For example, <xref
        target="RFC6164"></xref> recommends sizing the subnets for
        inter-router links to only have 2 addresses (a /127). It is worth
        noting that this practice is common in IPv4 networks, in part to
        protect against the harmful effects of ARP request flooding.</t>

        <t>Subnet prefixes longer than a /64 are not able to use stateless
        auto-configuration <xref target="RFC4862"></xref> so this approach is
        not suitable for use with hosts that are not statically
        configured.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Routing Mitigation.">
        <t>One very effective technique is to route the subnet to a discard
        interface (most modern router platforms can discard traffic in
        hardware / the forwarding plane) and then have individual hosts
        announce routes for their IP addresses into the network (or use some
        method to inject much more specific addresses into the local routing
        domain). For example the network 2001:db8:1:2:3::/64 could be routed
        to a discard interface on "border" routers, and then individual hosts
        could announce 2001:db8:1:2:3::10/128, 2001:db8:1:2:3::66/128 into the
        IGP. This is typically done by having the IP address bound to a
        virtual interface on the host (for example the loopback interface),
        enabling IP forwarding on the host and having it run a routing daemon.
        For obvious reasons, host participation in the IGP makes many
        operators uncomfortable, but can be a very powerful technique if used
        in a disciplined and controlled manner. One method to help address
        these concerns is to have the hosts participate in a different IGP (or
        difference instance of the same IGP) and carefully redistribute into
        the main IGP.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Tuning of the NDP Queue Rate Limit.">
        <t>Many implementations provide a means to control the rate of
        resolution of unknown addresses. By tuning this rate, it may be
        possible to ameliorate the issue, as with most tuning knobs
        (especially those that deal with rate limiting), the attack may be
        completed more quickly due to the lower threshold. By excessively
        lowering this rate you may negatively impact how long the device takes
        to learn new addresses under normal conditions (for example, after
        clearing the neighbor cache or when the router first boots). Under
        attack conditions you may be unable to resolve "legitimate" addresses
        sooner than if you had just left the parameter untouched.</t>

        <t>It is worth noting that this technique is worth investigating only
        if the device has separate queues for resolution of unknown addresses
        and the maintenance of existing entries.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Recommendations for Implementors.">
      <t>The section provides some recommendations to implementors of IPv6
      Neighbor Discovery.</t>

      <t>At a high-level, implementors should program defensively. That is,
      they should assume that attackers will attempt to exploit implementation
      weaknesses, and should ensure that implementations are robust to various
      attacks. In the case of Neighbor Discovery, the following general
      considerations apply:</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Manage Resources Explicitly">Resources such as
          processor cycles, memory, etc. are never infinite, yet with IPv6's
          large subnets it is easy to cause NDP to generate large numbers of
          address resolution requests for non-existent destinations.
          Implementations need to limit resources devoted to processing
          Neighbor Discovery requests in a thoughtful manner.</t>

          <t hangText="Prioritize">Some NDP requests are more important than
          others. For example, when resources are limited, responding to
          Neighbor Solicitations for one's own address is more important than
          initiating address resolution requests that create new entries.
          Likewise, performing Neighbor Unreachability Detection, which by
          definition is only invoked on destinations that are actively being
          used, is more important than creating new entries for possibly
          non-existent neighbors.</t>
        </list></t>

      <section title="Prioritize NDP Activities">
        <t>Not all Neighbor Discovery activities are equally important.
        Specifically, requests to perform large numbers of address resolutions
        on non-existent Neighbor Cache Entries should not come at the expense
        of servicing requests related to keeping existing, in-use entries
        properly up-to-date. Thus, implementations should divide work
        activities into categories having different priorities. The following
        gives examples of different activities and their importance in rough
        priority order. If implmented, the operation and priority of these
        SHOULD be configurable by the operator.</t>

        <t>1. It is critical to respond to Neighbor Solicitations for one's
        own address, especially for a router. Whether for address resolution
        or Neighbor Unreachability Detection, failure to respond to Neighbor
        Solicitations results in immediate problems. Failure to respond to NS
        requests that are part of NUD can cause neighbors to delete the NCE
        for that address, and will result in followup NS messages using
        multicast. Once an entry has been flushed, existing traffic for
        destinations using that entry can no longer be forwarded until address
        resolution completes successfully. In other words, not responding to
        NS messages further increases the NDP load, and causes on-going
        communication to fail.</t>

        <t>2. It is critical to revalidate one's own existing NCEs in need of
        refresh. As part of NUD, ND is required to frequently revalidate
        existing, in-use entries. Failure to do so can result in the entry
        being discarded. For in-use entries, discarding the entry will almost
        certainly result in a subsequent request to perform address resolution
        on the entry, but this time using multicast. As above, once the entry
        has been flushed, existing traffic for destinations using that entry
        can no longer be forwarded until address resolution completes
        successfully.</t>

        <t>3. To maintain the stability of the control plane, Neighbor
        Discovery activity related to traffic sourced by the router (as
        opposed to traffic being forwarded by the router) should be given high
        priority. Whenever network problems occur, debugging and making other
        operational changes requires being able to query and access the
        router. In addition, routing protocols dependent on Neighbor Discovery
        for connectivity may begin to react (negatively) to perceived
        connectivity problems, causing additional undesirable ripple
        effects.</t>

        <t>4. Traffic to unknown addresses should be given lowest priority.
        Indeed, it may be useful to distinguish between "never seen" addresses
        and those that have been seen before, but that do not have a
        corresponding NCE. Specifically, the conceptual processing algorithm
        in <xref target="RFC4861">IPv6 Neighbor Discovery </xref> calls for
        deleting NCEs under certain conditions. Rather than delete them
        completely, however, it might be useful to at least keep track of the
        fact that an entry at one time existed, in order to prioritize address
        resolution requests for such neighbors compared with neighbors that
        have never been seen before.</t>

      <section title="Queue Tuning.">
        <t>On implementations in which requests to NDP are submitted via a
        single queue, router vendors SHOULD provide operators with means to
        control both the rate of link-layer address resolution requests placed
        into the queue and the size of the queue. This will allow operators to
        tune Neighbour Discovery for their specific environment. The ability
        to set, or have per interface or per prefix queue limits at a rate
        below that of the global queue limit might limit the damage to the
        neighbor discovery processing to the network targeted by the
        attack.</t>

        <t>Setting those values must be a very careful balancing act - the
        lower the rate of entry into the queue, the less load there will be on
        the ND process, however, it will take the router longer to learn
        legitimate destinations as a result. In a datacenter with 6,000 hosts
        attached to a single router, setting that value to be under 1000 would
        mean that resolving all of the addresses from an initial state (or
        something that invalidates the address cache, such as a STP TCN) may
        take over 6 seconds. Similarly, the lower the size of the queue, the
        higher the likelihood of an attack being able to knock out legitimate
        traffic (but less memory utilization on the router).</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document outlines mitigation options that operators can use to
      protect themselves from Denial of Service attacks. Implementation advice
      to router vendors aimed at ameliorating known problems carries the risk
      of previously unforeseen consequences. It is not believed that these
      mitigation techniques or the implementation of finer-grained queuing of
      NDP activity create additional security risks or DoS exposure.</t>

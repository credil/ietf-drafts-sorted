    <abstract>
      <t>In Proxy Mobile IPv6, packets received from a Mobile Node (MN) by the
      Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to which it is attached are typically
      tunneled to a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for routing. The term
      "localized routing" refers to a method by which packets are routed
      directly between an MN's MAG and the MAG of its Correspondent Node (CN)
      without involving any LMA. In order to establish a localized routing
      session between two Mobile Access Gateways in a Proxy Mobile IPv6
      domain, the usage of localized routing may be authorized for both MAGs.
      This document specifies how to accomplish this using the Diameter
      protocol.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC5213">Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6)</xref> allows the
      Mobility Access Gateway to optimize media delivery by locally routing
      packets from a Mobile Node to a Correspondent Node that is locally
      attached to an access link connected to the same Mobile Access Gateway,
      avoiding tunneling them to the Mobile Node's Local Mobility Anchor. This
      is referred to as "local routing" in RFC 5213. However, this mechanism
      is not applicable to the typical scenarios in which the MN and CN are
      connected to different MAGs and are registered to the same LMA or
      different LMAs. <xref target="RFC6279"></xref> defines the problem
      statement for PMIPv6 localized routing. <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-netext-pmip-lr"></xref> describes a solution for PMIPv6
      localized routing based on the scenarios defined in <xref
      target="RFC6279"></xref>. In these scenarios the information needed to set up a
      localized routing path (e.g., the addresses of the Mobile Access
      Gateways to which the MN and CN are respectively attached) is
      distributed between their respective Local Mobility Anchors. This may
      complicate the setup and maintenance of localized routing.
	  <vspace blankLines="1" />
	  Therefore, in order to establish a localized routing
      path between the two Mobile Access Gateways, the Mobile Node's MAG must
      identify the LMA that is managing the Correspondent Node's traffic and
      then obtain the address of the Correspondent Node's MAG from that LMA.
      In Proxy Mobile IPv6, the LMA to be assigned to the CN may be maintained
      as a configured entry in the Correspondent Node's policy profile located
      on an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server.
      However, there is no relevant work discussing how AAA-based mechanisms
      can be used by the Mobile Node's MAG or LMA to discover the address of
      the Correspondent Node's LMA during the setup of localized routing; in addition,
	  authorization from AAA for enabling localized routing is
      unspecified.

    <section title="Example Signaling Flows for Localized Routing Service Authorization">
      <t>Localized Routing Service Authorization can happen during the network
      access authentication procedure <xref target="RFC5779"></xref>, i.e.,
      before localized routing is initialized. In this case, the preauthorized
      pairs of LMA/prefix sets can be downloaded to Proxy Mobile IPv6 entities
      during the RFC 5779 procedure. Localized routing can be initiated once
      the destination of a received packet matches one or more of the prefixes
      received during the RFC 5779 procedure.</t>

      <t><xref target="fig2"></xref> shows an example scenario in which MAG1 acts
      as a Diameter client, processing the data packet from MN1 to MN2 and
      requesting authorization of localized routing. In this example scenario,
      MN1 and MN2 are anchored to the same LMA. In this case, in order to
      setup a localized routing path with MAG2, MAG1 must first locate the
      entity that maintains the data required to setup the path (i.e., the LMA
      corresponding to MN2 or LMA2) by sending a Request message to LMA1. The
      request message is the Localized Routing Initialization (LRI) message in
      <xref target="fig2"></xref> and belongs to the Initial phase of the
      localized routing. The Diameter client in LMA1 sends an AAR message to
      the Diameter server. The message contains an instance of the
      MIP6-Feature-Vector (MFV) AVP (<xref target="RFC5447"></xref>, Section
      4.2.5) with the INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit (<xref
      target="flagbit"></xref>) set and an instance of the
      MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix AVP (<xref target="RFC5779"></xref>, Section 5.3)
      or an instance of the PMIP6-IPv4-Home-Address AVP (<xref
      target="RFC5779"></xref>, Section 5.2) containing the IP address/HNP of
      MN2. <vspace blankLines="1" />The Diameter server authorizes localized
      routing service by checking if MN2 is allowed to use localized routing.
      If so, the Diameter server responds with an AAA message encapsulating an
      instance of the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP <xref target="RFC5779"></xref>
      containing the IP address and/or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of
      LMA corresponding to MN2 (i.e., LMA2) and an instance of the
      MIP6-Feature-Vector (MFV) AVP (<xref target="RFC5447"></xref>, Section
      4.2.5) with the INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit (<xref
      target="flagbit"></xref>) set indicating direct routing of IP packets
      between MNs anchored to different MAGs is supported. LMA1 then
      determines the IP address of LMA corresponding to MN2 using the data
      returned in the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP and responds to MAG1 with the
      address of LMA corresponding to MN2 in the Localized Routing Acknowledge
      message (LRA in <xref target="fig2"></xref>). If MAG1 knows that MN1
      and MN2 belong to the same LMA, it requests the address of MAG2 from the
      same LMA as MN1 and uses that address to setup the localized routing
      path between itself and MAG2 via a Proxy Binding Update (PBU)/Proxy
      Binding Acknowledgement (PBA) message exchange <xref
      target="RFC5213"></xref>. If MAG1 knows that MN2 belongs to a different LMA
	  (which can be determined by looking up the binding cache entries
      corresponding to MN1 and MN2 and comparing the addresses of LMA1 and
      LMA2),
      MAG1 SHOULD request the address of MAG2 from LMA2; the
      subsequent localized routing path setup is similar to the case where the
      MNs share LMAs.
	  <vspace blankLines="1"/>
	  Note: This case is mentioned in RFC 6279 but not covered by <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-netext-pmip-lr"></xref>; it is used here as an illustration
      of the capabilities provided by the AAA infrastructure, possibly for future
      use.

      <t><xref target="fig3"></xref> shows another example scenario, in which
      LMA1 acts as a Diameter client, processing the data packet from MN2
      to MN1 and requesting the authorization of localized routing. In this
      scenario, MN1 and MN2 are anchored to the same LMA. In contrast
      with the signaling flow shown in <xref target="fig2"></xref>, it is LMA1
      instead of MAG1 which initiates the setup of the localized routing path.
      <vspace blankLines="1" />
	  The Diameter client in LMA1 sends an AA-Request
      message to the Diameter server. The message contains an instance of the
      MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP (<xref target="RFC5447"></xref>, Section 4.2.5)
      with the INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit set and either an instance of the
      MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix AVP (<xref target="RFC5779"></xref>, Section 5.3)
      or an instance of the PMIP6-IPv4-Home-Address AVP (<xref
      target="RFC5779"></xref>, Section 5.2) containing the IP address/HNP of
      MN2. The Diameter server authorizes the localized routing service by
      checking if MN2 is allowed to use localized routing.
	  If so, the Diameter
      server responds with an AA-Answer message encapsulating an instance of
      the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP <xref target="RFC5779"></xref> containing the IP
      address and/or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of LMA corresponding
      to MN2 (i.e.,LMA2) and an instance of the MIP6-Feature-Vector (MFV) AVP
      (<xref target="RFC5447"></xref>, Section 4.2.5) with the
      INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit (<xref target="flagbit"></xref>) set
      indicating direct routing of IP packets between MNs anchored to
      different MAGs is supported. LMA1 then determines the IP address of
      LMA corresponding to MN2 using the data returned in the MIP6-Agent-Info
      AVP and responds to MAG1 with the address of LMA corresponding to MN2.
      If LMA1 knows that MN1 and MN2 share the same LMA, then the LMA may look up
      the address of MAG2 directly based on the IP address of MN2 and send a
      request message (LRI in <xref target="fig3"/>)
	  to MAG1 for localized routing with
      the IP address of MAG2 included. The MAG1 confirms the success of
      localized routing if a localized routing path can be setup. If LMA1
      knows that MN2 belongs to a different LMA (e.g., LMA2),
      LMA1 SHOULD initiate an exchange with LMA2 to trigger the
      corresponding LMA to setup binding entries on the corresponding MAG for
      localized routing and configure MAG1 and MAG2 to use the same
      encapsulation mechanism as that being used for the PMIP tunnel between
      the MAG and LMA without special configuration or dynamic tunneling
      negotiation between MAGs.

          <abstract>
            <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network based mobility
            management protocol that enables IP mobility for a host without
            requiring its participation in any mobility-related signaling.
            PMIPv6 requires all communications to go through the local
            mobility anchor. As this can be suboptimal, localized routing (LR)
            allows mobile nodes attached to the same or different mobile
            access gateways to route traffic by using localized forwarding or
            a direct tunnel between the gateways. This document proposes
            initiation, utilization and termination mechanisms for localized
            routing between mobile access gateways within a proxy mobile IPv6
            domain. It defines two new signaling messages, Localized Routing
            Initiation (LRI) and Local Routing Acknowledgment (LRA), that are
            used to realize this mechanism.</t>

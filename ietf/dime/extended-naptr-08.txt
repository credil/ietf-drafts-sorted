Abstract

   The Diameter base protocol specifies mechanisms whereby a given realm
   may advertise Diameter nodes and the supported transport protocol.
   However, these mechanisms do not reveal the Diameter applications
   that each node supports.  A peer outside the realm would have to
   perform a Diameter capability exchange with every node until it
   discovers one that supports the required application.  This document
   updates [RFC3588] and describes an improvement using an extended
   format for the Straightforward-Naming Authority Pointer (S-NAPTR)
   Application Service Tag that allows for discovery of the supported
   applications without doing Diameter capability exchange beforehand.

Internet-Draft             dime-extended-naptr                  May 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Diameter base protocol [RFC3588] specifies three mechanisms for
   the Diameter peer discovery.  One of these involves the Diameter
   implementation performing a Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) query
   [RFC3403] for a server in a particular realm.  These NAPTR records
   provide a mapping from a domain, to the SRV record [RFC2782] or
   A/AAAA record [RFC1035][RFC3596] for contacting a server with the
   specific transport protocol in the NAPTR services field.

   The extended NAPTR usage for Diameter peer discovery defined by this
   document is based on the Straightforward-NAPTR (S-NAPTR) Dynamic
   Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application defined in [RFC3958].
   This document updates the Diameter peer discovery procedure described
   in Section 11.6 of [RFC3588] and defines S-NAPTR Application Service
   and Application Protocol Tag values that permit the discovery of
   Diameter peers that support a specific Diameter application and
   transport protocol.


2.  Terminology

   The Diameter base protocol specification (Section 1.4 of [RFC3588])
   and the Straightforward-NAPTR (S-NAPTR) DDDS application (section 2.1
   in [RFC3958]) define the terminology used in this document.


3.  Extended NAPTR Service Field Format

   The NAPTR Service Field format defined by the S-NAPTR DDDS
   application in [RFC3958] follows this Augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF, [RFC5234]):

       service-parms = [ [app-service] *(":" app-protocol)]
       app-service   = experimental-service  / iana-registered-service
       app-protocol  = experimental-protocol / iana-registered-protocol
       experimental-service      = "x-" 1*30ALPHANUMSYM
       experimental-protocol     = "x-" 1*30ALPHANUMSYM
       iana-registered-service   = ALPHA *31ALPHANUMSYM
       iana-registered-protocol  = ALPHA *31ALPHANUMSYM
       ALPHA         =  %x41-5A / %x61-7A   ; A-Z / a-z
       DIGIT         =  %x30-39 ; 0-9
       SYM           =  %x2B / %x2D / %x2E  ; "+" / "-" / "."
       ALPHANUMSYM   =  ALPHA / DIGIT / SYM
       ; The app-service and app-protocol tags are limited to 32
       ; characters and must start with an alphabetic character.
       ; The service-parms are considered case-insensitive.

   This specification refines the "iana-registered-service" tag
   definition for the discovery of Diameter agents supporting a specific
   Diameter application as defined below.

       iana-registered-service = aaa-service / ALPHA *31ALPHANUMSYM
       aaa-service             = "aaa+ap" appln-id
       appln-id                = 1*DIGIT
                                 ; Application identifier expressed as a
                                 ; decimal integer.

   This specification also refines the "iana-registered-protocol" tag
   definition for the discovery of Diameter agents supporting a specific
   Diameter transport protocol as defined below.

       iana-registered-protocol = aaa-protocol / ALPHA *31ALPHANUMSYM
       aaa-protocol             = "diameter." aaa-transport
       aaa-transport            = "tcp" / "sctp" / "tls.tcp"

   The maximum length of the NAPTR service field is 256 octets including
   one octet length field (see Section 4.1 of RFC 3403 and Section 3.3
   of [RFC1035]).

3.1.  IETF Standard Track Diameter Applications

   A Diameter agent MUST be capable of using the extended S-NAPTR
   Application Service Tag for dynamic discovery of a Diameter agent
   supporting Standard Track applications.  Therefore, every IETF
   Standard Track Diameter application MUST be associated with a "aaa-
   service" tag formatted as defined in this specification and allocated
   in accordance with the IANA policy (see Section 7).

   For example, a NAPTR service field value of:

   'aaa+ap6:diameter.sctp'

      Means that the Diameter node in the SRV or A/AAAA record supports
      the Diameter Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Application ('6')
      and SCTP as the transport protocol.

3.2.  Vendor-specific Diameter Applications

   S-NAPTR Application Service and Application Protocol Tag values can
   also be used to discover Diameter peers that support a vendor-
   specific Diameter application.  In this case, the vendor-specific
   Diameter application MUST be associated with a "aaa-service" tag
   formatted as defined in this specification and allocated in
   accordance with the IANA policy (see Section 7).

   For example, a NAPTR service field value of:

   'aaa+ap16777251:diameter.sctp'

      Means that the Diameter node in the SRV or A/AAAA record supports
      the Diameter 3GPP S6a Application ('16777251') and SCTP as the
      transport protocol.


4.  Backwards Compatibility

   Domain Name System (DNS) administrators SHOULD also provision legacy
   RFC 3588 style NAPTR records [RFC3403] in order to guarantee
   backwards compatibility with legacy RFC 3588 compliant Diameter
   peers.  If the DNS administrator provisions both extended S-NAPTR
   records as defined in this specification and legacy RFC 3588 NAPTR
   records, then the extended S-NAPTR records MUST have higher priority
   (e.g. lower order and/or preference values) than legacy NAPTR
   records.


5.  Extended NAPTR-based Diameter Peer Discovery

   The Diameter Peer Discovery principles are described in Section 5.2
   of [RFC3588].  This specification updates the NAPTR query procedure
   in the Diameter peer discovery mechanism by allowing the querying
   node to determine which applications are supported by resolved
   Diameter peers.

   The extended format NAPTR records provide a mapping from a domain to
   the SRV record or A/AAAA record for contacting a server supporting a
   specific transport protocol and Diameter application.  The resource
   record will contain an empty regular expression and a replacement
   value, which is the SRV record or the A/AAAA record for that
   particular transport protocol.

   The assumption for this mechanism to work is that the DNS
   administrator of the queried domain has first provisioned the DNS
   with extended format NAPTR entries.  The steps below replace the
   NAPTR query procedure steps in Section 5.2 of [RFC3588].

   a. The Diameter implementation performs a NAPTR query for a server in
      a particular realm.  The Diameter implementation has to know in
      advance which realm to look for a Diameter agent in and which
      Application Identifier it is interested in.  For example, the
      realm could be deduced from the Network Access Identifier (NAI) in
      the User-Name AVP or extracted from the Destination-Realm AVP.

   b. If the returned NAPTR service fields contain entries formatted as
      "aaa+apX:Y" where "X" indicates the Application Identifier and "Y"
      indicates the supported transport protocol(s), the target realm
      supports the extended format for NAPTR-based Diameter peer
      discovery defined in this document.

         If "X" contains the required Application Identifier and "Y"
         matches a supported transport protocol, the Diameter
         implementation resolves the "replacement" field entry to a
         target host using the lookup method appropriate for the "flags"
         field.

         If "X" does not contain the required Application Identifier or
         "Y" does not match a supported transport protocol, the Diameter
         implementation abandons the peer discovery.

   c. If the returned NAPTR service fields contain entries formatted as
      "aaa+apX" where "X" indicates the Application Identifier, the
      target realm supports the extended format for NAPTR-based Diameter
      peer discovery defined in this document.

         If "X" contains the required Application Identifier, the
         Diameter implementation resolves the "replacement" field entry
         to a target host using the lookup method appropriate for the
         "flags" field and attempts to connect using all supported
         transport protocols following the order specified in section
         2.1 of [RFC3588].

         If "X" does not contain the required Application Identifier,
         the Diameter implementation abandons the peer discovery.

   d. If the returned NAPTR service fields contain entries formatted as
      "aaa:X" where "X" indicates the supported transport protocol(s),
      the target realm supports Diameter but does not support the
      extended format for NAPTR-based Diameter peer discovery defined in
      this document.

         If "X" matches a supported transport protocol, the Diameter
         implementation resolves the "replacement" field entry to a
         target host using the lookup method appropriate for the "flags"
         field.

   e. If the returned NAPTR service fields contain entries formatted as
      "aaa", the target realm supports Diameter but does not support the
      extended format for NAPTR-based Diameter peer discovery defined in
      this document.  The Diameter implementation resolves the
      "replacement" field entry to a target host using the lookup method
      appropriate for the "flags" field and attempts to connect using

      all supported transport protocols following the order specified in
      section 2.1 of [RFC3588].

   f. If the target realm does not support NAPTR-based Diameter peer
      discovery, the client proceeds with the next peer discovery
      mechanism described in Section 5.2 of [RFC3588].


6.  Usage Guidelines

   Diameter is a peer to peer protocol whereas most of the applications
   that extend the base protocol behave like client/server applications.
   The role of the peer is not advertised in the NAPTR tags and not even
   communicated during Diameter capability negotiation (Capabilities-
   Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer message exchange).
   For this reason, NAPTR-based Diameter peer discovery for an
   application defining client/server roles should only be used by a
   client to discover servers.


7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  IETF Diameter Application Service Tags

   IANA is requested to reserve a value of "aaa" for Diameter in the
   S-NAPTR Application Service Tag registry created by [RFC3958].  IANA
   is also requested to reserve the following S-NAPTR Application
   Service Tags for existing IETF Diameter applications in the same
   registry.

   Future WiMAX Forum Diameter applications can reserve entries in the
   S-NAPTR Application Service Tag registry created by [RFC3958] which
   correspond to the allocated Diameter Application IDs as defined in
   Section 3.

7.4.  Vendor-Specific Diameter Application Service Tags

   Vendor-Specific Diameter Application IDs are allocated by IANA
   according to the "First Come First Served" policy and do not require
   an IETF specification.  However, the S-NAPTR Application Service Tag
   registry created by [RFC3958] defines a registration policy of
   "Specification Required" with a further stipulation that the
   "specification" is an RFC (of any category).  If a Vendor-Specific
   Diameter Application requires the functionality defined in this
   document, an RFC of any category MUST be published which reserves the
   S-NAPTR Application Service Tag corresponding to the Vendor-Specific
   Diameter Application ID as defined in Section 3.

7.5.  Diameter Application Protocol Tags

   IANA is requested to reserve the following S-NAPTR Application
   Protocol Tags for the Diameter transport protocols in the S-NAPTR
   Application Protocol Tag registry created by [RFC3958].

                      +------------------+----------+
                      | Tag              | Protocol |
                      +------------------+----------+
                      | diameter.tcp     | TCP      |
                      | diameter.sctp    | SCTP     |
                      | diameter.tls.tcp | TLS/TCP  |
                      +------------------+----------+


8.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies an enhancement to RFC 3588 Diameter base
   protocol defined NAPTR service field format and also modifications to
   the NAPTR processing logic defined.  The enhancements and
   modifications are based on the S-NAPTR, which is actually a
   simplification of the NAPTR, and therefore the same security
   considerations described in RFC 3588 are applicable to this document.
   No further extensions are required beyond the security mechanisms
   offered by RFC 3588.  However, a malicious host doing S-NAPTR queries

   learns applications supported by Diameter agents in a certain realm
   faster, which might help the malicious host to scan potential targets
   for an attack more efficiently when some applications have known
   vulnerabilities.

10.  Editor's Notes

   This section to be removed prior to publication.

   This draft updates sections of RFC3588 that are also being updated by
   RFC3588bis.  At the time this draft was started, it was uncertain
   whether RFC3588bis would be published first.  The authors of this
   draft decided to proceed optimistically assuming this draft would be
   published first with the understanding that minor updates are
   required if this is not the case.

   The application-neutral aspects of Diameter S-NAPTR usage (e.g "aaa:
   diameter.sctp") were also contributed to RFC3588bis to ensure that it
   would be functionally complete if it got published first and this
   draft would come along later to add the application-specific S-NAPTR
   entries (e.g."aaa+ap5:diameter.sctp").

   Depending on the publication order, the S-NAPTR Application Service
   Tag registry value of "aaa" and the S-NAPTR Application Protocol Tags
   values ("diameter.tcp"/"diameter.sctp"/"diameter.tls.tcp") will need
   to be removed either from this draft or RFC3588bis.

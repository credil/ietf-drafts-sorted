    <abstract>
      <t>The Diameter base protocol is intended to provide an Authentication,
      Authorization and Accounting (AAA) framework for applications such as
      network access or IP mobility in both local and roaming situations.  
      This document specifies the message format, transport, error 
      reporting, accounting and security services used by all Diameter 
      applications. The Diameter base protocol as defined in this document
      must be supported by all Diameter implementations.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>
  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) protocols such as
      TACACS
      <xref target="RFC1492" /> and RADIUS
      <xref target="RFC2865" /> were initially deployed to provide dial-up PPP

      <xref target="RFC1661" /> and terminal server access. Over time, AAA support 
      was needed on many new access technologies, the scale and complexity of AAA
      networks grew, and AAA was also used on new applications (such as voice
      over IP). This lead to new demands on AAA protocols.</t>
      <t>Network access requirements for AAA protocols are summarized in
      <xref target="RFC2989" />. These include:
      <vspace blankLines="1" />
      <list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="Failover">
        <vspace blankLines="1" />
        <xref target="RFC2865" /> does not define failover mechanisms, and as
        a result, failover behavior differs between implementations. In order
        to provide well-defined failover behavior, Diameter supports
        application-layer acknowledgements, and defines failover algorithms
        and the associated state machine. This is described in Section 5.5
        and
        <xref target="RFC3539" />.</t>
        <t hangText="Transmission-level security">
        <vspace blankLines="1" />
        <xref target="RFC2865" /> defines an application-layer authentication
        and integrity scheme that is required only for use with Response
        packets. While
        <xref target="RFC2869" /> defines an additional authentication and
        integrity mechanism, use is only required during Extensible
        Authentication Protocol (EAP) sessions. While attribute-hiding is
        supported,
        <xref target="RFC2865" /> does not provide support for per-packet
        confidentiality. In accounting,
        <xref target="RFC2866" /> assumes that replay protection is provided
        by the backend billing server, rather than within the protocol
        itself.
        <vspace blankLines="1" />While <xref target="RFC3162"/> defines the 
        use of IPsec with RADIUS, support for IPsec is not required. 
        In order to provide universal support for transmission-level
        security, and enable both intra- and inter-domain AAA deployments,
        Diameter provides support for TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP. Security is discussed in Section 13.
        <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
        <t hangText="Reliable transport">
        <vspace blankLines="1" />
        <vspace blankLines="1" />RADIUS runs over UDP, and does not define
        retransmission behavior; as a result, reliability varies between
        implementations. As described in
        <xref target="RFC2975" />, this is a major issue in accounting, where
        packet loss may translate directly into revenue loss. In order to
        provide well defined transport behavior, Diameter runs over reliable
        transport mechanisms (TCP, SCTP) as defined in <xref target="RFC3539" />.
        <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
        <t hangText="Agent support">
        <vspace blankLines="1" />
        <xref target="RFC2865" /> does not provide for explicit support for
        agents, including Proxies, Redirects and Relays. Since the expected
        behavior is not defined, it varies between implementations. Diameter
        defines agent behavior explicitly; this is described in Section 2.8.
        <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
        <t hangText="Server-initiated messages">
        <vspace blankLines="1" />While RADIUS server-initiated messages are
        defined in
        <xref target="RFC5176" />, support is optional. This makes it
        difficult to implement features such as unsolicited disconnect or
        re-authentication/re-authorization on demand across a heterogeneous
        deployment. To tackle this issue, support for server-initiated messages 
        is mandatory in Diameter.
        <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
        <t hangText="Transition support">
        <vspace blankLines="1" />While Diameter does not share a common
        protocol data unit (PDU) with RADIUS, considerable effort has been
        expended in enabling backward compatibility with RADIUS, so that the
        two protocols may be deployed in the same network. Initially, it is
        expected that Diameter will be deployed within new network devices,
        as well as within gateways enabling communication between legacy
        RADIUS devices and Diameter agents. This capability enables Diameter 
        support to be added to legacy networks, by addition of a gateway or 
        server speaking both RADIUS and Diameter.
        <vspace blankLines="1" />In addition to addressing the above
        requirements, Diameter also provides support for the following:
        <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
        <t hangText="Capability negotiation">
        <vspace blankLines="1" />RADIUS does not support error messages,
        capability negotiation, or a mandatory/non-mandatory flag for
        attributes. Since RADIUS clients and servers are not aware of each
        other's capabilities, they may not be able to successfully negotiate
        a mutually acceptable service, or in some cases, even be aware of
        what service has been implemented. Diameter includes support for
        error handling (Section 7), capability negotiation (Section 5.3), and
        mandatory/non-mandatory Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs) (Section 4.1).
        <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
        <t hangText="Peer discovery and configuration">
        <vspace blankLines="1" />RADIUS implementations typically require
        that the name or address of servers or clients be manually
        configured, along with the corresponding shared secrets. This results
        in a large administrative burden, and creates the temptation to reuse
        the RADIUS shared secret, which can result in major security
        vulnerabilities if the Request Authenticator is not globally and
        temporally unique as required in
        <xref target="RFC2865" />. Through DNS, Diameter enables dynamic
        discovery of peers (see <xref target="PeerDis"/>). Derivation of dynamic session keys is enabled via
        transmission-level security.
        <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
      </list></t>
      <t>Over time, the capabilities of Network Access Server (NAS) devices
      have increased substantially. As a result, while Diameter is a considerably 
      more sophisticated protocol than RADIUS, it remains feasible to implement 
      it within embedded devices.</t>
      <section anchor="Protocol" title="Diameter Protocol">
        <t>The Diameter base protocol provides the following facilities:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Ability to exchange messages and deliver AVPs</t>
          <t>Capabilities negotiation</t>
          <t>Error notification</t>
          <t>Extensibility, through addition of new applications, commands and AVPs
          (required in
          <xref target="RFC2989" />).</t>
          <t>Basic services necessary for applications, such as handling of
          user sessions or accounting</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>All data delivered by the protocol is in the form of AVPs. Some
        of these AVP values are used by the Diameter protocol itself, while
        others deliver data associated with particular applications that
        employ Diameter. AVPs may be arbitrarily added to Diameter messages, 
        the only restriction being that the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF, 
        <xref target="RFC5234" />) Command Code syntax specification (Section 3.2) is satisfied.
        AVPs are used by the base Diameter protocol to support the following required features:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Transporting of user authentication information, for the
          purposes of enabling the Diameter server to authenticate the
          user.</t>
          <t>Transporting of service-specific authorization information,
          between client and servers, allowing the peers to decide whether a
          user's access request should be granted.</t>
          <t>Exchanging resource usage information, which may be used for
          accounting purposes, capacity planning, etc.</t>
          <t>Routing, relaying, proxying and redirecting of Diameter messages through
          a server hierarchy.</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>The Diameter base protocol satisfies the minimum requirements
        for an AAA protocol, as specified by
        <xref target="RFC2989" />. The base protocol may be used by itself
        for accounting purposes only, or it may be used with a Diameter
        application, such as Mobile IPv4
        <xref target="RFC4004" />, or network access
        <xref target="RFC4005" />. It is also possible for the base protocol
        to be extended for use in new applications, via the addition of new
        commands or AVPs. The initial focus of Diameter was network
        access and accounting applications. A truly generic AAA protocol used
        by many applications might provide functionality not provided by
        Diameter. Therefore, it is imperative that the designers of new
        applications understand their requirements before using Diameter. See
        Section 2.4 for more information on Diameter applications.</t>
        <t>Any node can initiate a request. In that sense, Diameter is a
        peer- to-peer protocol. In this document, a Diameter Client is a
        device at the edge of the network that performs access control, such
        as a Network Access Server (NAS) or a Foreign Agent (FA). A Diameter
        client generates Diameter messages to request authentication,
        authorization, and accounting services for the user. A Diameter agent
        is a node that does not provide local user authentication or
        authorization services; agents include proxies, redirects and relay
        agents. A Diameter server performs authentication and/or authorization
        of the user. A Diameter node may act as an agent for certain requests
        while acting as a server for others.</t>
        <t>The Diameter protocol also supports server-initiated messages,
        such as a request to abort service to a particular user.</t>
        <section anchor="desc" title="Description of the Document Set">
          <t>The Diameter specification consists of an updated
          version of the base protocol specification (this document) and the
          Transport Profile <xref target="RFC3539" />. This document obsoletes
          RFC 3588. A summary of the base protocol updates included in
          this document can be found in <xref target="updates" />.</t>
          <t>This document defines the base protocol
          specification for AAA, which includes support for accounting. There are
          also a myriad of applications documents describing applications that use
          this base specification for Authentication, Authorization and Accounting.
          These application documents specify how to use the Diameter protocol within
          the context of their application.</t>
          <t>The Transport Profile document
          <xref target="RFC3539" /> discusses transport layer issues that
          arise with AAA protocols and recommendations on how to overcome
          these issues. This document also defines the Diameter failover
          algorithm and state machine.</t>
          <t>Clarifications on the Routing of Diameter Request based on
          Username and the Realm <xref target="RFC5729" /> defines specific
          behavior on how to route request based on the content of the User-Name
          AVP (Attribute Value Pair). </t>

        <section anchor="updates" title="Changes from RFC3588">
         <t>This document obsoletes RFC 3588 but is fully backward
         compatible with that document. The changes introduced in this document
         focus on fixing issues that have surfaced during implementation of
         <xref target="RFC3588"/>. An overview of some the major changes are given below.
         </t><t>
         <list style="symbols">
           <t>Deprecated the use of Inband-Security AVP for negotiating transport layer
           security. It has been generally considered that bootstrapping of TLS via
           Inband-Security AVP creates certain security risk because it does not
           completely protect the information carried in the CER (Capabilities Exchange
           Request)/CEA (Capabilities Exchange Answer). This version
           of Diameter adopted a common approach of defining a well-known secured port
           that peers should use when communicating via TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP. This new approach augments the
           existing Inband-Security negotiation but does not completely replace it. 
           The old method is kept for backwards compatibility reasons.</t>
           <t>Deprecated the exchange of CER/CEA messages in the open state. This feature
           was implied in the peer state machine table of <xref target="RFC3588"/> but it
           was not clearly defined anywhere else in that document. As work on this document
           progressed, it became clear that the multiplicity of meaning and use of Application Id
           AVPs in the CER/CEA messages (and the messages themselves) is seen as an abuse
           of the Diameter extensibility rules and thus required simplification. It is assumed that
           the capabilities exchange in the open state will be re-introduced in a separate
           specification which clearly defines new commands for this feature.</t>
           <t>Simplified Security Requirements. The use of a secured transport for
           exchanging Diameter messages remains mandatory. However, TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP has become
           the primary method of securing Diameter and IPsec is a secondary alternative.
           See <xref target="seccons"/> for details. The support for the End-to-End security 
           framework (E2ESequence AVP and 'P'-bit in the AVP header) has also been deprecated.</t>
           <t>Diameter Extensibility Changes. This includes fixes to the Diameter extensibility
           description (<xref target="ext"/> and others) to better aid Diameter application designers;
           in addition, the new specification relaxes the policy with respect to the allocation of
           command codes for vendor-specific uses.</t>
           <t>Application Id Usage. Clarify the proper use of Application Id information
           which can be found in multiple places within a Diameter message. This includes
           correlating Application Ids found in the message headers and AVPs.
           These changes also clearly specify the proper Application Id value to use
           for specific base protocol messages (ASR/ASA, STR/STA) as well as clarifying
           the content and use of Vendor-Specific-Application-Id.</t>
           <t>Routing Fixes.  This document more clearly specifies what information 
           (AVPs and Application Id) can be used for making general routing decisions.
           A rule for the prioritization of redirect routing criteria when multiple
           route entries are found via redirects has also been added (See Section 6.13 for details).</t>
           <t>Simplification of Diameter Peer Discovery. The Diameter discovery
           process now supports only widely used discovery schemes; the rest have been

         </list>
         </t>
         <t>There are many other many miscellaneous fixes that have been
         introduced in this document that may not be considered significant but they are
         important nonetheless. Examples are removal of obsolete types, fixes to
         command ABNFs, fixes to the state machine, clarification of the election process,
         message validation, fixes to Failed-AVP and Result-Code AVP values, etc. A comprehensive
         list of changes is not shown here for practical reasons.

            <vspace blankLines="1" />A Diameter Client is a Diameter Node that
            supports Diameter client applications as well as the base protocol.
            Diameter Clients are often implemented in devices situated at the
            edge of a network and provide access control services for that network.
            Typical examples of Diameter Clients include the Network Access Server

            handles authentication, authorization and accounting requests for
            a particular realm. By its very nature, a Diameter Server must
            support Diameter server applications in addition to the base protocol.

            <vspace blankLines="1" />An interim accounting message
            provides a snapshot of usage during a user's session. It is
            typically implemented in order to provide for partial accounting
            of a user's session in the case a device reboot or other
            network problem prevents the delivery of a session summary
            message or session record.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
            <t hangText="Local Realm">
            <vspace blankLines="1" />A local realm is the administrative
            domain providing services to a user. An administrative domain may
            act as a local realm for certain users, while being a home realm
            for others.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
            <t hangText="Multi-session">
            <vspace blankLines="1" />A multi-session represents a logical
            linking of several sessions. Multi-sessions are tracked by using
            the Acct-Multi-Session-Id. An example of a multi-session would be
            a Multi-link PPP bundle. Each leg of the bundle would be a
            session while the entire bundle would be a multi-session.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
            <t hangText="Network Access Identifier">
            <vspace blankLines="1" />The Network Access
            Identifier, or NAI
            <xref target="RFC4282" />, is used in the Diameter protocol to
            extract a user's identity and realm. The identity is used to
            identify the user during authentication and/or authorization,
            while the realm is used for message routing purposes.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
            <t hangText="Proxy Agent or Proxy">
            <vspace blankLines="1" />In addition to forwarding
            requests and responses, proxies make policy decisions relating to
            resource usage and provisioning. This is typically accomplished
            by tracking the state of NAS devices. While proxies typically do
            not respond to client Requests prior to receiving a Response from
            the server, they may originate Reject messages in cases where
            policies are violated. As a result, proxies need to understand
            the semantics of the messages passing through them, and may not
            support all Diameter applications.

            <vspace blankLines="1" />The string in the NAI that immediately
            follows the '@' character. NAI realm names are required to be
            unique, and are piggybacked on the administration of the DNS
            namespace. Diameter makes use of the realm, also loosely referred
            to as domain, to determine whether messages can be satisfied
            locally, or whether they must be routed or redirected. In RADIUS,
            realm names are not necessarily piggybacked on the DNS namespace
            but may be independent of it.

            <t hangText="Real-time Accounting">
            <vspace blankLines="1" />Real-time accounting involves
            the processing of information on resource usage within a defined
            time window. Time constraints are typically imposed in order to
            limit financial risk. The Diameter Credit Control Application
            <xref target="RFC4006" /> is an example of an application that defines
            real-time accounting functionality.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
            <t hangText="Relay Agent or Relay">
            <vspace blankLines="1" />Relays forward requests and
            responses based on routing-related AVPs and routing table
            entries. Since relays do not make policy decisions, they do not
            examine or alter non-routing AVPs. As a result, relays never
            originate messages, do not need to understand the semantics of
            messages or non-routing AVPs, and are capable of handling any
            Diameter application or message type. Since relays make decisions
            based on information in routing AVPs and realm forwarding tables
            they do not keep state on NAS resource usage or sessions in
            progress.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
            <t hangText="Redirect Agent">
            <vspace blankLines="1" />Rather than forwarding requests and
            responses between clients and servers, redirect agents refer
            clients to servers and allow them to communicate directly. Since
            redirect agents do not sit in the forwarding path, they do not
            alter any AVPs transiting between client and server. Redirect
            agents do not originate messages and are capable of handling any
            message type, although they may be configured only to redirect
            messages of certain types, while acting as relay or proxy agents
            for other types. As with proxy agents, redirect agents do not
            keep state with respect to sessions or NAS resources.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
            <t hangText="Session">
            <vspace blankLines="1" />A session is a related progression of
            events devoted to a particular activity. Diameter application
            documents provide guidelines as to when a session begins and ends. All
            Diameter packets with the same Session-Id are considered to be
            part of the same session.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
            <t hangText="Stateful Agent">
            <vspace blankLines="1" />A stateful agent is one that
            maintains session state information, by keeping track of all
            authorized active sessions. Each authorized session is bound to a
            particular service, and its state is considered active either
            until it is notified otherwise, or by expiration.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
            <t hangText="Sub-session">
            <vspace blankLines="1" />A sub-session represents a distinct
            service (e.g., QoS or data characteristics) provided to a given
            session. These services may happen concurrently (e.g.,
            simultaneous voice and data transfer during the same session) or
            serially. These changes in sessions are tracked with the
            Accounting-Sub-Session-Id.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
            <t hangText="Transaction state">
            <vspace blankLines="1" />The Diameter protocol requires
            that agents maintain transaction state, which is used for
            failover purposes. Transaction state implies that upon forwarding
            a request, the Hop-by-Hop identifier is saved; the field is
            replaced with a locally unique identifier, which is restored to
            its original value when the corresponding answer is received. The
            request's state is released upon receipt of the answer. A
            stateless agent is one that only maintains transaction state.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
            <t hangText="Translation Agent">
            <vspace blankLines="1" />A translation agent is a
            stateful Diameter node that performs protocol translation between
            Diameter and another AAA protocol, such as RADIUS.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
            <t hangText="Transport Connection">
            <vspace blankLines="1" />A transport connection is a
            TCP or SCTP connection existing directly between two Diameter
            peers, otherwise known as a Peer-to-Peer Connection.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
            <t hangText="Upstream">
            <vspace blankLines="1" />Upstream is used to identify the direction
            of a particular Diameter message from the Diameter Client towards
            the Home Server.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <vspace blankLines="1" />The entity or device requesting

      <section anchor="ext" title="Approach to Extensibility">
        <t>The Diameter protocol is designed to be extensible, using several
        mechanisms, including:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Defining new AVP values</t>
          <t>Creating new AVPs</t>
          <t>Creating new commands</t>
          <t>Creating new applications</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>From the point of view of extensibility Diameter authentication, authorization and
        accounting applications are treated in the same way.</t>
        <t>Note: Protocol designers should try to re-use existing functionality, namely
        AVP values, AVPs, commands, and Diameter applications. Reuse simplifies
        standardization and implementation. To avoid potential interoperability issues
        it is important to ensure that the semantics of the re-used features are well
        understood. Given that Diameter can also carry RADIUS attributes as Diameter AVPs,
        such re-use considerations apply also to existing RADIUS attributes that may be useful
        in a Diameter application.</t>
        <section anchor="define" title=" Defining New AVP Values">
          <t>In order to allocate a new AVP value for AVPs defined in the
          Diameter Base protocol, the IETF needs to approve a new RFC that
          describes the AVP value. IANA considerations for these AVP values
          are discussed in Section 11.4.</t>
          <t>The allocation of AVP values for other AVPs is guided by the IANA
          considerations of the document that defines those AVPs. Typically,
          allocation of new values for an AVP defined in an IETF RFC should
          require IETF Review <xref target="RFC5226" />, whereas values for
          vendor-specific AVPs can be allocated by the vendor.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="create" title=" Creating New AVPs">
          <t>A new AVP being defined MUST use one of the data types listed in
          Section 4.2 or Section 4.3. If an appropriate derived data type is already
          defined, it SHOULD be used instead of a base data type to encourage
          reusability and good design practice.</t>
          <t>In the event that a logical grouping of AVPs is necessary, and
          multiple "groups" are possible in a given command, it is
          recommended that a Grouped AVP be used (see Section 4.4).</t>
          <t>The creation of new AVPs can happen in various ways. The recommended
          approach is to define a new general-purpose AVP in a standards track RFC
          approved by the IETF. However, as described in Section 11.1.1 there are
          also other mechanisms.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="createcmd" title=" Creating New Commands">
          <t>A new Command Code MUST be allocated when required AVPs (those
          indicated as {AVP} in the ABNF definition) are added to, deleted from or
          redefined in (for example, by changing a required AVP into an optional 
          one) an existing command.</t>
          <t>Furthermore, if the transport characteristics of a command are changed
          (for example, with respect to the number of round trips required) a new Command
          Code MUST be registered.</t>
          <t>A change to the ABNF of a command, such as described above, MUST
          result in the definition of a new Command Code.  This subsequently
          leads to the need to define a new Diameter Application for any
          application that will use that new Command.</t>
          <t>The IANA considerations for commands are discussed in Section 11.2.1.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="acc" title=" Creating New Diameter Applications">
          <t>Every Diameter application specification MUST have an IANA assigned
           Application Id (see Section 2.4 and Section 11.3). The managed Application
           Id space is flat and there is no relationship between different Diameter
           applications with respect to their Application Ids. As such, there is no
           versioning support provided by these application Ids itself; every Diameter
           application is a standalone application. If the application has a relationship
           with other Diameter applications, such a relationship is not known to Diameter.</t>
           <t>Before describing the rules for creating new Diameter applications it
           is important to discuss the semantics of the AVPs occurrences as stated in
           the ABNF and the M-bit flag (Section 4.1) for an AVP. There is no relationship imposed
           between the two; they are set independently.</t>
           <list style="symbols">
              <t>The ABNF indicates what AVPs are placed into a Diameter Command by the 
              sender of that Command. Often, since there are multiple modes of protocol 
              interactions many of the AVPs are indicated as optional.</t>
              <t>The M-bit allows the sender to indicate to the receiver whether or not
              understanding the semantics of an AVP and its content is mandatory.
              If the M-bit is set by the sender and the receiver does not understand 
              the AVP or the values carried within that AVP then a failure is generated 
              (see Section 7).</t>
           </list>
           <t>It is the decision of the protocol designer when to develop a new 
           Diameter application rather than extending Diameter in other ways. However, 
           a new Diameter application MUST be created when one or more of the following
           criteria are met:</t>
           <vspace blankLines="1" />
           <list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="M-bit Setting"><vspace blankLines="1" />
              An AVP with the M-bit in the MUST column of the AVP flag table is added to
              an existing Command/Application.
              <vspace blankLines="1" />
              An AVP with the M-bit in the MAY column of the AVP flag table is added to
              an existing Command/Application.
              <vspace blankLines="1" />
              Note: The M-bit setting for a given AVP is relevant to an Application 
              and each command within that application which includes the AVP.
              That is, if an AVP appears in two commands for application Foo and the
              M-bit settings are different in each command, then there should be two AVP
              flag tables describing when to set the M-bit.
              </t>
              <t hangText="Commands"><vspace blankLines="1" />
              A new command is used within the existing application either because

    <section anchor="overview" title="Protocol Overview">
      <t>The base Diameter protocol concerns itself with establishing 
      connections to peers, capabilities negotiation, how messages are 
      sent and routed through peers, and how the connections are
      eventually torn down. The base protocol also defines certain rules
      that apply to all message exchanges between Diameter nodes.</t>
      <t>Communication between Diameter peers begins with one peer sending a
      message to another Diameter peer. The set of AVPs included in the
      message is determined by a particular Diameter application. One AVP
      that is included to reference a user's session is the Session-Id.</t>
      <t>The initial request for authentication and/or authorization of a
      user would include the Session-Id AVP. The Session-Id is then used in all
      subsequent messages to identify the user's session (see Section 8 for
      more information). The communicating party may accept the request, or
      reject it by returning an answer message with the Result-Code AVP set
      to indicate an error occurred. The specific behavior of the Diameter
      server or client receiving a request depends on the Diameter
      application employed.</t>
      <t>Session state (associated with a Session-Id) MUST be freed upon
      receipt of the Session-Termination-Request, Session-Termination-
      Answer, expiration of authorized service time in the Session-Timeout
      AVP, and according to rules established in a particular Diameter
      application.</t>
      <t>The base Diameter protocol may be used by itself for accounting
      applications. For authentication and authorization, it is
      always extended for a particular application.</t>
      <t>Diameter Clients MUST support the base protocol, which includes
      accounting. In addition, they MUST fully support each Diameter
      application that is needed to implement the client's service, e.g.,
      NASREQ and/or Mobile IPv4. A Diameter Client MUST be referred to as
      "Diameter X Client" where X is the application which it supports, 
      and not a "Diameter Client".</t>
      <t>Diameter Servers MUST support the base protocol, which includes
      accounting. In addition, they MUST fully support each Diameter
      application that is needed to implement the intended service, e.g.,
      NASREQ and/or Mobile IPv4. A Diameter Server MUST be referred to as
      "Diameter X Server" where X is the application which it supports, 
      and not a "Diameter Server".</t>
      <t>Diameter Relays and redirect agents are transparent to the Diameter
      applications but they MUST support the Diameter base protocol, which 
      includes accounting, and all Diameter applications.</t>
      <t>Diameter proxies MUST support the base protocol, which includes
      accounting. In addition, they MUST fully support each Diameter
      application that is needed to implement proxied services, e.g., NASREQ
      and/or Mobile IPv4. A Diameter proxy MUST be referred to as 
      "Diameter X Proxy" where X is the application which it supports, and
      not a "Diameter Proxy".</t>
      <section anchor="trans" title="Transport">
        <t>The Diameter Transport profile is defined in
        <xref target="RFC3539" />.</t>
        <t>The base Diameter protocol is run on port 3868 for both TCP
        <xref target="RFC793" /> and SCTP <xref target="RFC4960" />. For TLS
        <xref target="RFC5246" /> and DTLS <xref target="RFC4347" />, 
        a Diameter node that initiate a connection
        prior to any message exchanges MUST run on port [TBD]. It is assumed that
        TLS is run on top of TCP when it is used and DTLS is run on top of SCTP
        when it is used.</t>`
        <t>If the Diameter peer does not support receiving TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP connections
        on port [TBD], i.e. the peer complies only with <xref target="RFC3588"/>,
        then the initiator MAY revert to using TCP or SCTP and on port 3868.
        Note that this scheme is kept for the purpose of backwards compatibility only 
        and that there are inherent security vulnerabilities when the initial CER/CEA
        messages are sent un-protected (see <xref target="peerst"/>).</t>
        <t>Diameter clients MUST support either TCP or SCTP, while agents and
        servers SHOULD support both.</t>
        <t>A Diameter node MAY initiate connections from a source port other
        than the one that it declares it accepts incoming connections on, and
        MUST be prepared to receive connections on port 3868 for TCP or SCTP
        and port [TBD] for TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP connections. A given
        Diameter instance of the peer state machine MUST NOT use more than
        one transport connection to communicate with a given peer, unless
        multiple instances exist on the peer in which case a separate
        connection per process is allowed.</t>
        <t>When no transport connection exists with a peer, an attempt to
        connect SHOULD be periodically made. This behavior is handled via the
        Tc timer (see <xref target="diprcpa"/> for details), whose recommended 
        value is 30 seconds. There are certain exceptions to this rule, such as
        when a peer has terminated the transport connection stating that it
        does not wish to communicate.</t>
        <t>When connecting to a peer and either zero or more transports are
        specified, TLS SHOULD be tried first, followed by DTLS, then by TCP 
        and finally by SCTP. See Section
        5.2 for more information on peer discovery.</t>
        <t>Diameter implementations SHOULD be able to interpret ICMP protocol
        port unreachable messages as explicit indications that the server is
        not reachable, subject to security policy on trusting such messages.
        Further guidance regarding the treatment of ICMP errors can be found
        in <xref target="RFC5927"/> and <xref target="RFC5461"/>.
        Diameter implementations SHOULD also be able to interpret a reset
        from the transport and timed-out connection attempts. If Diameter 
        receives data from the lower layer that cannot be parsed or identified 
        as a Diameter error made by the peer, the stream is compromised and cannot
        be recovered. The transport connection MUST be closed using a RESET
        call (send a TCP RST bit) or an SCTP ABORT message (graceful closure
        is compromised).</t>
        <section anchor="sctp" title="SCTP Guidelines">
          <t>Diameter messages SHOULD be mapped into SCTP streams in 
          a way that avoids head-of-the-line (HOL) blocking. Among 
          different ways of performing the mapping that fulfill this 
          requirement it is RECOMMENDED that a Diameter node sends every 
          Diameter message (request or response) over the stream zero with 
          the unordered flag set. However, Diameter nodes MAY select and 
          implement other design alternatives for avoiding HOL blocking 
          such as using multiple streams with the unordered flag cleared
          (as originally instructed in RFC3588). On the receiving side, a 
          Diameter entity MUST be ready to receive Diameter messages over 
          any stream and it is free to return responses over a different  
          stream. This way, both sides manage the available streams in the 
          sending direction, independently of the streams chosen by the other 
          side to send a particular Diameter message. These messages can be 
          out-of-order and belong to different Diameter sessions.
          </t>
          <t>Out-of-order delivery has special concerns during a connection 
          establishment and termination. When a connection is established, the
          responder side sends a CEA message and moves to R-Open state as 
          specified in Section 5.6. If an application message is sent shortly 
          after the CEA and delivered out-of-order, the initiator side, still 
          in Wait-I-CEA state, will discard the application message and close 
          the connection. In order to avoid this race condition, the receiver 
          side SHOULD NOT use out-of-order delivery methods until the first 
          message has been received from the initiator, proving that it has moved 
          to I-Open state. To trigger such message, the receiver side could send 
          a DWR immediatly after sending CEA. Upon reception of the corresponding 
          DWA, the receiver side should start using out-of-order delivery methods 
          to counter the HOL blocking.
          </t>
          <t>Another race condition may occur when DPR and DPA messages are 
          used. Both DPR and DPA are small in size, thus they may be delivered 
          faster to the peer than application messages when out-of-order delivery
          mechanism is used. Therefore, it is possible that a DPR/DPA exchange 
          completes while application messages are still in transit, resulting 
          to a loss of these messages. An implementation could mitigate this race 
          condition, for example, using timers and wait for a short period of time 
          for pending application level messages to arrive before proceeding to 
          disconnect the transport connection. Eventually, lost messages are handled 
          by the retransmission mechanism described in Section 5.5.4.

      <section anchor="sec" title="Securing Diameter Messages">
        <t>Connections between Diameter peers SHOULD be protected by TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP.
        All Diameter base protocol implementations MUST support the use of TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP.
        If desired, alternative security mechanisms that are independent
        of Diameter, such as IPsec <xref target="RFC4301"/>, can be deployed 
        to secure connections between peers. The Diameter protocol
        MUST NOT be used without any security mechanism.</t>

      <section anchor="comp" title="Diameter Application Compliance">
        <t>Application Ids are advertised during the capabilities
        exchange phase (see Section 5.3). Advertising support of an application
        implies that the sender supports the functionality
        specified in the respective Diameter application specification.</t>
        <t>Implementations MAY add arbitrary optional AVPs with the M-bit
        cleared (including vendor-specific AVPs) to a command defined in an    
        application, but only if the command's ABNF syntax specification 
        allows for it. Please refer to Section 11.1.1 for details.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="appl" title="Application Identifiers">
        <t>Each Diameter application MUST have an IANA assigned Application
        Id (see Section 11.3). The base protocol does not require an
        Application Id since its support is mandatory. During the
        capabilities exchange, Diameter nodes inform their peers of locally
        supported applications. Furthermore, all Diameter messages contain an
        Application Id, which is used in the message forwarding
        process.</t>
        <t>The following Application Id values are defined:
        <artwork>
      Diameter Common Messages      0
      Diameter Base Accounting      3
      Relay                         0xffffffff
        </artwork>
        </t>
        <t>Relay and redirect agents MUST advertise the Relay Application
        Identifier, while all other Diameter nodes MUST advertise locally
        supported applications. The receiver of a Capabilities Exchange
        message advertising Relay service MUST assume that the sender
        supports all current and future applications.</t>
        <t>Diameter relay and proxy agents are responsible for finding an
        upstream server that supports the application of a particular
        message. If none can be found, an error message is returned with the

      <section anchor="conn" title="Connections vs. Sessions">
        <t>This section attempts to provide the reader with an understanding
        of the difference between connection and session, which are terms
        used extensively throughout this document.</t>
        <t>A connection refers to a transport level connection between two peers
        that is used to send and receive Diameter messages. A session is a logical
        concept at the application layer existing between the Diameter client and 
        the Diameter server; it is identified via the Session-Id AVP.</t>

        </t>
        <t>In the example provided in <xref target="Figure1" />, peer connection
        A is established between the Client and the Relay.  Peer connection B is
        established between the Relay and the Server.  User session X spans
        from the Client via the Relay to the Server.  Each "user" of a
        service causes an auth request to be sent, with a unique session
        identifier. Once accepted by the server, both the client and the
        server are aware of the session.</t>
        <t>It is important to note that there is no relationship between a
        connection and a session, and that Diameter messages for multiple
        sessions are all multiplexed through a single connection. Also note
        that Diameter messages pertaining to the session, both application
        specific and those that are defined in this document such as ASR/ASA,
        RAR/RAA and STR/STA MUST carry the Application Id of the
        application. Diameter messages pertaining to peer connection
        establishment and maintenance such as CER/CEA, DWR/DWA and
        DPR/DPA MUST carry an Application Id of zero (0).</t>

      </section>
      <section anchor="role" title="Role of Diameter Agents">
        <t>In addition to clients and servers, the Diameter protocol
        introduces relay, proxy, redirect, and translation agents, each of
        which is defined in Section 1.3. These Diameter agents are useful for
        several reasons:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>They can distribute administration of systems to a configurable
          grouping, including the maintenance of security associations.</t>
          <t>They can be used for concentration of requests from an number of
          co-located or distributed NAS equipment sets to a set of like user
          groups.</t>
          <t>They can do value-added processing to the requests or
          responses.</t>
          <t>They can be used for load balancing.</t>
          <t>A complex network will have multiple authentication sources,
          they can sort requests and forward towards the correct target.</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>The Diameter protocol requires that agents maintain transaction
        state, which is used for failover purposes. Transaction state implies
        that upon forwarding a request, its Hop-by-Hop identifier is saved;
        the field is replaced with a locally unique identifier, which is
        restored to its original value when the corresponding answer is
        received. The request's state is released upon receipt of the answer.
        A stateless agent is one that only maintains transaction state.</t>
        <t>The Proxy-Info AVP allows stateless agents to add local state to a
        Diameter request, with the guarantee that the same state will be
        present in the answer. However, the protocol's failover procedures
        require that agents maintain a copy of pending requests.</t>
        <t>A stateful agent is one that maintains session state information
        by keeping track of all authorized active sessions. Each authorized
        session is bound to a particular service, and its state is considered
        active either until the agent is notified otherwise, or the session expires.
        Each authorized session has an expiration, which is communicated by
        Diameter servers via the Session-Timeout AVP.</t>
        <t>Maintaining session state may be useful in certain applications,
        such as:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Protocol translation (e.g., RADIUS &lt;-&gt; Diameter)</t>
          <t>Limiting resources authorized to a particular user</t>
          <t>Per user or transaction auditing</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>A Diameter agent MAY act in a stateful manner for some requests
        and be stateless for others. A Diameter implementation MAY act as one
        type of agent for some requests, and as another type of agent for
        others.</t>
        <section anchor="relay" title="Relay Agents">
          <t>Relay Agents are Diameter agents that accept requests and route
          messages to other Diameter nodes based on information found in the
          messages (e.g., Destination-Realm). This routing decision is
          performed using a list of supported realms, and known peers. This
          is known as the Routing Table, as is defined further in
          Section 2.7.</t>
          <t>Relays may, for example, be used to aggregate requests from multiple
          Network Access Servers (NASes) within a common geographical area (POP).
          The use of Relays is advantageous since it eliminates the need for
          NASes to be configured with the necessary security information they
          would otherwise require to communicate with Diameter servers in
          other realms. Likewise, this reduces the configuration load on
          Diameter servers that would otherwise be necessary when NASes are
          added, changed or deleted.</t>
          <t>Relays modify Diameter messages by inserting and removing
          routing information, but do not modify any other portion of a
          message. Relays SHOULD NOT maintain session state but MUST maintain
          transaction state.

          <t>The example provided in <xref target="Figure2" /> depicts a request issued from
          NAS, which is an access device, for the user bob@example.com. Prior
          to issuing the request, NAS performs a Diameter route lookup, using
          "example.com" as the key, and determines that the message is to be
          relayed to DRL, which is a Diameter Relay. DRL performs the same
          route lookup as NAS, and relays the message to HMS, which is
          example.com's Home Diameter Server. HMS identifies that the request
          can be locally supported (via the realm), processes the
          authentication and/or authorization request, and replies with an
          answer, which is routed back to NAS using saved transaction
          state.</t>
          <t>Since Relays do not perform any application level processing,
          they provide relaying services for all Diameter applications, and
          therefore MUST advertise the Relay Application Id.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="PA" title="Proxy Agents">
          <t>Similarly to relays, proxy agents route Diameter messages using
          the Diameter Routing Table. However, they differ since they modify
          messages to implement policy enforcement. This requires that
          proxies maintain the state of their downstream peers (e.g., access
          devices) to enforce resource usage, provide admission control, and
          provisioning.</t>
          <t>Proxies may, for example, be used in call control centers or access ISPs that
          provide outsourced connections, they can monitor the number and
          types of ports in use, and make allocation and admission decisions
          according to their configuration.</t>
          <t>Since enforcing policies requires an understanding of the
          service being provided, Proxies MUST only advertise the Diameter
          applications they support.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="RA" title="Redirect Agents">
          <t>Redirect agents are useful in scenarios where the Diameter
          routing configuration needs to be centralized. An example is a
          redirect agent that provides services to all members of a
          consortium, but does not wish to be burdened with relaying all
          messages between realms. This scenario is advantageous since it
          does not require that the consortium provide routing updates to its
          members when changes are made to a member's infrastructure.</t>
          <t>Since redirect agents do not relay messages, and only return an
          answer with the information necessary for Diameter agents to
          communicate directly, they do not modify messages. Since redirect
          agents do not receive answer messages, they cannot maintain session
          state.</t>
          <t>The example provided in <xref target="Figure3" /> depicts a request issued from
          the access device, NAS, for the user bob@example.com. The message
          is forwarded by the NAS to its relay, DRL, which does not have a
          routing entry in its Diameter Routing Table for example.com. DRL
          has a default route configured to DRD, which is a redirect agent
          that returns a redirect notification to DRL, as well as HMS'
          contact information. Upon receipt of the redirect notification, DRL
          establishes a transport connection with HMS, if one doesn't already
          exist, and forwards the request to it.

          <t>Since redirect agents do not perform any application level

        <section anchor="TA" title="Translation Agents">
          <t>A translation agent is a device that provides translation
          between two protocols (e.g., RADIUS&lt;-&gt;Diameter,
          TACACS+&lt;-&gt;Diameter). Translation agents are likely to be
          used as aggregation servers to communicate with a Diameter
          infrastructure, while allowing for the embedded systems to be
          migrated at a slower pace.</t>
          <t>Given that the Diameter protocol introduces the concept of
          long-lived authorized sessions, translation agents MUST be session
          stateful and MUST maintain transaction state.</t>
          <t>Translation of messages can only occur if the agent recognizes
          the application of a particular request, and therefore translation
          agents MUST only advertise their locally supported applications.

      <section anchor="DPA" title="Diameter Path Authorization">
        <t>As noted in Section 2.2, Diameter provides transmission level
        security for each connection using TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP. Therefore, each connection can
        be authenticated, replay and integrity protected.</t>
        <t>In addition to authenticating each connection, each connection
        as well as the entire session MUST also be authorized. Before
        initiating a connection, a Diameter Peer MUST check that its peers
        are authorized to act in their roles. For example, a Diameter peer
        may be authentic, but that does not mean that it is authorized to
        act as a Diameter Server advertising a set of Diameter
        applications.</t>
        <t>Prior to bringing up a connection, authorization checks are
        performed at each connection along the path. Diameter capabilities
        negotiation (CER/CEA) also MUST be carried out, in order to
        determine what Diameter applications are supported by each peer.
        Diameter sessions MUST be routed only through authorized nodes that
        have advertised support for the Diameter application required by
        the session.</t>
        <t>As noted in Section 6.1.9, a relay or proxy agent MUST append a
        Route-Record AVP to all requests forwarded. The AVP contains the
        identity of the peer the request was received from.</t>
        <t>The home Diameter server, prior to authorizing a session, MUST
        check the Route-Record AVPs to make sure that the route traversed
        by the request is acceptable. For example, administrators within
        the home realm may not wish to honor requests that have been routed
        through an untrusted realm. By authorizing a request, the home
        Diameter server is implicitly indicating its willingness to engage
        in the business transaction as specified by the contractual
        relationship between the server and the previous hop. A
        DIAMETER_AUTHORIZATION_REJECTED error message (see Section 7.1.5)
        is sent if the route traversed by the request is unacceptable.</t>
        <t>A home realm may also wish to check that each accounting request
        message corresponds to a Diameter response authorizing the session.
        Accounting requests without corresponding authorization responses
        SHOULD be subjected to further scrutiny, as should accounting
        requests indicating a difference between the requested and provided
        service.</t>
        <t>Forwarding of an authorization response is considered
        evidence of a willingness to take on financial risk relative to the
        session. A local realm may wish to limit this exposure, for
        example, by establishing credit limits for intermediate realms and
        refusing to accept responses which would violate those limits. By
        issuing an accounting request corresponding to the authorization
        response, the local realm implicitly indicates its agreement to
        provide the service indicated in the authorization response. If the
        service cannot be provided by the local realm, then a
        DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY error message MUST be sent within the
        accounting request; a Diameter client receiving an authorization
        response for a service that it cannot perform MUST NOT substitute
        an alternate service, and then send accounting requests for the
        alternate service instead.</t>

      <section anchor="DCNC" title="Diameter Command Naming Conventions">
        <t>Diameter command names typically includes one or more English
        words followed by the verb Request or Answer. Each English word is
        delimited by a hyphen. A three-letter acronym for both the request
        and answer is also normally provided.</t>
        <t>An example is a message set used to terminate a session. The
        command name is Session-Terminate-Request and
        Session-Terminate-Answer, while the acronyms are STR and STA,
        respectively.</t>
        <t>Both the request and the answer for a given command share the same
        command code. The request is identified by the R(equest) bit in the
        Diameter header set to one (1), to ask that a particular action be
        performed, such as authorizing a user or terminating a session. Once
        the receiver has completed the request it issues the corresponding
        answer, which includes a result code that communicates one of the
        following:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>The request was successful</t>
          <t>The request failed</t>
          <t>An additional request has to be sent to provide information the
          peer requires prior to returning a successful or failed answer.</t>
          <t>The receiver could not process the request, but provides
          information about a Diameter peer that is able to satisfy the
          request, known as redirect.</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>Additional information, encoded within AVPs, may also be included
        in answer messages.

      authorization and routing information as well as
      configuration details for the request and reply.</t>
      <t>Each AVP of type OctetString MUST be padded to align on a 32-bit
      boundary, while other AVP types align naturally. A number of zero-
      valued bytes are added to the end of the AVP Data field till a word

            <vspace blankLines="1" />The AVP Code, combined with the Vendor-Id
            field, identifies the attribute uniquely. AVP numbers 1 through
            255 are reserved for re-use of RADIUS attributes, without
            setting the Vendor-Id field. AVP numbers 256 and above are used
            for Diameter, which are allocated by IANA (see Section 11.1).
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
            <t hangText="AVP Flags">
            <vspace blankLines="1" />The AVP Flags field informs the receiver
            how each attribute must be handled. The 'r' (reserved) bits are
            unused and SHOULD be set to 0. Note that subsequent Diameter
            applications MAY define additional bits within the AVP Header,
            and an unrecognized bit SHOULD be considered an error. The 'P' bit
            has been reserved for future usage of end-to-end security.
            At the time of writing there are no end-to-end security mechanisms 
            specified therefore the 'P' bit SHOULD be set to 0.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />The 'M' Bit, known as the Mandatory bit,
            indicates whether the receiver of the AVP MUST parse and understand
            the semantic of the AVP including its content. The receiving entity
            MUST return an appropriate error message if it receives an AVP
            that has the M-bit set but does not understand it. An exception
            applies when the AVP is embedded within a Grouped AVP. See
            Section 4.4 for details. Diameter Relay and redirect agents MUST
            NOT reject messages with unrecognized AVPs.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />The 'M' bit MUST be set according to the
            rules defined in the application specification which introduces or
            re-uses this AVP. Within a given application, the M-bit setting for
            an AVP is either defined for all command types or for each command
            type.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />AVPs with the 'M' bit cleared are
            informational only and a receiver that receives a message with
            such an AVP that is not supported, or whose value is not
            supported, MAY simply ignore the AVP.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />The 'V' bit, known as the
            Vendor-Specific bit, indicates whether the optional Vendor-ID
            field is present in the AVP header. When set the AVP Code belongs
            to the specific vendor code address space.</t>

            corresponds to the IETF adopted AVP values, as managed by the

            evaluation. Each packet is evaluated once. If no rule matches, the
            packet is dropped if the last rule evaluated was a permit, and
            passed if the last rule was a deny.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />IPFilterRule filters MUST follow the

            <artwork>
      action dir proto from src to dst [options]

      action       permit - Allow packets that match the rule.
                   deny   - Drop packets that match the rule.

      dir          "in" is from the terminal, "out" is to the
                   terminal.

      proto        An IP protocol specified by number.  The "ip"
                   keyword means any protocol will match.

      src and dst  &lt;address/mask&gt; [ports]

                   The &lt;address/mask&gt; may be specified as:
                   ipno       An IPv4 or IPv6 number in dotted-
                              quad or canonical IPv6 form.  Only
                              this exact IP number will match the
                              rule.
                   ipno/bits  An IP number as above with a mask
                              width of the form 192.0.2.10/24.  In
                              this case, all IP numbers from
                              192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255 will match.
                              The bit width MUST be valid for the
                              IP version and the IP number MUST
                              NOT have bits set beyond the mask.
                              For a match to occur, the same IP
                              version must be present in the
                              packet that was used in describing
                              the IP address.  To test for a
                              particular IP version, the bits part
                              can be set to zero.  The keyword
                              "any" is 0.0.0.0/0 or the IPv6
                              equivalent.  The keyword "assigned"
                              is the address or set of addresses
                              assigned to the terminal.  For IPv4,
                              a typical first rule is often "deny
                              in ip! assigned"

                   The sense of the match can be inverted by
                   preceding an address with the not modifier (!),
                   causing all other addresses to be matched
                   instead.  This does not affect the selection of
                   port numbers.

                   With the TCP, UDP and SCTP protocols, optional
                   ports may be specified as:

                      {port/port-port}[,ports[,...]]

                    The '-' notation specifies a range of ports
                   (including boundaries).

                   Fragmented packets that have a non-zero offset
                   (i.e., not the first fragment) will never match

                 offset.  See the frag option for details on
                 matching fragmented packets.

         icmptypes types
                 ICMP packets only.  Match if the ICMP type is in

   An Example-AVP with Grouped Data follows.

   The Origin-Host AVP is required (Section 6.3).  In this case:

      Origin-Host = "example.com".


   One or more Session-Ids must follow.  Here there are two:

      Session-Id =
        "grump.example.com:33041;23432;893;0AF3B81"

      Session-Id =

          <t>The data for the optional AVPs is represented in hex since the
          format of these AVPs is neither known at the time of definition of
          the Example-AVP group, nor (likely) at the time when the example
          instance of this AVP is interpreted - except by Diameter
          implementations which support the same set of AVPs. The encoding
          example illustrates how padding is used and how length fields are
          calculated. Also note that AVPs may be present in the Grouped AVP
          value which the receiver cannot interpret (here, the Recover-Policy
          and Futuristic-Acct-Record AVPs). The length of the Example-AVP
          is the sum of all the length of the member AVPs including their padding
          plus the Example-AVP header size.

    <section anchor="DPeers" title="Diameter Peers">
      <t>This section describes how Diameter nodes establish connections and
      communicate with peers.</t>
      <section anchor="PC" title="Peer Connections">
        <t>Connections between diameter peers are established using
        their valid DiameterIdentity. A Diameter node initiating a connection
        to a peer MUST know the peers DiameterIdentity. Methods for discovering
        a Diameter peer can be found in <xref target="PeerDis"/>.</t>
        <t>Although a Diameter node may have many possible peers that it is
        able to communicate with, it may not be economical to have an
        established connection to all of them. At a minimum, a Diameter node
        SHOULD have an established connection with two peers per realm, known
        as the primary and secondary peers. Of course, a node MAY have
        additional connections, if it is deemed necessary. Typically, all
        messages for a realm are sent to the primary peer, but in the event
        that failover procedures are invoked, any pending requests are sent
        to the secondary peer. However, implementations are free to load
        balance requests between a set of peers.</t>
        <t>Note that a given peer MAY act as a primary for a given realm,
        while acting as a secondary for another realm.</t>
        <t>When a peer is deemed suspect, which could occur for various
        reasons, including not receiving a DWA within an allotted timeframe,
        no new requests should be forwarded to the peer, but failover
        procedures are invoked. When an active peer is moved to this mode,
        additional connections SHOULD be established to ensure that the
        necessary number of active connections exists.</t>
        <t>There are two ways that a peer is removed from the suspect peer
        list:
        <vspace blankLines="1" />
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>The peer is no longer reachable, causing the transport
          connection to be shutdown. The peer is moved to the closed
          state.</t>
          <t>Three watchdog messages are exchanged with accepted round trip
          times, and the connection to the peer is considered stabilized.</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>In the event the peer being removed is either the primary or
        secondary, an alternate peer SHOULD replace the deleted peer, and
        assume the role of either primary or  secondary.</t>												
      </section>
      <section anchor="PeerDis" title="Diameter Peer Discovery">
        <t>Allowing for dynamic Diameter agent discovery will make it
        possible for simpler and more robust deployment of Diameter services.
        In order to promote interoperable implementations of Diameter peer
        discovery, the following mechanisms are described. These are based on
        existing IETF standards. The first option (manual configuration) MUST
        be supported by all Diameter nodes, while the latter option
        (DNS) MAY be supported.</t>
        <t>There are two cases where Diameter peer discovery may be
        performed. The first is when a Diameter client needs to discover a
        first-hop Diameter agent. The second case is when a Diameter agent
        needs to discover another agent - for further handling of a Diameter
        operation. In both cases, the following 'search order' is
        recommended:
        <vspace blankLines="1" />
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>The Diameter implementation consults its list of static
          (manually) configured Diameter agent locations. These will be used
          if they exist and respond.
          <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
          <t>The Diameter implementation performs a NAPTR query for a server
          in a particular realm. The Diameter implementation has to know in
          advance which realm to look for a Diameter agent. This could be
          deduced, for example, from the 'realm' in a NAI that a Diameter
          implementation needed to perform a Diameter operation on.
          <vspace blankLines="1" />
          The NAPTR usage in Diameter follows the S-NAPTR DDDS application
          <xref target="RFC3958"/> in which the SERVICE field includes 
          tags for the desired application and supported application protocol.
          The application service tag for a Diameter application is 'aaa' and
          the supported  application protocol tags are 'diameter.tcp',
          'diameter.sctp', 'diameter.dtls' or 'diameter.tls.tcp'.
          <vspace blankLines="1" />
          The client can follow the resolution process defined by the S-NAPTR
          DDDS <xref target="RFC3958"/> application to find a matching SRV,
          A or AAAA record of a suitable peer.  The domain suffixes in the 
          NAPTR replacement field SHOULD match the domain of the original query.
          An example can be found in <xref target="appNAPTR"/>.</t>
          <t>If no NAPTR records are found, the requester directly queries
          for SRV records '_diameter._sctp'.realm, '_diameter._dtls'.realm, 
          '_diameter._tcp'.realm and '_diameter._tls'.realm depending on the requesters network 
          protocol capabilities. If SRV records are found then the requester can perform address 
          record query (A RR's and/or AAAA RR's) for the target hostname specified
          in the SRV records. If no SRV records are found, the requester gives up.</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>If the server is using a site certificate,
        the domain name in the NAPTR query and the domain name in the
        replacement field MUST both be valid based on the site certificate handed 
        out by the server in the TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP or IKE exchange. Similarly, the domain
        name in the SRV query and the domain name in the target in the SRV
        record MUST both be valid based on the same site certificate.
        Otherwise, an attacker could modify the DNS records to contain
        replacement values in a different domain, and the client could not
        validate that this was the desired behavior, or the result of an
        attack.</t>
        <t>Also, the Diameter Peer MUST check to make
        sure that the discovered peers are authorized to act in its role.
        Authentication via IKE or TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP, or validation of DNS RRs via DNSSEC
        is not sufficient to conclude this. For example, a web server may
        have obtained a valid TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP certificate, and secured RRs may be
        included in the DNS, but this does not imply that it is authorized
        to act as a Diameter Server.</t>
        <t>Authorization can be achieved for example,
        by configuration of a Diameter Server CA. Alternatively this can be
        achieved by definition of OIDs within TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP or IKE certificates so as
        to signify Diameter Server authorization.</t>
        <t>A dynamically discovered peer causes an entry in the Peer Table
        (see Section 2.6) to be created. Note that entries created via DNS
        MUST expire (or be refreshed) within the DNS TTL. If a peer is
        discovered outside of the local realm, a routing table entry (see
        Section 2.7) for the peer's realm is created. The routing table
        entry's expiration MUST match the peer's expiration value.</t>

      <section anchor="CE" title="Capabilities Exchange">
        <t>When two Diameter peers establish a transport connection, they
        MUST exchange the Capabilities Exchange messages, as specified in the
        peer state machine (see Section 5.6). This message allows the
        discovery of a peer's identity and its capabilities (protocol version
        number, supported Diameter applications, security mechanisms,
        etc.)</t>
        <t>The receiver only issues commands to its peers that have
        advertised support for the Diameter application that defines the
        command. A Diameter node MUST cache the supported applications in
        order to ensure that unrecognized commands and/or AVPs are not
        unnecessarily sent to a peer.</t>
        <t>A receiver of a Capabilities-Exchange-Req (CER) message that does
        not have any applications in common with the sender MUST return a
        Capabilities-Exchange-Answer (CEA) with the Result-Code AVP set to
        DIAMETER_NO_COMMON_APPLICATION, and SHOULD disconnect the transport
        layer connection. Note that receiving a CER or CEA from a peer
        advertising itself as a Relay (see Section 2.4) MUST be interpreted
        as having common applications with the peer.</t>
        <t>The receiver of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request (CER) MUST
        determine common applications by computing the intersection of
        its own set of supported Application Id against all of the
        application identifier AVPs (Auth-Application-Id, Acct-Application-Id
        and Vendor-Specific-Application-Id) present in the CER. The value of
        the Vendor-Id AVP in the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id MUST NOT be
        used during computation. The sender of the Capabilities-Exchange-Answer (CEA)
        SHOULD include all of its supported applications as a hint to the
        receiver regarding all of its application capabilities.</t>
        <t>Diameter implementations SHOULD first attempt to establish a TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP 
        connection prior to the CER/CEA exchange. This protects the capabilities
        information of both peers. To support older Diameter implementations
        that do not fully conform to this document, the transport security MAY
        still be negotiated via Inband-Security AVP. In this case, the receiver
        of a Capabilities-Exchange-Req (CER) message that does not have any
        security mechanisms in common with the sender MUST return a 
        Capabilities-Exchange-Answer (CEA) with the Result-Code	
	AVP set to DIAMETER_NO_COMMON_SECURITY, and SHOULD disconnect the	
	transport layer connection.</t>
        <t>CERs received from unknown peers MAY be silently discarded, or a
        CEA MAY be issued with the Result-Code AVP set to
        DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_PEER. In both cases, the transport connection is
        closed. If the local policy permits receiving CERs from unknown
        hosts, a successful CEA MAY be returned. If a CER from an unknown
        peer is answered with a successful CEA, the lifetime of the peer
        entry is equal to the lifetime of the transport connection. In case
        of a transport failure, all the pending transactions destined to the
        unknown peer can be discarded.</t>
        <t>The CER and CEA messages MUST NOT be proxied, redirected or
        relayed.</t>
        <t>Since the CER/CEA messages cannot be proxied, it is still possible
        that an upstream agent receives a message for which it has no
        available peers to handle the application that corresponds to the
        Command-Code. In such instances, the 'E' bit is set in the answer
        message (see Section 7.) with the Result-Code AVP set to
        DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER to inform the downstream to take action
        (e.g., re-routing request to an alternate peer).</t>
        <t>With the exception of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request message, a
        message of type Request that includes the Auth-Application-Id or
        Acct-Application-Id AVPs, or a message with an application-specific
        command code, MAY only be forwarded to a host that has explicitly
        advertised support for the application (or has advertised the Relay

        has rebooted. In these cases, the peer may periodically attempt to
        reconnect, as stated in Section 2.1. In the event that the disconnect
        was a result of either a shortage of internal resources, or simply
        that the node in question has no intentions of forwarding any
        Diameter messages to the peer in the foreseeable future, a periodic
        connection request would not be welcomed. The Disconnection-Reason
        AVP contains the reason the Diameter node issued the

        so (e.g., message to be forwarded). Upon receipt of the message, the
        Disconnect-Peer-Answer is returned, which SHOULD contain an error if

        <section anchor="fail" title="Failover and Failback Procedures">
          <t>In the event that a transport failure is detected with a peer,
          it is necessary for all pending request messages to be forwarded to
          an alternate agent, if possible. This is commonly referred to as
          failover.</t>
          <t>In order for a Diameter node to perform failover procedures, it
          is necessary for the node to maintain a pending message queue for a
          given peer. When an answer message is received, the corresponding
          request is removed from the queue. The Hop-by-Hop Identifier field
          is used to match the answer with the queued request.</t>
          <t>When a transport failure is detected, if possible all messages
          in the queue are sent to an alternate agent with the T flag set. On
          booting a Diameter client or agent, the T flag is also set on any
          records still remaining to be transmitted in non-volatile storage.
          An example of a case where it is not possible to forward the
          message to an alternate server is when the message has a fixed
          destination, and the unavailable peer is the message's final
          destination (see Destination-Host AVP). Such an error requires that
          the agent return an answer message with the 'E' bit set and the
          Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER.</t>
          <t>It is important to note that multiple identical requests or
          answers MAY be received as a result of a failover. The End-to-End
          Identifier field in the Diameter header along with the Origin-Host
          AVP MUST be used to identify duplicate messages.</t>
          <t>As described in Section 2.1, a connection request should be
          periodically attempted with the failed peer in order to
          re-establish the transport connection. Once a connection has been
          successfully established, messages can once again be forwarded to
          the peer. This is commonly referred to as failback.</t>

      <section anchor="peerst" title="Peer State Machine">
        <t>This section contains a finite state machine that MUST be observed
        by all Diameter implementations. Each Diameter node MUST follow the
        state machine described below when communicating with each peer.
        Multiple actions are separated by commas, and may continue on
        succeeding lines, as space requires. Similarly, state and next state
        may also span multiple lines, as space requires.</t>
        <t>This state machine is closely coupled with the state machine
        described in
        <xref target="RFC3539" />, which is used to open, close, failover,
        probe, and reopen transport connections. Note in particular that
        <xref target="RFC3539" /> requires the use of watchdog messages to
        probe connections. For Diameter, DWR and DWA messages are to be
        used.</t>
        <t>I- is used to represent the initiator (connecting) connection,
        while the R- is used to represent the responder (listening)
        connection. The lack of a prefix indicates that the event or action
        is the same regardless of the connection on which the event
        occurred.</t>
        <t>The stable states that a state machine may be in are Closed,
        I-Open and R-Open; all other states are intermediate. Note that
        I-Open and R-Open are equivalent except for whether the initiator or
        responder transport connection is used for communication.</t>
        <t>A CER message is always sent on the initiating connection
        immediately after the connection request is successfully completed.
        In the case of an election, one of the two connections will shut
        down. The responder connection will survive if the Origin-Host of the
        local Diameter entity is higher than that of the peer; the initiator
        connection will survive if the peer's Origin-Host is higher. All
        subsequent messages are sent on the surviving connection. Note that
        the results of an election on one peer are guaranteed to be the
        inverse of the results on the other.</t>
        <t>For TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP usage, TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP handshake SHOULD begin when both ends are in
        the closed state prior to any Diameter message exchanges. The TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP 
        connection SHOULD be established before sending any CER or CEA message to
        secure and protect the capabilities information of both peers. The
        TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP connection SHOULD be disconnected when the state machine moves to
        the closed state.
        When connecting to responders that do not conform to this document
        (i.e. older Diameter implementations that are not prepared to received 
        TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP connections in the closed state), the initial TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP connection attempt 
        will fail. The initiator MAY then attempt to connect via TCP or SCTP and initiate
        the TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP handshake when both ends are in the open state. If the handshake
        is successful, all further messages will be sent via TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP. If the 
        handshake fails, both ends move to the closed state.</t>
        <t>The state machine constrains only the behavior of a Diameter
        implementation as seen by Diameter peers through events on the
        wire.</t>
        <t>Any implementation that produces equivalent results is considered
        compliant.

        <section anchor="inc" title="Incoming connections">
          <t>When a connection request is received from a Diameter peer, it
          is not, in the general case, possible to know the identity of that
          peer until a CER is received from it. This is because host and port
          determine the identity of a Diameter peer; and the source port of
          an incoming connection is arbitrary. Upon receipt of CER, the
          identity of the connecting peer can be uniquely determined from
          Origin-Host.</t>
          <t>For this reason, a Diameter peer must employ logic separate from
          the state machine to receive connection requests, accept them, and
          await CER. Once CER arrives on a new connection, the Origin-Host
          that identifies the peer is used to locate the state machine
          associated with that peer, and the new connection and CER are
          passed to the state machine as an R-Conn-CER event.</t>
          <t>The logic that handles incoming connections SHOULD close and
          discard the connection if any message other than CER arrives, or if
          an implementation-defined timeout occurs prior to receipt of
          CER.</t>
          <t>Because handling of incoming connections up to and including
          receipt of CER requires logic, separate from that of any individual
          state machine associated with a particular peer, it is described
          separately in this section rather than in the state machine
          above.</t>

        <section anchor="eve" title="Events">
          <t>Transitions and actions in the automaton are caused by events.

        <section anchor="elep" title="The Election Process">
          <t>The election is performed on the responder. The responder compares the
           Origin-Host received in the CER with its own Origin-Host as two streams
           of octets. If the local Origin-Host lexicographically succeeds
           the received Origin-Host a Win-Election event is issued locally.
           Diameter identities are in ASCII form therefore the lexical comparison is
           consistent with DNS case insensitivity where octets that fall in the ASCII
           range 'a' through 'z' MUST compare equally to their upper-case counterparts
           between 'A' and 'Z'. See <xref target="appIDNA" /> for interactions
           between the Diameter protocol and Internationalized Domain Name (IDNs).</t>
          <t>The winner of the election MUST close the connection it initiated.
           Historically, maintaining the responder side of a connection was more
           efficient than maintaining the initiator side. However, current practices
           makes this distinction irrelevant.</t>

    <section anchor="DMP" title="Diameter message processing">
      <t>This section describes how Diameter requests and answers are created
      and processed.</t>
      <section anchor="rout" title="Diameter Request Routing Overview">
        <t>A request is sent towards its final destination using a
        combination of the Destination-Realm and Destination-Host AVPs, in
        one of these three combinations:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>a request that is not able to be proxied (such as CER) MUST NOT
          contain either Destination-Realm or Destination-Host AVPs.</t>
          <t>a request that needs to be sent to a home server serving a
          specific realm, but not to a specific server (such as the first
          request of a series of round-trips), MUST contain a Destination-
          Realm AVP, but MUST NOT contain a Destination-Host AVP. For
          Diameter clients, the value of the Destination-Realm AVP MAY be
          extracted from the User-Name AVP, or other methods.</t>
          <t>otherwise, a request that needs to be sent to a specific home
          server among those serving a given realm, MUST contain both the
          Destination-Realm and Destination-Host AVPs.</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>The Destination-Host AVP is used as described above when the
        destination of the request is fixed, which includes:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Authentication requests that span multiple round trips</t>
          <t>A Diameter message that uses a security mechanism that makes use
          of a pre-established session key shared between the source and the
          final destination of the message.</t>
          <t>Server initiated messages that MUST be received by a specific
          Diameter client (e.g., access device), such as the Abort-Session-
          Request message, which is used to request that a particular user's
          session be terminated.</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>Note that an agent can forward a request to a host described in
        the Destination-Host AVP only if the host in question is included in
        its peer table (see Section 2.7). Otherwise, the request is routed
        based on the Destination-Realm only (see Sections 6.1.6).</t>
        <t>When a message is received, the message is processed in the
        following order:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>If the message is destined for the local host, the procedures
          listed in Section 6.1.4 are followed.</t>
          <t>If the message is intended for a Diameter peer with whom the
          local host is able to directly communicate, the procedures listed
          in Section 6.1.5 are followed. This is known as Request
          Forwarding.</t>
          <t>The procedures listed in Section 6.1.6 are followed, which is
          known as Request Routing.</t>
          <t>If none of the above is successful, an answer is returned with
          the Result-Code set to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER, with the E-bit
          set.</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>For routing of Diameter messages to work within an administrative
        domain, all Diameter nodes within the realm MUST be peers.</t>
        <t>Note the processing rules contained in this section are intended
        to be used as general guidelines to Diameter developers. Certain
        implementations MAY use different methods than the ones described
        here, and still comply with the protocol specification. See Section 7
        for more detail on error handling.</t>
        <section anchor="origi" title="Originating a Request">
          <t>When creating a request, in addition to any other procedures
          described in the application definition for that specific request,
          the following procedures MUST be followed:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>the Command-Code is set to the appropriate value</t>
            <t>the 'R' bit is set</t>

        </section>
        <section anchor="RR" title="Receiving Requests">
          <t>A relay or proxy agent MUST check for forwarding loops when

        <section anchor="RRo" title="Request Routing">
          <t>Diameter request message routing is done via realms and
          application identifiers. A Diameter message that may be forwarded by
          Diameter agents (proxies, redirect or relay agents) MUST include
          the target realm in the Destination-Realm AVP. Request
          routing SHOULD rely on the Destination-Realm AVP and the
          Application Id present in the request message header to
          aid in the routing decision. The realm MAY be retrieved from the
          User-Name AVP, which is in the form of a Network Access
          Identifier (NAI).  The realm portion of the NAI is inserted
          in the Destination-Realm AVP.</t>
          <t>Diameter agents MAY have a list of locally supported realms and
          applications, and MAY have a list of externally supported realms
          and applications. When a request is received that includes a realm
          and/or application that is not locally supported, the message is
          routed to the peer configured in the Routing Table (see
          Section 2.7).</t>
          <t>Realm names and Application Ids are the minimum supported
          routing criteria, additional information may be needed to support

          <t>Before forwarding or routing a request, Diameter agents, in

          for the presence of candidate route's peer identity in any
          of the Route-Record AVPs. In an event of the agent detecting
          the presence of a candidate route's peer identity in a
          Route-Record AVP, the agent MUST ignore such route for the
          Diameter request message and attempt alternate routes if any.
          In case all the candidate routes are eliminated by the above

          </figure></t>
          <t>The receiver of the answer message with the 'E' bit set, and the
          Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER_REDIRECT_INDICATION uses the
          hop-by- hop field in the Diameter header to identify the request in
          the pending message queue (see Section 5.3) that is to be
          redirected. If no transport connection exists with the new agent,
          one is created, and the request is sent directly to it.</t>
          <t>Multiple Redirect-Host AVPs are allowed. The receiver of the
          answer message with the 'E' bit set selects exactly one of these
          hosts as the destination of the redirected message.</t>
          <t>When the Redirect-Host-Usage AVP included in the answer message
          has a non-zero value, a route entry for the redirect indications
          is created and cached by the receiver. The redirect usage for such
          route entry is set by the value of Redirect-Host-Usage AVP and the
          lifetime of the cached route entry is set by Redirect-Max-Cache-Time
          AVP value.</t>
          <t>It is possible that multiple redirect indications can create multiple
          cached route entries differing only in their redirect usage and the peer
          to forward messages to. As an example, two(2) route entries that are created
          by two(2) redirect indications results in two(2) cached routes
          for the same realm and Application Id. However, one has a redirect
          usage of ALL_SESSION where matching request will be forwarded to one
          peer and the other has a redirect usage of ALL_REALM where request are
          forwarded to another peer. Therefore, an incoming request that matches
          the realm and Application Id of both routes will need additional resolution.
          In such a case, a routing precedence rule MUST be used against the redirect
          usage value to resolve the contention. The precedence rule can be found
          in Section 6.13.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="ReRr" title="Relaying and Proxying Requests">
          <t>A relay or proxy agent MUST append a Route-Record AVP to all
          requests forwarded. The AVP contains the identity of the peer the
          request was received from.</t>
          <t>The Hop-by-Hop identifier in the request is saved, and replaced
          with a locally unique value. The source of the request is also
          saved, which includes the IP address, port and protocol.</t>
          <t>A relay or proxy agent MAY include the Proxy-Info AVP in
          requests if it requires access to any local state information when
          the corresponding response is received. The Proxy-Info AVP has 
          security implications as state information is distribute to other
          entities. As such, it is RECOMMMENDED to protect the content of 
          the Proxy-Info AVP with cryptographic mechanisms, for example by
          using a keyed message digest. Such a mechanism, however, requires
          the management of keys, although only locally at the Diameter server.
          Still, a full description of the management of the keys used to protect
          the Proxy-Info AVP is beyond the scope of this document. Below is a
          list of commonly recommended:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>The keys should be generated securely following the randomness
            recommendations in <xref target="RFC4086"/>.</t>
            <t>The keys and cryptographic protection algorithms should be at
            least 128 bits in strength.</t>
            <t>The keys should not be used for any other purpose than generating
            and verifying tickets.</t>
            <t>The keys should be changed regularly.</t>
            <t>The keys should be changed if the ticket format or cryptographic
            protection algorithms change.</t>
          </list>
          </t>
          <t>The message is then forwarded to the next hop, as identified in
          the Routing Table.</t>

      <t>There are two different types of errors in Diameter; protocol and
      application errors. A protocol error is one that occurs at the base
      protocol level, and MAY require per hop attention (e.g., message
      routing error). Application errors, on the other hand, generally occur
      due to a problem with a function specified in a Diameter application
      (e.g., user authentication, missing AVP).</t>
      <t>Result-Code AVP values that are used to report protocol errors MUST
      only be present in answer messages whose 'E' bit is set. When a request
      message is received that causes a protocol error, an answer message is
      returned with the 'E' bit set, and the Result-Code AVP is set to the
      appropriate protocol error value. As the answer is sent back towards
      the originator of the request, each proxy or relay agent MAY take
      action on the message.

      <t><xref target="Figure8" /> provides an example of a Diameter message that caused an
      application error. When application errors occur, the Diameter entity
      reporting the error clears the 'R' bit in the Command Flags, and adds
      the Result-Code AVP with the proper value. Application errors do not
      require any proxy or relay agent involvement, and therefore the message
      would be forwarded back to the originator of the request.</t>
      <t>In the case where the answer message itself contains errors,
      any related session SHOULD be terminated by sending an STR or ASR
      message. The Termination-Cause AVP in the STR MAY be filled with 
      the appropriate value to indicate the cause of the error. An application 
      MAY also send an application-specific request instead of STR or ASR
      to signal the error in the case where no state is maintained or to
      allow for some form of error recovery with the corresponding Diameter 
      entity.
      </t>
      <t>There are certain Result-Code AVP application errors that require
      additional AVPs to be present in the answer. In these cases, the
      Diameter node that sets the Result-Code AVP to indicate the error MUST
      add the AVPs. Examples are:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>A request with an unrecognized AVP is received with the 'M' bit (Mandatory bit)
        set, causes an answer to be sent with the Result-Code AVP set to
        DIAMETER_AVP_UNSUPPORTED, and the Failed-AVP AVP containing the
        offending AVP.</t>
        <t>A request with an AVP that is received with an unrecognized value causes an
        answer to be returned with the Result-Code AVP set to
        DIAMETER_INVALID_AVP_VALUE, with the Failed-AVP AVP containing the
        AVP causing the error.</t>
        <t>A received command which is missing AVP(s) that are defined as
        required in the commands ABNF; examples are AVPs indicated as {AVP}.
        The receiver issues an answer with the Result-Code set to DIAMETER_MISSING_AVP, 
        and creates an AVP with the AVP Code and other fields set as expected 
        in the missing AVP. The created AVP is then added to the Failed- AVP AVP.</t>
      </list></t>
      <t>The Result-Code AVP describes the error that the Diameter node
      encountered in its processing. In case there are multiple errors, the
      Diameter node MUST report only the first error it encountered (detected
      possibly in some implementation dependent order). The specific errors
      that can be described by this AVP are described in the following

        value of the Result-Code AVP will provide information on the reason
        for the Failed-AVP AVP. A Diameter message SHOULD contain only one
        Failed-AVP that corresponds to the error indicated by the Result-Code
        AVP. For practical purposes, this Failed-AVP would typically refer to
        the first AVP processing error that a Diameter node encounters.</t>
        <t>The possible reasons for this AVP are the presence of an
        improperly constructed AVP, an unsupported or unrecognized AVP, an
        invalid AVP value, the omission of a required AVP, the presence of an
        explicitly excluded AVP (see tables in Section 10), or the presence
        of two or more occurrences of an AVP which is restricted to 0, 1, or
        0-1 occurrences.</t>
        <t>A Diameter message SHOULD contain one Failed-AVP AVP, containing the

        code, the missing vendor id, and a zero filled payload of the minimum
        required length for the omitted AVP will be added. If the failure
        reason is an invalid AVP length where the reported length is less
        than the minimum AVP header length or greater than the reported

    <section anchor="DUS" title="Diameter User Sessions">
      <t>In general, Diameter can provide two different types of services to
      applications. The first involves authentication and authorization, and
      can optionally make use of accounting. The second only makes use of
      accounting.</t>
      <t>When a service makes use of the authentication and/or
      authorization portion of an application, and a user requests access to
      the network, the Diameter client issues an auth request to its local
      server. The auth request is defined in a service-specific Diameter
      application (e.g., NASREQ). The request contains a Session-Id AVP,
      which is used in subsequent messages (e.g., subsequent authorization,
      accounting, etc) relating to the user's session. The Session-Id AVP is
      a means for the client and servers to correlate a Diameter message with
      a user session.</t>
      <t>When a Diameter server authorizes a user to use network resources
      for a finite amount of time, and it is willing to extend the
      authorization via a future request, it MUST add the Authorization-
      Lifetime AVP to the answer message. The Authorization-Lifetime AVP
      defines the maximum number of seconds a user MAY make use of the
      resources before another authorization request is expected by the
      server. The Auth-Grace-Period AVP contains the number of seconds
      following the expiration of the Authorization-Lifetime, after which the
      server will release all state information related to the user's
      session. Note that if payment for services is expected by the serving
      realm from the user's home realm, the Authorization-Lifetime AVP,
      combined with the Auth-Grace-Period AVP, implies the maximum length of
      the session the home realm is willing to be fiscally responsible for.
      Services provided past the expiration of the Authorization-Lifetime and
      Auth-Grace-Period AVPs are the responsibility of the access device. Of
      course, the actual cost of services rendered is clearly outside the
      scope of the protocol.</t>
      <t>An access device that does not expect to send a re-authorization or
      a session termination request to the server MAY include the Auth-
      Session-State AVP with the value set to NO_STATE_MAINTAINED as a hint
      to the server. If the server accepts the hint, it agrees that since no
      session termination message will be received once service to the user
      is terminated, it cannot maintain state for the session. If the answer
      message from the server contains a different value in the
      Auth-Session-State AVP (or the default value if the AVP is absent), the
      access device MUST follow the server's directives. Note that the value
      NO_STATE_MAINTAINED MUST NOT be set in subsequent re-authorization
      requests and answers.</t>
      <t>The base protocol does not include any authorization request
      messages, since these are largely application-specific and are defined
      in a Diameter application document. However, the base protocol does
      define a set of messages that are used to terminate user sessions. These
      are used to allow servers that maintain state information to free
      resources.</t>
      <t>When a service only makes use of the Accounting portion of the
      Diameter protocol, even in combination with an application, the
      Session-Id is still used to identify user sessions. However, the
      session termination messages are not used, since a session is signaled
      as being terminated by issuing an accounting stop message.</t>
      <t>Diameter may also be used for services that cannot be easily
      categorized as authentication, authorization or accounting (e.g.,
      certain 3GPP IMS interfaces). In such cases, the finite state machine
      defined in subsequent sections may not be applicable. Therefore, the
      applications itself MAY need to define its own finite state machine.
      However, such application-specific state machines SHOULD follow the
      general state machine framework outlined in this document such as the
      use of Session-Id AVPs and the use of STR/STA, ASR/ASA messages for
      stateful sessions.</t>
      <section anchor="authses" title="Authorization Session State Machine">
        <t>This section contains a set of finite state machines, representing
        the life cycle of Diameter sessions, and which MUST be observed by
        all Diameter implementations that make use of the authentication
        and/or authorization portion of a Diameter application. The term
        Service-Specific below refers to a message defined in a Diameter
        application (e.g., Mobile IPv4, NASREQ).</t>
        <t>There are four different authorization session state machines
        supported in the Diameter base protocol. The first two describe a
        session in which the server is maintaining session state, indicated
        by the value of the Auth-Session-State AVP (or its absence). One
        describes the session from a client perspective, the other from a
        server perspective. The second two state machines are used when the
        server does not maintain session state. Here again, one describes the
        session from a client perspective, the other from a server
        perspective.</t>
        <t>When a session is moved to the Idle state, any resources that were
        allocated for the particular session must be released. Any event not
        listed in the state machines MUST be considered as an error
        condition, and an answer, if applicable, MUST be returned to the
        originator of the message.</t>
        <t>In the case that an application does not support re-auth, the state
        transitions related to server-initiated re-auth when both client and
        server session maintains state (e.g., Send RAR, Pending, Receive RAA)
        MAY be ignored.</t>
        <t>In the state table, the event 'Failure to send X' means that the
        Diameter agent is unable to send command X to the desired
        destination. This could be due to the peer being down, or due to the
        peer sending back a transient failure or temporary protocol error
        notification DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY or DIAMETER_LOOP_DETECTED in the
        Result-Code AVP of the corresponding Answer command. The event 'X
        successfully sent' is the complement of 'Failure to send X'.</t>
        <t>The following state machine is observed by a client when state is
        maintained on the server:

      <section anchor="accses" title="Accounting Session State Machine">
        <t>The following state machines MUST be supported for applications
        that have an accounting portion or that require only accounting
        services. The first state machine is to be observed by clients.</t>
        <t>See Section 9.7 for Accounting Command Codes and Section 9.8 for
        Accounting AVPs.</t>
        <t>The server side in the accounting state machine depends in some
        cases on the particular application. The Diameter base protocol
        defines a default state machine that MUST be followed by all
        applications that have not specified other state machines. This is
        the second state machine in this section described below.</t>
        <t>The default server side state machine requires the reception of
        accounting records in any order and at any time, and does not place
        any standards requirement on the processing of these records.
        Implementations of Diameter may perform checking, ordering,
        correlation, fraud detection, and other tasks based on these records.
        AVPs may need to be inspected as a part of these tasks. The tasks can happen either
        immediately after record reception or in a post-processing phase.
        However, as these tasks are typically application or even policy
        dependent, they are not standardized by the Diameter specifications.
        Applications MAY define requirements on when to accept accounting
        records based on the used value of Accounting-Realtime-Required AVP,
        credit limits checks, and so on.</t>
        <t>However, the Diameter base protocol defines one optional server
        side state machine that MAY be followed by applications that require
        keeping track of the session state at the accounting server. Note
        that such tracking is incompatible with the ability to sustain long
        duration connectivity problems. Therefore, the use of this state
        machine is recommended only in applications where the value of the
        Accounting-Realtime-Required AVP is DELIVER_AND_GRANT, and hence
        accounting connectivity problems are required to cause the serviced
        user to be disconnected. Otherwise, records produced by the client
        may be lost by the server which no longer accepts them after the
        connectivity is re-established. This state machine is the third state
        machine in this section. The state machine is supervised by a
        supervision session timer Ts, which the value should be reasonably
        higher than the Acct_Interim_Interval value. Ts MAY be set to two
        times the value of the Acct_Interim_Interval so as to avoid the
        accounting session in the Diameter server to change to Idle state in
        case of short transient network failure.</t>
        <t>Any event not listed in the state machines MUST be considered as
        an error condition, and a corresponding answer, if applicable, MUST
        be returned to the originator of the message.</t>
        <t>In the state table, the event 'Failure to send' means that the
        Diameter client is unable to communicate with the desired
        destination. This could be due to the peer being down, or due to the
        peer sending back a transient failure or temporary protocol error
        notification DIAMETER_OUT_OF_SPACE, DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY, or
        DIAMETER_LOOP_DETECTED in the Result-Code AVP of the Accounting
        Answer command.</t>
        <t>The event 'Failed answer' means that the Diameter client received
        a non-transient failure notification in the Accounting Answer
        command.</t>
        <t>Note that the action 'Disconnect user/dev' MUST have an effect
        also to the authorization session state table, e.g., cause the STR
        message to be sent, if the given application has both
        authentication/authorization and accounting portions.</t>
        <t>The states PendingS, PendingI, PendingL, PendingE and PendingB
        stand for pending states to wait for an answer to an accounting
        request related to a Start, Interim, Stop, Event or buffered record,
        respectively.

      <section anchor="sester" title="Session Termination">
        <t>It is necessary for a Diameter server that authorized a session,
        for which it is maintaining state, to be notified when that session
        is no longer active, both for tracking purposes as well as to allow
        stateful agents to release any resources that they may have provided
        for the user's session. For sessions whose state is not being
        maintained, this section is not used.</t>
        <t>When a user session that required Diameter authorization
        terminates, the access device that provided the service MUST issue a
        Session- Termination-Request (STR) message to the Diameter server
        that authorized the service, to notify it that the session is no
        longer active. An STR MUST be issued when a user session terminates
        for any reason, including user logoff, expiration of Session-Timeout,
        administrative action, termination upon receipt of an Abort-Session-
        Request (see below), orderly shutdown of the access device, etc.</t>
        <t>The access device also MUST issue an STR for a session that was
        authorized but never actually started. This could occur, for example,
        due to a sudden resource shortage in the access device, or because
        the access device is unwilling to provide the type of service
        requested in the authorization, or because the access device does not
        support a mandatory AVP returned in the authorization, etc.</t>
        <t>It is also possible that a session that was authorized is never
        actually started due to action of a proxy. For example, a proxy may
        modify an authorization answer, converting the result from success to
        failure, prior to forwarding the message to the access device. If the
        answer did not contain an Auth-Session-State AVP with the value
        NO_STATE_MAINTAINED, a proxy that causes an authorized session not to
        be started MUST issue an STR to the Diameter server that authorized
        the session, since the access device has no way of knowing that the
        session had been authorized.</t>
        <t>A Diameter server that receives an STR message MUST clean up
        resources (e.g., session state) associated with the Session-Id
        specified in the STR, and return a Session-Termination-Answer.</t>
        <t>A Diameter server also MUST clean up resources when the Session-
        Timeout expires, or when the Authorization-Lifetime and the Auth-
        Grace-Period AVPs expires without receipt of a re-authorization
        request, regardless of whether an STR for that session is received.
        The access device is not expected to provide service beyond the
        expiration of these timers; thus, expiration of either of these
        timers implies that the access device may have unexpectedly shut
        down.</t>

        <t>The Origin-State-Id is used to allow detection of terminated
        sessions for which no STR would have been issued, due to
        unanticipated shutdown of an access device.</t>
        <t>A Diameter client or access device increments the value of the Origin-State-Id
        every time it is started or powered-up. The new Origin-State-Id is
        then sent in the CER/CEA message immediately upon connection to the server.
        The Diameter server receiving the new Origin-State-Id can determine
        whether the sending Diameter client had abruptly shutdown by comparing
        the old value of the Origin-State-Id it has kept for that specific
        client is less than the new value and whether it has un-terminated
        sessions originating from that client.</t>
        <t>An access device can also include the Origin-State-Id in request

      <section anchor="sesavp" title="Session-Id AVP">
        <t>The Session-Id AVP (AVP Code 263) is of type UTF8String and is
        used to identify a specific session (see Section 8). All messages
        pertaining to a specific session MUST include only one Session-Id AVP
        and the same value MUST be used throughout the life of a session.
        When present, the Session-Id SHOULD appear immediately following the
        Diameter Header (see Section 3).</t>
        <t>The Session-Id MUST be globally and eternally unique, as it is
        meant to uniquely identify a user session without reference to any
        other information, and may be needed to correlate historical
        authentication information with accounting information. The
        Session-Id includes a mandatory portion and an implementation-defined
        portion; a recommended format for the implementation-defined portion
        is outlined below.</t>
        <t>The Session-Id MUST begin with the sender's identity encoded in
        the DiameterIdentity type (see Section 4.4). The remainder of the
        Session-Id is delimited by a ";" character, and MAY be any sequence
        that the client can guarantee to be eternally unique; however, the
        following format is recommended, (square brackets [] indicate an
        optional element):
        <artwork>
   &lt;DiameterIdentity&gt;;&lt;high 32 bits&gt;;&lt;low 32 bits&gt;[;&lt;optional value&gt;]
        </artwork></t>
        <t>&lt;high 32 bits&gt; and &lt;low 32 bits&gt; are decimal
        representations of the high and low 32 bits of a monotonically
        increasing 64-bit value. The 64-bit value is rendered in two part to
        simplify formatting by 32-bit processors. At startup, the high 32
        bits of the 64-bit value MAY be initialized to the time in NTP format
        <xref target="RFC5905" />, and the low 32 bits MAY be initialized to zero.
        This will for practical purposes eliminate the possibility of overlapping
        Session-Ids after a reboot, assuming the reboot process takes longer than
        a second. Alternatively, an implementation MAY keep track of the increasing
        value in non-volatile memory.</t>
        <t>
          <artwork>
&lt;optional value&gt; is implementation specific but may include a modem's
device Id, a layer 2 address, timestamp, etc.

Example, in which there is no optional value:

   accesspoint7.example.com;1876543210;523

Example, in which there is an optional value:

  accesspoint7.example.com;1876543210;523;mobile@200.1.1.88
          </artwork>
        </t>
        <t>The Session-Id is created by the Diameter application initiating
        the session, which in most cases is done by the client. Note that a
        Session-Id MAY be used for both the authentication, authorization and accounting
        commands of a given application.</t>

      <section anchor="sdm" title="Server Directed Model">
        <t>The server directed model means that the device generating the

        data shall be forwarded. This information includes accounting record
        timeliness requirements.</t>
        <t>As discussed in
        <xref target="RFC2975" />, real-time transfer of accounting records
        is a requirement, such as the need to perform credit limit checks and
        fraud detection. Note that batch accounting is not a requirement, and
        is therefore not supported by Diameter. Should batched accounting be
        required in the future, a new Diameter application will need to be
        created, or it could be handled using another protocol. Note,
        however, that even if at the Diameter layer accounting requests are
        processed one by one, transport protocols used under Diameter
        typically batch several requests in the same packet under heavy
        traffic conditions. This may be sufficient for many applications.</t>
        <t>The authorization server (chain) directs the selection of proper
        transfer strategy, based on its knowledge of the user and
        relationships of roaming partnerships. The server (or agents) uses
        the Acct-Interim-Interval and Accounting-Realtime-Required AVPs to
        control the operation of the Diameter peer operating as a client. The
        Acct-Interim-Interval AVP, when present, instructs the Diameter node
        acting as a client to produce accounting records continuously even
        during a session. Accounting-Realtime-Required AVP is used to control
        the behavior of the client when the transfer of accounting records
        from the Diameter client is delayed or unsuccessful.</t>
        <t>The Diameter accounting server MAY override the interim interval
        or the realtime requirements by including the Acct-Interim-Interval
        or Accounting-Realtime-Required AVP in the Accounting-Answer message.
        When one of these AVPs is present, the latest value received SHOULD
        be used in further accounting activities for the same session.</t>

      <section anchor="prm" title="Protocol Messages">
        <t>A Diameter node that receives a successful authentication and/or
        authorization messages from the Diameter server SHOULD collect
        accounting information for the session. The Accounting-Request
        message is used to transmit the accounting information to the
        Diameter server, which MUST reply with the Accounting-Answer message to
        confirm reception. The Accounting-Answer message includes the
        Result-Code AVP, which MAY indicate that an error was present in the
        accounting message. The value of the Accounting-Realtime-Required AVP
        received earlier for the session in question may indicate that the
        user's session has to be terminated when a rejected Accounting-Request
        message was received.</t>

      <section anchor="appdoc" title="Accounting Application Extension and Requirements">
        <t>Each Diameter application (e.g., NASREQ, MobileIP), SHOULD define
        their Service-Specific AVPs that MUST be present in the
        Accounting-Request message in a section entitled "Accounting AVPs".
        The application MUST assume that the AVPs described in this document
        will be present in all Accounting messages, so only their respective
        service-specific AVPs need to be defined in that section.</t>
        <t>Applications have the option of using one or both
         of the following accounting application extension models:
        </t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Split Accounting Service"><vspace blankLines="1" />
           The accounting message will carry the Application Id
           of the Diameter base accounting application (see <xref target="appl"/>).
           Accounting messages may be routed to Diameter nodes other than the corresponding
           Diameter application. These nodes might be centralized accounting servers
           that provide accounting service for multiple different Diameter applications.
           These nodes MUST advertise the Diameter base accounting Application Id
           during capabilities exchange. <vspace blankLines="1" />
          </t>
          <t hangText="Coupled Accounting Service"><vspace blankLines="1" />
           The accounting messages will carry the Application Id
           of the application that is using it. The application itself
           will process the received accounting records or forward them to
           an accounting server. There is no accounting application
           advertisement required during capabilities exchange and the
           accounting messages will be routed the same as any of the other
           application messages.
          </t>
          <t>In cases where an application does not define its own accounting
           service, it is preferred that the split accounting model be used.</t>

      <section anchor="falre" title="Fault Resilience">
        <t>Diameter Base protocol mechanisms are used to overcome small
        message loss and network faults of temporary nature.</t>
        <t>Diameter peers acting as clients MUST implement the use of
        failover to guard against server failures and certain network
        failures. Diameter peers acting as agents or related off-line
        processing systems MUST detect duplicate accounting records caused by
        the sending of same record to several servers and duplication of
        messages in transit. This detection MUST be based on the inspection
        of the Session-Id and Accounting-Record-Number AVP pairs. <xref target="appDD" />
        discusses duplicate detection needs and implementation issues.</t>
        <t>Diameter clients MAY have non-volatile memory for the safe storage
        of accounting records over reboots or extended network failures,
        network partitions, and server failures. If such memory is available,
        the client SHOULD store new accounting records there as soon as the
        records are created and until a positive acknowledgement of their
        reception from the Diameter Server has been received. Upon a reboot,
        the client MUST starting sending the records in the non-volatile
        memory to the accounting server with appropriate modifications in
        termination cause, session length, and other relevant information in
        the records.</t>
        <t>A further application of this protocol may include AVPs to control
        how many accounting records may at most be stored in the Diameter
        client without committing them to the non-volatile memory or
        transferring them to the Diameter server.</t>
        <t>The client SHOULD NOT remove the accounting data from any of its
        memory areas before the correct Accounting-Answer has been received.
        The client MAY remove oldest, undelivered or yet unacknowledged
        accounting data if it runs out of resources such as memory. It is an
        implementation dependent matter for the client to accept new sessions
        under this condition.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="acccrec" title="Accounting Records">
        <t>In all accounting records, the Session-Id AVP MUST be present; the
        User-Name AVP MUST be present if it is available to the Diameter
        client.</t>
        <t>Different types of accounting records are sent depending on the
        actual type of accounted service and the authorization server's
        directions for interim accounting. If the accounted service is a
        one-time event, meaning that the start and stop of the event are
        simultaneous, then the Accounting-Record-Type AVP MUST be present and
        set to the value EVENT_RECORD.</t>
        <t>If the accounted service is of a measurable length, then the AVP
        MUST use the values START_RECORD, STOP_RECORD, and possibly,
        INTERIM_RECORD. If the authorization server has not directed interim
        accounting to be enabled for the session, two accounting records MUST
        be generated for each service of type session. When the initial
        Accounting-Request for a given session is sent, the Accounting-
        Record-Type AVP MUST be set to the value START_RECORD. When the last
        Accounting-Request is sent, the value MUST be STOP_RECORD.</t>
        <t>If the authorization server has directed interim accounting to be
        enabled, the Diameter client MUST produce additional records between
        the START_RECORD and STOP_RECORD, marked INTERIM_RECORD. The
        production of these records is directed by Acct-Interim-Interval as
        well as any re-authentication or re-authorization of the session. The
        Diameter client MUST overwrite any previous interim accounting
        records that are locally stored for delivery, if a new record is
        being generated for the same session. This ensures that only one
        pending interim record can exist on an access device for any given
        session.</t>
        <t>A particular value of Accounting-Sub-Session-Id MUST appear only
        in one sequence of accounting records from a DIAMETER client, except
        for the purposes of retransmission. The one sequence that is sent
        MUST be either one record with Accounting-Record-Type AVP set to the
        value EVENT_RECORD, or several records starting with one having the
        value START_RECORD, followed by zero or more INTERIM_RECORD and a
        single STOP_RECORD. A particular Diameter application specification
        MUST define the type of sequences that MUST be used.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="coacccrec" title="Correlation of Accounting Records">
        <t>If an application uses accounting messages, it can correlate accounting
         records with a specific application session by using the Session-Id of the
         particular application session in the accounting messages. Accounting
         messages MAY also use a different Session-Id from that of the application
         sessions in which case other session related information is needed to
         perform correlation.</t>
        <t>In cases where an application requires multiple accounting sub-session,
         an Accounting-Sub-Session-Id AVP is used to differentiate each sub-session.
         The Session-Id would remain constant for all sub-sessions and is be used
         to correlate all the sub-sessions to a particular application session.
         Note that receiving a STOP_RECORD with no Accounting-Sub-Session-Id AVP
         when sub-sessions were originally used in the START_RECORD messages
         implies that all sub-sessions are terminated.</t>
        <t>There are also cases where an application needs to correlate multiple
         application sessions into a single accounting record; the accounting record
         may span multiple different Diameter applications and sessions used by
         the same user at a given time. In such cases, the Acct-Multi-Session-Id
         AVP is used. The Acct-Multi-Session-Id AVP SHOULD be signaled by the
         server to the access device (typically during authorization) when it
         determines that a request belongs to an existing session. The access device
         MUST then include the Acct-Multi-Session-Id AVP in all subsequent 
         accounting messages.</t>
        <t>The Acct-Multi-Session-Id AVP MAY include the value of the
        original Session-Id. It's contents are implementation specific, but
        MUST be globally unique across other Acct-Multi-Session-Id, and MUST
        NOT change during the life of a session.</t>
        <t>A Diameter application document MUST define the exact concept of a
        session that is being accounted, and MAY define the concept of a
        multi-session. For instance, the NASREQ DIAMETER application treats a
        single PPP connection to a Network Access Server as one session, and
        a set of Multilink PPP sessions as one multi-session.</t>

          two+N accounting records, based on the needs of the

            <t>The inclusion of the AVP with Value field set to a non-zero

      <t>This section contains the configurable parameters that are found
      throughout this document:
      <list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="Diameter Peer">
        <vspace blankLines="1" />A Diameter entity MAY communicate with
        peers that are statically configured. A statically configured
        Diameter peer would require that either the IP address or the fully
        qualified domain name (FQDN) be supplied, which would then be used to
        resolve through DNS.</t>
        <t hangText="Routing Table">
        <vspace blankLines="1" />A Diameter proxy server routes
        messages based on the realm portion of a Network Access Identifier
        (NAI). The server MUST have a table of Realm Names, and the address
        of the peer to which the message must be forwarded to. The routing
        table MAY also include a "default route", which is typically used for
        all messages that cannot be locally processed.</t>
        <t hangText="Tc timer">
        <vspace blankLines="1" />The Tc timer controls the frequency that
        transport connection attempts are done to a peer with whom no active
        transport connection exists. The recommended value is 30 seconds.</t>
      </list></t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="seccons" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The Diameter base protocol messages SHOULD be secured by using TLS
      <xref target="RFC5246" /> or DTLS/SCTP <xref target="RFC6083" />. 
      Additional security mechanisms such as IPsec 
      <xref target="RFC4301"/> MAY also be deployed to secure connections between
      peers. However, all Diameter base protocol implementations MUST support 
      the use of TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP and the Diameter protocol MUST NOT be used without any
      security mechanism.</t>
      <t>If a Diameter connection is to be protected via TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP or IPsec, then
      TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP or IPsec/IKE SHOULD begin prior to any Diameter message exchange.
      All security parameters for TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP or IPsec are configured independent of
      the Diameter protocol. All Diameter message will be sent through the
      TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP or IPsec connection after a successful setup.</t>
      <t>For TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP connections to be established in the open state, the CER/CEA	
      exchange MUST include an Inband-Security-ID AVP with a value of TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP.	
      The TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP handshake will begin when both ends successfully reached the
      open state, after completion of the CER/CEA exchange. If the TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP	
      handshake is successful, all further messages will be sent via TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP.	
      If the handshake fails, both ends move to the closed state. See	
      Sections 13.1 for more details.</t>
      <section anchor="TLSus" title="TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP Usage">
        <t>Diameter nodes using TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP for security MUST mutually authenticate 
        as part of TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP session establishment. In order to ensure mutual
        authentication, the Diameter node acting as TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP server MUST request 
        a certificate from the Diameter node acting as TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP client, and the
        Diameter node acting as TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP client MUST be prepared to supply a
        certificate on request.</t>
        <t>Diameter nodes MUST be able to negotiate the following TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP cipher
        suites:
        <artwork>
      TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5
      TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA
      TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
        </artwork></t>
        <t>Diameter nodes SHOULD be able to negotiate the following TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP
        cipher suite:
        <artwork>
      TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
        </artwork></t>
        <t>Diameter nodes MAY negotiate other TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP cipher suites.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="ptpcos" title="Peer-to-Peer Considerations">
        <t>As with any peer-to-peer protocol, proper configuration of the
        trust model within a Diameter peer is essential to security. When
        certificates are used, it is necessary to configure the root
        certificate authorities trusted by the Diameter peer. These root CAs
        are likely to be unique to Diameter usage and distinct from the root
        CAs that might be trusted for other purposes such as Web browsing. In
        general, it is expected that those root CAs will be configured so as
        to reflect the business relationships between the organization
        hosting the Diameter peer and other organizations. As a result, a
        Diameter peer will typically not be configured to allow connectivity
        with any arbitrary peer. With certificate authentication, Diameter
        peers may not be known beforehand and therefore peer discovery may
        be required.</t>

    <section anchor="appNAPTR" title="S-NAPTR Example">
      <t>As an example, consider a client that wishes to resolve
      aaa:example1.com. The client performs a NAPTR query for that domain, and
      the following NAPTR records are returned:
      <artwork>
 ;;        order pref flags service   regexp replacement
 IN NAPTR  50    50   "s"   "aaa:diameter.tls.tcp" ""     
              _diameter._tls.example1.com 
 IN NAPTR  100   50   "s"   "aaa:diameter.tcp" 	   ""     
              _aaa._tcp.example1.com 
 IN NAPTR  150   50   "s"   "aaa:diameter.sctp"    ""     
              _diameter._sctp.example1.com
    </artwork></t>
      <t>This indicates that the server supports TLS, TCP and SCTP in that
      order. If the client supports TLS, TLS will be used, targeted
      to a host determined by an SRV lookup of _diameter._tls.example1.com.
      That lookup would return:
      <artwork>
 ;;       Priority  Weight  Port    Target
 IN SRV   0         1       5060    server1.example1.com
 IN SRV   0         2       5060    server2.example1.com
      </artwork></t>
      <t>As an alternative example, a client that wishes to resolve
      aaa:example2.com. The client performs a NAPTR query for that domain, and
      the following NAPTR records are returned:
      <artwork>
 ;;        order pref flags service   regexp replacement
 IN NAPTR  150   50   "a"   "aaa:diameter.tls.tcp"  ""     
              server1.example2.com
 IN NAPTR  150   50   "a"   "aaa:diameter.tls.tcp"  ""     
              server2.example2.com
    </artwork></t>
      <t>This indicates that the server supports TCP available at the returned host names.</t>

    <section anchor="appDD" title="Duplicate Detection">
      <t>As described in Section 9.4, accounting record duplicate detection
      is based on session identifiers. Duplicates can appear for various
      reasons:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Failover to an alternate server. Where close to real-time
        performance is required, failover thresholds need to be kept low
        and this may lead to an increased likelihood of duplicates.
        Failover can occur at the client or within Diameter agents.</t>
        <t>Failure of a client or agent after sending of a record from non-
        volatile memory, but prior to receipt of an application layer ACK
        and deletion of the record. record to be sent. This will result in
        retransmission of the record soon after the client or agent has
        rebooted.</t>
        <t>Duplicates received from RADIUS gateways. Since the
        retransmission behavior of RADIUS is not defined within [RFC2865],
        the likelihood of duplication will vary according to the
        implementation.</t>
        <t>Implementation problems and misconfiguration.</t>
      </list></t>
      <t>The T flag is used as an indication of an application layer
      retransmission event, e.g., due to failover to an alternate server.
      It is defined only for request messages sent by Diameter clients or
      agents. For instance, after a reboot, a client may not know whether
      it has already tried to send the accounting records in its non-
      volatile memory before the reboot occurred. Diameter servers MAY use
      the T flag as an aid when processing requests and detecting duplicate
      messages. However, servers that do this MUST ensure that duplicates
      are found even when the first transmitted request arrives at the
      server after the retransmitted request. It can be used only in cases
      where no answer has been received from the Server for a request and
      the request is sent again, (e.g., due to a failover to an alternate
      peer, due to a recovered primary peer or due to a client re-sending a
      stored record from non-volatile memory such as after reboot of a
      client or agent).</t>
      <t>In some cases the Diameter accounting server can delay the
      duplicate detection and accounting record processing until a
      post-processing phase takes place. At that time records are likely to
      be sorted according to the included User-Name and duplicate
      elimination is easy in this case. In other situations it may be
      necessary to perform real-time duplicate detection, such as when
      credit limits are imposed or real-time fraud detection is
      desired.</t>
      <t>In general, only generation of duplicates due to failover or re-
      sending of records in non-volatile storage can be reliably detected
      by Diameter clients or agents. In such cases the Diameter client or
      agents can mark the message as possible duplicate by setting the T
      flag. Since the Diameter server is responsible for duplicate
      detection, it can choose to make use of the T flag or not, in order
      to optimize duplicate detection. Since the T flag does not affect
      interoperability, and may not be needed by some servers, generation
      of the T flag is REQUIRED for Diameter clients and agents, but MAY be
      implemented by Diameter servers.</t>
      <t>As an example, it can be usually be assumed that duplicates appear
      within a time window of longest recorded network partition or device
      fault, perhaps a day. So only records within this time window need to
      be looked at in the backward direction. Secondly, hashing techniques
      or other schemes, such as the use of the T flag in the received
      messages, may be used to eliminate the need to do a full search even
      in this set except for rare cases.</t>
      <t>The following is an example of how the T flag may be used by the
      server to detect duplicate requests.
      <vspace blankLines="1" />
      <list>
        <t>A Diameter server MAY check the T flag of the received message
        to determine if the record is a possible duplicate. If the T flag
        is set in the request message, the server searches for a duplicate
        within a configurable duplication time window backward and forward.
        This limits database searching to those records where the T flag is
        set. In a well run network, network partitions and device faults
        will presumably be rare events, so this approach represents a
        substantial optimization of the duplicate detection process. During
        failover, it is possible for the original record to be received
        after the T flag marked record, due to differences in network
        delays experienced along the path by the original and duplicate
        transmissions. The likelihood of this occurring increases as the
        failover interval is decreased. In order to be able to detect out
        of order duplicates, the Diameter server should use backward and
        forward time windows when performing duplicate checking for the T
        flag marked request. For example, in order to allow time for the
        original record to exit the network and be recorded by the
        accounting server, the Diameter server can delay processing records
        with the T flag set until a time period TIME_WAIT +
        RECORD_PROCESSING_TIME has elapsed after the closing of the
        original transport connection. After this time period has expired,
        then it may check the T flag marked records against the database
        with relative assurance that the original records, if sent, have
        been received and recorded.</t>

    <section anchor="appIDNA" title="Internationalized Domain Names">
      <t>To be compatible with the existing DNS infrastructure and simplify
      host and domain name comparison, Diameter identities (FQDNs) are represented
      in ASCII form. This allows the Diameter protocol to fall in-line with the DNS
      strategy of being transparent from the effects of Internationalized Domain Names
      (IDNs) by following the recommendations in <xref target="RFC4690" /> and
      <xref target="RFC5890" />. Applications that provide support for IDNs outside
      of the Diameter protocol but interacting with it SHOULD use the representation
      and conversion framework described in <xref target="RFC5890" />, <xref target="RFC5891" />
      and <xref target="RFC3492" />.

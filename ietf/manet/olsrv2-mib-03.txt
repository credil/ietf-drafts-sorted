                     draft-ietf-manet-olsrv2-mib-03

Abstract

   This memo defines the Management Information Base (MIB) for
   configuring and managing the Optimized Link State Routing protocol
   version 2 (OLSRv2).  The Optimized Link State Routing MIB is
   structured into state information, performance metrics, and
   notifications.  This additional state and performance information is
   useful to troubleshoot problems and performance issues of the routing
   protocol.  Different levels of compliance allow implementers to use
   smaller subsets of all defined objects, allowing for this MIB to be
   deployed on more constrained routers.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines the Management Information Base (MIB) for
   configuring and managing the Optimized Link State Routing protocol
   version 2 (OLSRv2).  The Optimized Link State Routing MIB is
   structured into state information, performance metrics, and
   notifications.  In addition to configuration, this additional state
   and performance information is useful to troubleshoot problems and
   performance issues of the routing protocol.  Different levels of
   compliance allow implementers to use smaller subsets of all defined
   objects, allowing for this MIB to be deployed on more constrained
   routers.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in
   [RFC2578], [RFC2579], and [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) [OLSRv2]
   is a table driven, proactive routing protocol, i.e. it exchanges
   topology information with other routers in the network regularly.
   OLSRv2 is an optimization of the classical link state routing
   protocol.  Its key concept is that of MultiPoint Relays (MPRs).  Each
   router selects a set of its neighbor routers (which "cover" all of
   its symmetrically connected 2-hop neighbor routers) as MPRs.  MPRs
   are then used to achieve both flooding reduction and topology
   reduction.

   This MIB document provides management and control capabilities of an
   OLSRv2 instance, allowing to monitor the state and performance of an

   OLSRV2 router, as well as to change settings of the deployment.

   As OLSRv2 relies on the neighborhood information discovered by NHDP
   [NHDP], the OLSRv2-MIB is aligned with the NHDP-MIB [NHDP-MIB].  In
   particular, common indexes for router interfaces and discovered
   neighbors are used, as described in Section 5.2.

4.1.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values which define the
      current operating state of the OLSRv2 protocol process in the
      router.

   o  Performance Objects - automatically generated values which help an
      administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the
      OLSRv2 routing process on the router.

   o  Notification Objects - define triggers and associated notification
      messages allowing for asynchronous tracking of pre-defined events
      on the managed router.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the OLSRv2-MIB module.  The
   objects are arranged into the following structure:

   o  olsrv2Objects - defines objects forming the basis for the OLSRv2-
      MIB.  These objects are divided up by function into the following
      groups:

      *  Configuration Group - defining objects related to the
         configuration of the OLSRv2 instance on the router.

      *  State Group - defining objects which reflect the current state
         of the OLSRv2 instance running on the router.

      *  Performance Group -defining objects which are useful to a
         management station when characterizing the performance of
         OLSRv2 on the router and in the MANET.

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                 January 2011


   o  olsrv2Notifications - objects defining OLSRv2-MIB notifications.

   o  olsrv2Conformance - defining the minimal and maximal conformance
      requirements for implementations of this MIB.

5.1.  The Configuration Group

   The OLSRv2 router is configured with a set of controls.  The
   authoritative list of configuration controls within the OLSRv2-MIB
   are found within the MIB module itself.  Generally, an attempt was
   made in developing the OLSRv2-MIB module to support all configuration
   objects defined in [OLSRv2].  For all of the configuration
   parameters, the same constraints and default values of these
   parameters as defined in [OLSRv2] are followed.

5.2.  The State Group

   The State Group reports current state information of a router running
   [OLSRv2].  The OLSRv2-MIB State Group tables were designed to contain
   the complete set of state information defined within the information
   bases in [OLSRv2].

   The OLSRv2-MIB State Group tables are constructed as extensions to
   the corresponding tables within the State Group of the NHDP-MIB
   [NHDP-MIB].  Further, the State Group tables defined in this MIB are
   aligned with the according tables in the NHDP-MIB [NHDP-MIB], as
   described in Section 6.2.

5.3.  The Performance Group

   The Performance Group reports values relevant to system performance.
   This section lists objects for OLSRv2 performance monitoring, some of
   which explicitly appear in the OLSRv2-MIB and others which are
   obtainable through a combination of base objects from this MIB and
   reports available through the REPORT-MIB [REPORT].  Throughout this
   section, those objects will be pointed out that are intended as base
   objects, which are explicitly defined within the OLSRv2-MIB and those
   objects which are derived through a combination of the base objects
   within the OLSRv2-MIB and capabilities afforded by the REPORT-MIB.

   The objects in this group can be used to examine stability of the
   Routing Set, the selected MPRs, as well as message scheduling of this
   router.

5.3.1.  Recalculation Performance Objects

   The following objects return statistics to the frequency of Routing
   Set recalculations.

   o  Number of Routing Set recalculations

         This object counts each recalculation of the Routing Set.

         This is a Base Object.

         Object name: olsrv2RoutingSetRecalculationCount

         Object type: Counter32

   o  Acquire history of Routing Set recalculations

         This object returns the history of the exact timestamps of each
         time the Routing Set has been recalculated.

         This is a Derived Object to be pulled from the REPORT-MIB.  It
         is derived from, e.g., the olsrv2RoutingSetRecalculationCount
         Base Object from the OLSRv2-MIB along with the capabilities
         derived from the reportHistoryGroup from the REPORT-MIB.

   o  Histogram of the intervals between Routing Set recalculations

         Returns the values that represent a histogram of intervals
         between Routing Set recalculations.

         This is a Derived Object to be pulled from the REPORT-MIB.  It
         can be derived from, e.g., the
         olsrv2RoutingSetRecalculationCount Base Object from the OLSRv2-
         MIB along with the capabilities derived from the
         reportHistoryGroup from the REPORT-MIB.  The network management
         application could convert this information into the desired
         histogram.

   o  Changes of the frequency of the Routing Set recalculations

         This object will divide the given time interval from t0 to t1
         into a given number of equal parts.  It then creates a
         histogram for each part and calculate the distances (using the
         Bhattacharyya distance) between each two adjacent histograms in
         time.  A higher value between two histograms means more
         difference between the histograms.

         This is a Derived Object to be pulled from the REPORT-MIB, as
         previously discussed, albeit this is a bit more complex with
         respect to the management application.

   The following objects return statistics to the frequency of
   recalculating the MPRs of this router.

   o  Number of MPR recalculations

         This object counts each recalculation of the MPRs of the
         router.

         This is a Base Object.

         Object name: olsrv2MPRSetRecalculationCount

         Object type: Counter32

   o  Acquire history of MPR recalculations

         This object returns the history of the exact timestamps of each
         time the MPRs have been recalculated.

         This is a Derived Object to be pulled from the REPORT-MIB.  It
         is derived from, e.g., the olsrv2MPRSetRecalculationCount Base
         Object from the OLSRv2-MIB along with the capabilities derived
         from the reportHistoryGroup from the REPORT-MIB.

   o  Histogram of the intervals between MPR recalculations

         Returns the values that represent a histogram of intervals
         between MPR recalculations.  The histogram includes all changes
         that have been made after the given time t0 and before the
         given time t1.

         This is a Derived Object to be pulled from the REPORT-MIB.  It
         can be derived from, e.g., the olsrv2MPRSetRecalculationCount
         Base Object from the OLSRv2-MIB along with the capabilities
         derived from the reportHistoryGroup from the REPORT-MIB.  The
         network management application could convert this information
         into the desired histogram.

   o  Changes of the frequency of MPR recalculations

         This object will divide the given time interval from t0 to t1
         into a given number of equal parts.  It then creates a
         histogram for each part and calculate the distances (using the
         Bhattacharyya distance) between each two adjacent histograms in
         time.  A higher value between two histograms means more
         difference between the histograms.

         This is a Derived Object to be pulled from the REPORT-MIB, as
         previously discussed, albeit this is a bit more complex with
         respect to the management application.

5.3.2.  Message-related Performance Objects

   The following objects return some of the statistics related to TC
   messages:

   o  Total number of sent TC messages on an interface

         This is a Base Object.

         Object name: olsrv2IfTcMessageXmits

         Object type: Counter32

         Object type: Counter32

   o  Total number of sent periodic TC messages on an interface

         This is a Base Object.

         Object name: olsrv2IfTcMessagePeriodicXmits

         Object type: Counter32

   o  Total number of sent triggered TC messages on an interface

         This is a Base Object.

         Object name: olsrv2IfTcMessageTriggeredXmits

         Object type: Counter32

         This is a Base Object.

         Object name: olsrv2IfTcMessageForwardedXmits

         Object type: Counter32

   o  Acquire history of TC message scheduling instance for the given
      time duration on an interface

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                 January 2011


         This object returns the history of the exact timestamps of each
         TC message that has been sent as well as the type of the
         message (triggered or periodical).  The list of events starts
         at the given point of time t0 and ends at the given time t1.

         This is a Derived Object to be pulled from the REPORT-MIB.  It
         is derived from, e.g., the olsrv2IfTcMessagePeriodicXmits and
         olsrv2IfTcMessageTriggeredXmits Base Objects from the OLSRv2-
         MIB along with the capabilities derived from the
         reportHistoryGroup from the REPORT-MIB.

   o  Histogram of the intervals between TC messages on an interface

         Returns the values (in a 2-dimensional array) that represent a
         histogram of intervals between TC messages, separated by
         periodic and triggered TC.  The histogram displays the
         distribution of intervals between two consecutive TC of the
         same type (triggered or periodical) using a given bin size.  It
         includes all TC that have been sent after the given time t0 and
         before the given time t1.

         This is a Derived Object to be pulled from the REPORT-MIB.  It
         can be derived from, e.g., the olsrv2IfTcMessagePeriodicXmits
         and olsrv2IfTcMessageTriggeredXmits Base Objects from the
         OLSRv2-MIB along with the capabilities derived from the
         reportHistoryGroup from the REPORT-MIB.  The network management
         application could convert this information into the desired
         histogram.

   o  Changes of the frequency of the message scheduling on an interface

         This object will divide the given time interval from t0 to t1
         into a given number of equal parts.  It then creates a
         histogram for each part and calculate the distances (using the
         Bhattacharyya distance) between each two adjacent histograms in
         time.  A higher value between two histograms means more
         difference between the histograms.  For instance, that could
         happen if suddenly many triggered TC messages are sent, whereas
         before there have been only very few such triggered messages.

         This is a Derived Object to be pulled from the REPORT-MIB, as
         previously discussed, albeit this is a bit more complex with
         respect to the management application.

   o  Average number of sent TC messages per second between the given
      time t0 and t1 on an interface

         This is a Derived Object to be pulled from the
         reportSampledGroup from the REPORT-MIB.  It is derived from,
         e.g., the olsrv2IfTcMessageXmits Base Object.

   o  Average number of received TC messages per second between the
      given time t0 and t1 on an interface

         This is a Derived Object to be pulled from the REPORT-MIB.  See
         the previous discussion.

   o  Total accumulated size in octets of sent TC messages on an
      interface

      the given time t0 and t1 on an interface

         This is a Derived Object to be pulled from the REPORT-MIB.  See
         the previous discussion.

   o  Total accumulated number of advertised MPR selectors in TC
      messages on an interface

         This is a Base Object.

5.4.  The Notifications Group

   The Notifications Subtree contains the list of notifications
   supported within the OLSRv2-MIB and their intended purpose or
   utility.

   The same mechanisms for improving the network performance by reducing
   the number of notifications apply as defined in Section 5.4 of
   [NHDP-MIB].  The Notifications Group contains Control, Objects and
   States, where the Control contains definitions of objects to control
   the frequency of notifications being sent.  The Objects define the
   supported notifications and the State is used to define additional
   information to be carried within the notifications.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   This section specifies the relationship of the MIB modules contained
   in this document to other standards, particularly to standards
   containing other MIB modules.  Definitions imported from other MIB
   modules and other MIB modules that SHOULD be implemented in
   conjunction with the MIB module contained within this document are
   identified in this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The OLSRv2-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to the NHDP-MIB

   OLSRv2 depends on the neighborhood information that is discovered by
   [NHDP].  In order access the Objects relating to discovered
   neighbors, the State Group tables of the NHDP-MIB [NHDP-MIB] are
   aligned with this MIB.  This is accomplished through the definition
   of two TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS in the NHDP-MIB: the NeighborInterfaceId
   and the NeighborRouterId.  These object types are used to develop
   indexes into common NHDP-MIB and routing protocol State Group tables.
   These objects are locally significant but should be locally common to
   the NHDP-MIB and the OLSRv2-MIB implemented on a common networked
   router.  This will allow for improved cross referencing of

   information across the two MIBs.

6.3.  Relationship to the REPORT-MIB

   This document describes several Performance Management metrics for
   the management of OLSRv2 routers.  However, not all of these metrics
   are explicitly defined solely within the context of this OLSRv2-MIB.
   Some of these metrics are obtained through joint interaction between
   this MIB and the REPORT-MIB [REPORT].  This OLSRv2-MIB defines the
   minimum necessary objects (often of type COUNTER) which form the
   underlying basis for more sophisticated Performance Management
   reporting available in conjunction with the REPORT-MIB.  See
   Section 5.3 for a description of the performance metrics for OLSRv2.

6.4.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The following OLSRv2-MIB module IMPORTS objects from NHDP-MIB
   [NHDP-MIB], SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF
   [RFC2580], IF-MIB [RFC2863], INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001], and SMIng
   [RFC3781].

8.  Security Considerations

   This MIB defines objects for the configuration, monitoring and
   notification of the Optimized Link State Routing protocol version 2
   [OLSRv2].  OLSRv2 allows routers to acquire topological information
   of the routing domain by virtue of exchanging TC message, to
   calculate shortest paths to each destination router in the routing
   domain, to select relays for network-wide transmissions etc.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  olsrv2TcInterval, olsrv2TcMinInterval - these writable objects
      control the rate at which TC messages are sent.  If set at too
      high a rate, this could represent a form of DOS attack by
      overloading interface resources.  If set low, OLSRv2 may not
      converge fast enough to provide accurate routes to all
      destinations in the routing domain.

   o  olsrv2TcHopLimit - defines the hop limit for TC messages.  If set
      too low, messages will not be forwarded beyond the defined scope,



Herberg, et al.           Expires July 6, 2011                 [Page 64]

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                 January 2011


      and thus routers further away from the message originator will not
      be able to construct appropriate topology graphs.

   o  olsrv2OHoldTime, olsrv2THoldTime, olsrv2AHoldTime,
      olsrv2RxHoldTime, olsrv2PHoldTime, olsrv2FHoldTime - define hold
      times for tuples of different Information Bases of OLSRv2.  If set
      too low, information will expire quickly, and may this harm a
      correct operation of the routing protocol.

   o  olsrv2Willingness - defines the willingness of this router to
      become MPR.  If this is set to WILL_NEVER (0), the managed router
      will not forward any TC messages, nor accept a selection to become
      MPR by neighboring routers.  If set to WILL_ALWAYS (15), the
      router will be preferred by neighbors during MPR selection, and
      may thus attract more traffic.

   o  olsrv2TpMaxJitter, olsrv2TtMaxJitter, olsrv2FMaxJitter - define
      jitter values for TC message transmission and forwarding.  If set
      too low, control traffic may get lost if the channel is lossy.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetTable - The contains information on the
      topology of the MANET, specifically the IP address of the routers
      in the MANET (as identified by
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr and
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetToOrigIpAddr objects).  This information
      provides an adversary broad information on the members of the
      MANET, located within this single table.  This information can be
      use to expedite attacks on the other members of the MANET without
      having to go through a laborious discovery process on their own.
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr is the index into the
      table, and has a MAX-ACCESS of 'not-accessible'.  However, this
      information can be exposed using SNMP operations.

   MANET technology is often deployed to support communications of
   emergency services or military tactical applications.  In these
   applications, it is imperative to maintain the proper operation of
   the communications network and to protect sensitive information
   related to its operation.  Therefore, when implementing these
   capabilities, the full use of SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms for
   authentication and privacy is RECOMMENDED.



Herberg, et al.           Expires July 6, 2011                 [Page 65]

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                 January 2011


   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], Section 8, including
   full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

                   GRE Key Extension for Mobile IPv4
                draft-ietf-mip4-gre-key-extension-05.txt

Abstract

   The Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) specification contains a Key
   field, which MAY contain a value that is used to identify a
   particular GRE data stream.  This specification defines a new Mobile
   IP extension that is used to exchange the value to be used in the GRE
   Key field.  This extension further allows the Mobility Agents to set
   up the necessary protocol interfaces prior to receiving the mobile's
   traffic.  The new extension allows a foreign agent to request GRE
   tunneling without disturbing the Home Agent behavior specified for
   Mobile IPv4.  GRE tunneling with the Key field allows the operators
   to have home networks that consist of multiple Virtual Private
   Networks (VPNs), which may have overlapping home addresses.  When the
   tuple < Care of Address, Home Address and Home Agent Address > is the
   same across multiple subscriber sessions, GRE tunneling will provide
   a means for the Foreign Agent and Home Agent to identify data streams
   for the individual sessions based on the GRE key.  In the absence of
   this key identifier, the data streams cannot be distinguished from
   each other, a significant drawback when using IP-in-IP tunneling.

Internet-Draft            GRE Key Ext. for MIP4                 Mar 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a new extension for use by Foreign Agent (FA)
   operating Mobile IP for IPv4.  The new extension allows a foreign
   agent to request Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) [RFC2784]
   tunneling without disturbing the Home Agent (HA) behavior specified
   for Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344].  This extension contains the GRE key
   [RFC2890] required for establishing a GRE tunnel between the FA and
   the HA.

   GRE tunneling with the Key field allows the operators to have home
   networks that consist of multiple Virtual Private Networks (VPNs),
   which may have overlapping home addresses.  When the tuple < Care of
   Address, Home Address and Home Agent Address > is the same across
   multiple subscriber sessions, GRE tunneling will provide a means for
   the FA and the HA to identify data streams for the individual
   sessions based on the GRE key.  In the absence of this key
   identifier, the data streams cannot be distinguished from each other,
   a significant drawback when using IP-in-IP tunneling.


2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  Other
   terminology is used as already defined in [RFC3344].


3.  GRE-Key Extension

   The format of the GRE-Key Extension conforms to the Extension format
   specified for Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344].  This extension option is used
   by the Foreign Agent to supply GRE key and other necessary
   information to the Home Agent to establish a GRE tunnel between the
   FA and the HA.


4.  Operation and Use of the GRE-Key Extension

4.1.  Foreign Agent Requirements for GRE Tunneling Support

   The FA MUST support IP-in-IP tunneling of datagrams for Mobile IPv4
   [RFC3344].  The FA may support GRE tunneling that can be used, for
   example, to allow for overlapping private home IP addresses
   [X.S0011-D].  If the FA is capable of supporting GRE encapsulation,
   it should set the 'G' (GRE encapsulation) bit in the Flags field in
   the Agent Advertisement message sent to the Mobile Node (MN) during



Yegani, et al.         Expires September 29, 2011               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            GRE Key Ext. for MIP4                 Mar 2011


   the Mobile IP session establishment.

   If the MN does not set the 'G' bit, the FA MAY fall back to using IP-
   in-IP encapsulation for the session per [RFC3344].

   If the MN does not set the 'G' bit and does not set the 'D'
   (Decapsulation by mobile node) bit (i.e., the mobile node does not
   request GRE tunneling and is not using a co-located care-of address),
   and the local policy allows the FA to override the 'G' bit setting
   received from the MS, the FA MUST include the GRE-Key Extension as
   defined in this memo in the Registration Request that it propogates
   to the HA.  The presence of this extension is a request for GRE
   encapsulation that takes precedence over the setting of the 'G' bit
   in the Registration Request (RRQ).  The FA MUST NOT modify the 'G'
   bit in the Registration Request because it is protected by the
   Mobile-Home Authentication Extension.

   If the FA does not support GRE encapsulation, the FA MUST reset the
   'G' bit in the Agent Advertisement message.  In this case, if the MN
   sets the 'G' bit in the Registration Request message, the FA returns
   a Registration Reply (RRP) message to the MN with code 'Requested
   Encapsulation Unavailable' (72) per [RFC3344].

   If the FA allows GRE encapsulation, and either the MN requested GRE
   encapsulation or local policy dictates using GRE encapsulation for
   the session and the 'D' bit is not set (i.e., the mobile node is not
   using a co-located care-of address, the FA MUST include the GRE Key
   in the GRE Key Extension in all Mobile IP Registration Requests
   (including initial, renewal and de-registration requests) before
   forwarding the request to the HA.  The FA may include a GRE key of
   value zero in the GRE Key Extension to signal that the HA assign GRE
   keys in both directions.  The GRE key assignment in the FA and the HA
   is outside the scope of this memo.

   The GRE Key Extension SHALL follow the format defined in [RFC3344].
   This extension SHALL be added after the MN-HA and MN-FA Challenge and
   MN-AAA extensions (if any) and before the FA-HA Auth extension (if
   any).

4.2.  Home Agent Requirements for GRE Tunneling Support

   The HA MUST follow the procedures specified in RFC 3344 in processing
   this extension in Registration Request messages.  If the HA receives
   the GRE Key Extension in a Registration Request and does not
   recognize this non-skippable extension, it MUST silently discard the
   message per [RFC3344].

   The HA MUST follow the procedures specified in RFC 3344 in processing



Yegani, et al.         Expires September 29, 2011               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            GRE Key Ext. for MIP4                 Mar 2011


   this extension in Registration Request messages.  If the HA receives
   the GRE Key Extension in a Registration Request and does not
   recognize this non-skippable extension, it MUST silently discard the
   message.  The HA MUST use other alternative forms of encapsulation
   (e.g., IP-in-IP tunneling), when requested by the mobile node per
   [RFC3344].

   If the HA receives the GRE Key Extension in a Registration Request
   and recognizes the GRE Key Extension but is not configured to support
   GRE encapsulation, it MUST send an Registration Reply with code
   'Requested Encapsulation Unavailable (139)' [RFC3024] .

   If the HA receives a Registration Request with a GRE Key Extension
   but without the 'G' bit set, the HA SHOULD treat this as if 'G' bit
   is set in the Registration Request i.e., the presence of GRE Key
   Extension indicates a request for GRE encapsulation.

   If the HA receives the GRE Key Extension in a Registration Request
   and recognizes the GRE Key Extension as well as supports GRE
   encapsulation, the following procedures should apply:

   The HA SHOULD accept the RRQ and send a RRP with code 'Accepted (0)'.
   The HA MUST assign a GRE key and include the GRE Key Extension in the
   RRP before sending it to the FA.  The HA MUST include the GRE Key
   Extension in all RRPs in response to any RRQ that included GRE Key
   Extension, when a GRE key is available for the registration.

   If the HA receives the GRE Key Extension in the initial Registration
   Request and recognizes the GRE Key Extension carrying a GRE key value
   of zero, it SHOULD accept the RRQ and send a RRP with code 'Accepted
   (0)'.  The HA MUST assign GRE keys for both directions and include
   these keys in the GRE Key Extension in the RRP before sending it to
   the FA.  The HA MUST include the GRE Key Extension in the RRP in
   response to the initial RRQ that included GRE Key Extension, when a
   GRE key is available for the registration.

4.3.  Mobile Node Requirements for GRE Tunneling Support

   If the MN is capable of supporting GRE encapsulation, it SHOULD set
   the 'G' bit in the Flags field in the Registration Request per
   [RFC3344].


5.  GRE Key Extension and Tunneling Procedures

   GRE tunneling support for Mobile IP will permit asymmetric GRE keying
   i.e., the FA assigns a GRE key for use in encapsulated traffic and
   the HA can assign its own GRE key.  Once the GRE keys have been

Internet-Draft            GRE Key Ext. for MIP4                 Mar 2011


   exchanged, the FA uses the HA-assigned key in the encapsulating GRE
   header for reverse tunneling and the HA uses the FA-assigned key in
   the encapsulating GRE header.

   The format of the GRE Key Extension is as shown below.

   The GRE Key extension MAY be included in Registration Requests or
   Registration Replies [RFC3344].  The GRE Key extension is used to
   inform the recipient of the Mobile IP request of the value to be used
   in GRE's Key field.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The GRE Key extension defined in this memo is a Mobile IP extension
   as defined in [RFC3344].  IANA should assign a Type value for this
   Extension from the non-skippable range (0-127).

   The GRE Key extension introduces a new sub-type numbering space where
   the value 0 has been assigned from the range, 0 to 255.  Approval of
   new GRE Key Extension sub-type values are to be made through Expert
   Review with Specification Required.

7.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not introduce any new security
   considerations, beyond those described in [RFC3344].

   Despite its name, the GRE Key extension has little to do with
   security.  The word "Key" here is not used in the cryptographic sense
   of a shared secret that must be protected, but rather is used in the
   sense of an "index" or demultiplexing value that can be used to
   distinguish packets belonging to a given flow within a GRE tunnel.

    <abstract>
      <t> Delivery status notifications (DSNs) are critical to the correct
	operation of an email system.  However, the existing Draft Standards
	(RFC 3461, RFC 3462, RFC 3464) are presently limited to US-ASCII text
	in the machine-readable portions of the protocol.  This specification
	adds a new address type for international email addresses so an
	original recipient address with non-US-ASCII characters can be
	correctly preserved even after downgrading.  This also provides
	updated content return media types for delivery status notifications
	and message disposition notifications to support use of the new
	address type.
      </t>
      
      <t>
	This document extends RFC 3461, RFC 3462, RFC 3464, and RFC 3798.
	It replaces the experimental RFC 5337.
      </t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>When an email message is transmitted using
	the <xref target='RFC5336'>UTF8SMTP</xref> extension
	and <xref target='RFC5335'>Internationalized Email Headers</xref>,
	it is sometimes necessary to return that message or generate
	a <xref target="RFC3798">Message Disposition Notification (MDN)</xref>.
	As a message sent to multiple recipients can generate a status and
	disposition notification for each recipient, it is helpful if a client
	can correlate these notifications based on the recipient address it
	provided; thus, preservation of the original recipient is important.
	This specification describes how to preserve the original recipient
	and updates the MDN and DSN formats to support the new address types.
      </t>
      <t>
	NOTE: The only issue for which there is (as yet) no consensus yet is
	whether to change the name of the Address Type from "UTF-8" to
	something different, such as "UTF8", to reflect the fact that
	the "&lt;addr &lt;addr&gt;&gt;" address syntax is no longer permitted. 
      </t>
      <t>
	NOTE: There was discussion of whether to change the media type names
	from message/global, message/global-delivery-status and message/global-headers
	to something else. The apparent consensus was to not change those names.
      </t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
	"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in

    <section title="UTF-8 Address Type" anchor="utf8addr">
      <t><xref target="RFC3464">An Extensible Message Format for Delivery Status Notifications</xref>
	defines the concept of an address type.
	The address format introduced in <xref target="RFC5335">Internationalized Email Headers</xref>
	is a new address type.
	The syntax for the new address type in the context of status notifications
	is specified at the end of this section.</t>
      <t>An <xref target='RFC2821'>SMTP</xref> server that advertises both the
	<xref target='RFC5336'>UTF8SMTP extension</xref> and the
	<xref target='RFC3461'>DSN extension</xref> MUST accept a UTF-8 address
	type in the ORCPT parameter including 8-bit UTF-8 characters.
	This address type also includes a 7-bit encoding suitable for use in a
	message/delivery-status body part or an ORCPT parameter sent to an SMTP
	server that does not advertise UTF8SMTP.
      </t>
      
      <t>This address type has 3 forms:
	utf-8-addr-xtext, utf-8-addr-unitext, and utf-8-address.
	The first 2 forms are 7-bit safe.
      </t>
      
      <t>The utf-8-address form is only suitable for use in newly defined protocols
	capable of native representation of 8-bit characters. That is, the utf-8-address
	form MUST NOT be used in the ORCPT parameter when the SMTP
	server doesn't advertise support for UTF8SMTP or the SMTP server supports
	UTF8SMTP, but the address contains US-ASCII characters not permitted in
	the ORCPT parameter (e.g., the ORCPT parameter forbids unencoded SP and the = character), or in a
	7-bit transport environment including a message/delivery-status
	Original-Recipient or Final-Recipient field.
	In the former case, the utf-8-addr-xtext form (see below) MUST be used instead;
	in the latter case, the utf-8-addr-unitext form MUST be used.
	
	The utf-8-address form MAY be used in the ORCPT parameter when the SMTP
	server also advertises support for UTF8SMTP and the address doesn't contain
	any US-ASCII characters not permitted in the ORCPT parameter. It SHOULD be used
	in a message/global-delivery-status Original-Recipient or Final-Recipient
	DSN field, or in an <xref target="RFC3798">Original-Recipient header field</xref>
	if the message is a UTF8SMTP message.
      </t>
      
      <t>In addition, the utf-8-addr-unitext form can be used anywhere where
	the utf-8-address form is allowed.
      </t>
      
      <t>When using in the ORCPT parameter, the UTF-8 address type requires that
	US-ASCII CTLs, SP, \, +, and = be encoded using xtext encoding as described
	in <xref target='RFC3461'/>. This is described by the utf-8-addr-xtext form
	in the ABNF below.
	Unicode characters MAY be included in a UTF-8 address type using a
	"\x{HEXPOINT}" syntax (EmbeddedUnicodeChar), where HEXPOINT is 2 to 6 hexadecimal digits.
	When sending data to a UTF8SMTP-capable server, native
	UTF-8 characters SHOULD be used instead of the EmbeddedUnicodeChar
	syntax described in details below.  When sending data to an SMTP server that
	does not advertise UTF8SMTP, then the EmbeddedUnicodeChar
	syntax MUST be used instead of UTF-8.
      </t>
      
      <t>When the ORCPT parameter is placed in a message/global-delivery-status
	Original-Recipient field, the utf-8-addr-xtext form of the UTF-8 address type SHOULD be
	converted to the utf-8-address form (see the ABNF below) by removing
	all xtext encoding first (which will result in the utf-8-addr-unitext form),
	followed by removal of the unitext encoding.
	However, if an address is labeled with the UTF-8 address type but
	does not conform to utf-8 syntax, then it MUST be copied into the
	message/global-delivery-status field without alteration.
      </t>
      
      <t>The ability to encode characters with the EmbeddedUnicodeChar
	encodings should be viewed as a transitional mechanism.  It is hoped
	that as systems lacking support for UTF8SMTP become less common over
	time, these encodings can eventually be phased out.

    <section title="UTF-8 Delivery Status Notifications" anchor="eai-dsn-format">
      <t>A traditional <xref target="RFC3464">delivery status notification</xref> comes
	in a three-part <xref target="RFC3462">multipart/report</xref> container,
	where the first part is human-readable text describing the error,
	the second part is a 7-bit-only message/delivery-status, and the optional third part
	is used for content (message/rfc822) or header (text/rfc822-headers) return.
	As the present DSN format does not permit returning of undeliverable UTF8SMTP messages,
	three new media types are needed.
      </t>
      
      <t>The first type, message/global-delivery-status, has the syntax of
	message/delivery-status with three modifications.  First, the charset
	for message/global-delivery-status is UTF-8, and thus any field MAY
	contain UTF-8 characters when appropriate (see the ABNF below).
	In particular, the Diagnostic-Code field MAY contain UTF-8 as described in
	<xref target='RFC5336'>UTF8SMTP</xref>;
	the Diagnostic-Code field SHOULD be in i-default language <xref target='DEFAULTLANG'/>.
	Second, systems generating a message/global-delivery-status
	body part SHOULD use the utf-8-address form of the UTF-8 address type for
	all addresses containing characters outside the US-ASCII repertoire.
	These systems SHOULD up-convert the utf-8-addr-xtext or the utf-8-addr-unitext
	form of a UTF-8 address type in the ORCPT parameter to the utf-8-address form
	of a UTF-8 address type in the Original-Recipient field.
	Third, a new optional field called Localized-Diagnostic is added.
	Each instance includes a language tag <xref target='LANGTAGS'/> and contains text in the
	specified language. This is equivalent to the text part of the Diagnostic-Code
	field. All instances of Localized-Diagnostic MUST use different language tags.
	The ABNF for message/global-delivery-status is specified below.

      <t>The third type, used for returning the headers, is
	message/global-headers and contains only the UTF-8 header fields of

	text/rfc822-headers. That is, implementations processing
	multipart/report MUST expect any combinations of the 6 media types mentioned above inside a
	multipart/report media type.
      </t>
      
      <t>All three new types will typically use the "8bit" Content-Transfer-Encoding.
	(In the event all content is 7-bit, the equivalent traditional types for
	delivery status notifications MAY be used. For example, if information in message/global-delivery-status
	part can be represented
	without any loss of information as message/delivery-status, then the message/delivery-status

	Note that <xref target='RFC5335'/> relaxed restriction from <xref target="RFC2046">MIME</xref>
	regarding use of Content-Transfer-Encoding in new "message" subtypes.
	This specification explicitly allows use of Content-Transfer-Encoding in

	(message/global-headers), same as for DSNs.
	The second part of the multipart/report uses a new media type,

	MAY contain UTF-8. These fields SHOULD be in i-default language <xref target='DEFAULTLANG'/>.)

	utf-8-addr-xtext or the utf-8-addr-unitext form of a UTF-8 address type
	in the ORCPT parameter to the corresponding utf-8-address form.

      <t>The MDN specification also defines the Disposition-Notification-To header

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="seccons">
      <t>Automated use of report types without authentication presents several security issues.  Forging negative reports presents the opportunity for denial-of-service attacks when the reports are used for automated maintenance of directories or mailing lists.  Forging positive reports may cause the sender to incorrectly believe a message was delivered when it was not.
      </t>
      <t>Malicious users can generate report structures designed to trigger coding flaws in report parsers.  Report parsers need to use secure coding techniques to avoid the risk of buffer overflow or denial-of-service attacks against parser coding mistakes.  Code reviews of such parsers are also recommended.
      </t> 
      <t>Malicious users of the email system regularly send messages with forged envelope return paths, and these messages trigger delivery status reports that result in a large amount of unwanted traffic on the Internet.  Many users choose to ignore delivery status notifications because they are usually the result of "blowback" from forged messages and thus never notice when messages they sent go undelivered.  As a result, support for correlation of delivery status and message disposition notification messages with sent-messages has become a critical feature of mail clients and possibly mail stores if the email infrastructure is to remain reliable.  In the short term, simply correlating message-IDs may be sufficient to distinguish true status notifications from those resulting from forged originator addresses.  But in the longer term, including cryptographic signature material that can securely associate the status notification with the original message is advisable.
      </t>
      <t>As this specification permits UTF-8 in additional fields, the security considerations of <xref target="RFC3629">UTF-8</xref> apply.

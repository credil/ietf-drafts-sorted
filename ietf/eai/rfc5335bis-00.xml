<abstract>
<t>	
Full internationalization of electronic mail requires not only the
capabilities to transmit non-ASCII content, to encode selected
information in specific header fields, and to use non-ASCII
characters in envelope addresses.  It also requires being able to
express those addresses and the information based on them in mail header fields.
This document specifies an variant of Internet mail that 
permits the use of Unicode encoded in UTF-8, rather than ASCII, as the base
form for Internet email header field.  This form is permitted in 
transmission only if authorized by an SMTP extension, as specified in an 
associated specification. This specification Updates section 6.4 of <xref target="RFC2045"/>
to conform with the requirements.

<t>	
Full internationalization of electronic mail requires several
capabilities:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
	<t>The capability to transmit non-ASCII content, provided for as part of 
	the basic MIME specification <xref target="RFC2045"/>, <xref target="RFC2046"/>.</t>
	
	<t>The capability to use international characters in envelope addresses, 
	discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-frmwrk-4952bis"/> and specified in

	<t>The capability to express those addresses, and information related to

</t>

<t>This document specifies an variant of Internet mail that
permits the use of Unicode encoded in UTF-8 <xref target="RFC3629" />, 
rather than ASCII, as the base form for Internet email header fields.
This form is permitted in transmission, if authorized by the SMTP extension
specified in <xref target="I-D.yao-eai-rfc5336bis"/> or by other transport 
mechanisms capable of processing it.

<section title="Relation to Other Standards" anchor="relations">
<t>
This document updates Section 6.4 of <xref target="RFC2045" />. It removes the blanket 
ban on applying a content-transfer-encoding to all subtypes of message/, 
and instead specifies that a composite subtype MAY specify whether or 
not a content-transfer-encoding can be used for that subtype, with 
"cannot be used" as the default.
</t>

<t> 
This document also updates <xref target="RFC5322" /> and MIME (<xref target="RFC2045" />), and 
people who participate in the experiment have to swich to this document.
</t>

<t>
Allowing use of a content-transfer-encoding on subtypes of messages 
is not limited to transmissions that are authorized by the SMTP
extension specified in <xref target="I-D.yao-eai-rfc5336bis"/>.
Message/global (see <xref target="utf8smtp" />) permits use of a content-transfer-encoding. 

</t> 
</section>
</section>

<section title="Background and History">
<t>Mailbox names often represent the names of human users. Many of these
users throughout the world have names that are not normally expressed
with just the ASCII repertoire of characters, and would like to use more
or less their real names in their mailbox names. These users
are also likely to use non-ASCII text in their common names and subjects
of email messages, both received and sent.
This protocol specifies UTF-8 as the encoding to represent email header field bodies.</t>

<t>The traditional format of email messages

<xref target="RFC5322"/> allows only ASCII characters in the
header fields of messages. This prevents users from having email addresses
that contain non-ASCII characters. It further forces non-ASCII text in
common names, comments, and in free text (such as in the Subject: field)
to be encoded (as required by MIME format <xref target="RFC2047" />). This 
specification describes a change to the email message format that is related
to the SMTP message transport change described in the  associated document
<xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-frmwrk-4952bis"/> and <xref target="I-D.yao-eai-rfc5336bis"/>, and that
allows non-ASCII characters in most email header fields. These changes affect 
SMTP clients, SMTP servers, mail user agents (MUAs), list expanders, 
gateways to other media, and all other processes that parse or handle 
email messages.</t>

<t>As specified in <xref target="I-D.yao-eai-rfc5336bis"/>,
an SMTP protocol extension "UTF8SMTPbis" is used to prevent the
transmission of messages with UTF-8 header fields to systems that
cannot handle such messages. 
[[Note in Draft: Keyword related to UTF8SMTP  will be decided by WG before publication.]]

</t>

<t>
Use of this SMTP extension helps prevent the introduction of such
messages into message stores that might misinterpret, improperly display,
or mangle such messages. It should be noted that using an ESMTP extension
does not prevent transferring email messages with UTF-8 header fields to 
other systems that use the email format for messages and that may not be 
upgraded,  such as unextended POP and IMAP servers. Changes to these 
protocols to handle UTF-8 header fields are addressed in <xref target="RFC5721"/>-bis
and <xref target="RFC5738"/>-bis.
</t>

<t>The objective for this protocol is to allow UTF-8 in email header fields.
<!--
    Issues such as how to handle messages containing UTF-8 header fields that
    have to be delivered to systems that have not been upgraded to support
    this capability are discussed in <xref target="RFC5504"/>.
	-->
</t>

</section>

<section title="Terminology">
<t>A plain ASCII string is also a valid UTF-8 string; see <xref target="RFC3629"/>.
In this document, ordinary ASCII characters are UTF-8 characters
if they are in headers which contain &lt;utf8-xtra-char&gt;s.</t>
<t>
Unless otherwise noted, all terms used here are defined in
<xref target="RFC5321"/>, <xref target="RFC5322"/>, 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-frmwrk-4952bis" />,or <xref target="I-D.yao-eai-rfc5336bis"/>.
</t>
<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.
</t>
</section>


<section title="Changes on Message Header Fields">
<t>SMTP clients can send header fields in UTF-8 format, if the 
UTF8SMTPbis extension is advertised by the SMTP server or is permitted by other 
transport mechanisms. </t>

<t>

This protocol does NOT change the <xref target="RFC5322"/> rules for defining header field 
names. The bodies of header fields are allowed to contain UTF-8 characters, 
but the header field names themselves must contain only ASCII characters.
</t>
<t>
	To permit UTF-8 characters in field values, the header definition in
<xref target="RFC5322"/> must be extended to support the new format.  The 
following ABNF is defined to substitute those definitions in <xref target="RFC5322"/>.
</t>
<t>
	The syntax rules not covered in this section remain as defined in <xref target="RFC5322"/>.
</t>

<section title="UTF-8 Syntax and Normalization">
<t>UTF-8 characters can be defined in terms of octets using the following 
ABNF <xref target="RFC5234"/>, taken from <xref target="RFC3629"/>:
<figure>
  <artwork><![CDATA[
UTF8-xtra-char  =   UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4

UTF8-2          =   %xC2-DF UTF8-tail

UTF8-3          =   %xE0 %xA0-BF UTF8-tail /
                    %xE1-EC 2(UTF8-tail) /
                    %xED %x80-9F UTF8-tail /
                    %xEE-EF 2(UTF8-tail)

UTF8-tail       =   %x80-BF

</figure>
These are normatively defined in <xref target="RFC3629"/>, but kept in this document for reasons of convenience.
</t>	
<t>	
See <xref target="RFC5198"/> for a discussion of normalization; the use of normalization form 
NFC is RECOMMENDED. Actually, if one is going to do internationalization properly, one of 
the most often-cited goals is to permit people to spell their names correctly. Since many 
mailbox local parts reflect personal names, that principle applies as well. And NFKC is 
not recommended because it may lose information that is needed to correctly spell some names 
except in unusual circumstances.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Changes on MIME Headers" anchor="change_on_mime_header">
<t>
   This specification updates Section 6.4 of <xref target="RFC2045"/>. 
   <xref target="RFC2045"/> prohibits applying a content-transfer-encoding  
   to all subtypes of message/.  This specification relaxes the rule -- it allows
   newly defined MIME types to permit content-transfer-encoding, and it allows
   content-transfer-encoding for message/global (see <xref target="utf8smtp"/>).
</t>



<t>
   Background: Normally, transfer of message/global will be done in
   8-bit-clean channels, and body parts will have "identity" encodings,
   that is, no decoding is necessary.

   In the case where a message containing a message/global is downgraded
   from 8-bit to 7-bit as described in <xref target="RFC1652"/>, an encoding
   may be applied to the message; if the message travels multiple times 
   between a 7-bit environment and an environment implementing UTF8SMTPbis,
   multiple levels of encoding may occur. This is expected to be rarely 
   seen in practice, and the potential complexity of other ways of dealing
   with the issue are thought to be larger than the complexity of allowing 
   nested encodings where necessary.
</t>

</section>
<section title="Syntax Extensions to RFC 5322" anchor="syntax_change">
<t>The following rules are intended to extend the corresponding rules in 
<xref target="RFC5322"/> in order to allow UTF-8 characters.
<figure>

comment =   "(" *([FWS] utf8-ccontent) [FWS] ")"

word    =   utf8-atom / utf8-quoted-string
  ]]></artwork>
</figure>
This means that all the <xref target="RFC5322"/> constructs that build upon these will
permit UTF-8 characters, including comments and quoted strings. We do not change the syntax 
of &lt;atext&gt; in order to allow UTF-8 characters in &lt;addr-spec&gt;.  This would 
also allow UTF-8 characters in &lt;message-id&gt;, which is not allowed due to the limitation 
described in <xref target="TraceFieldLimit" />. Instead, &lt;utf8-atext&gt; is added to meet this requirement.

To allow the use of UTF-8 in a Content-Description header field 
<xref target="RFC2045" />, the following syntax is used:
<figure>
  <artwork><![CDATA[
description   = "Content-Description:" unstructured CRLF
  ]]></artwork>
</figure>
The &lt;utext&gt;  syntax is extended above to allow UTF-8 in all

&lt;unstructured&gt; header fields.</t> 

<t>
Note, however, this does not remove any constraint on the
character set of protocol elements;
for instance, all the allowed values for timezone in the Date: headers
are still expressed in ASCII. 
And also, none of this revised syntax changes what is allowed in a
&lt;message-id&gt;, which will still remain in pure ASCII.

	"For" fields containing internationalized addresses are allowed, by use

interoperate with the installed base, but with different properties.  
Systems unaware of international headers will typically treat a 
message/global body part as an unknown attachment, while they will 
understand the structure of a message/rfc822.  However, systems that
understand message/global will provide functionality superior to the

	or exceed storage 
	allotments. Also, they must take care, when comparing, to use the entire
	lengths of the addresses.
</t>
<t>
	In this specification, a user could provide an ASCII alternative address 
	for a non-ASCII address. However, it is possible these two addresses go to 
	different mailboxes, or even different people. 
	This configuration may be based on a user's personal choice or on
	administration policy. We recognize that if ASCII and non-ASCII email is
	delivered to two different destinations, based on MTA capability, this may
	violate the principle of least astonishment, but this is not a "protocol problem".

The security impact of UTF-8 headers on email signature systems such as 
Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM), S/MIME, and OpenPGP is discussed in 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-frmwrk-4952bis"/>, Section 14.  
<!--
A subsequent 
document <xref target="RFC5504"/> will cover the impact of downgrading on 
these systems.

  <abstract>
    <t>This document describes minimal version of the Internet Key
    Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol. IKEv2 is a component of IPsec
    used for performing mutual authentication and establishing and
    maintaining Security Associations (SAs). IKEv2 includes several
    optional features, which are not needed in minimal
    implementations. This document describes what is required from the
    minimal implementation, and also describes various optimizations
    which can be done. The protocol described here is compliant with
    full IKEv2 with exception that this document describes mainly
    shared secret authentication (IKEv2 requires support for
    certificate authentication in addition to shared secret
    authentication).</t>

    <t> This document does not update or modify RFC 5996, but provides
    more compact description of the minimal version of the protocol.
    If this document and RFC 5996 conflicts then RFC 5996 is the
    authoritative description.</t>
  </abstract>

  <section title='Introduction'>
    <t>This document tells what minimal IKEv2 implementation could
    look like. Minimal IKEv2 implementation only supports initiator
    end of the protocol. It only supports the initial IKE_SA_INIT and
    IKE_AUTH exchanges and does not initiate any other exchanges. It
    also replies with empty (or error) message to all incoming
    requests.</t>

    <t>This means that most of the optional features of IKEv2 are left
    out: NAT Traversal, IKE SA rekey, Child SA Rekey, Multiple Child
    SAs, Deleting Child / IKE SAs, Configuration payloads, EAP
    authentication, COOKIEs etc.</t>

    <t>Some optimizations can be done because of limited set of
    supported features, and this text should not be considered for
    generic IKEv2 implementations (for example Message IDs can be done
    as specified as implementation is only sending out IKE_SA_INIT and
    IKE_AUTH request, and do not ever send any other request).</t>

    <t>This document should be stand-alone, meaning everything needed to
    implement IKEv2 is copied here except the description of the
    cryptographic algorithms. The IKEv2 specification has lots of background
    information and rationale which has been omitted from this
    document.</t>

    <t>Numerous additional numeric values from IANA registries have
    been omitted from this document, only those which are of interest
    for minimal implementation are listed in this document.</t>

    <t>The main body of this document describes how to use the shared
    secret authentication in the IKEv2, as it is easiest to implement.
    In some cases that is not enough and the <xref
    target='raw-public-keys'/> describes how to use Raw Public keys
    instead of shared secret authentication.</t>

    <t>For more information check the full IKEv2 specification in RFC
    5996 <xref target='RFC5996'/> and <xref target='IKEV2IANA'/>.</t>

    <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
    in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
    target='RFC2119'/>.</t>
    
    <section title='Use Cases'>
      <t>One use case for this kind of minimal implementation is in
      small devices doing machine to machine communication. In such
      environments the node initiating connections is usually very
      small and the other end of the communication channel is some
      kind of larger device. </t>

      <t>An example of the small initiating node could be an remote
      garage door opener device. I.e. device having buttons which open
      and close garage door, and which connects to the home area
      network server over wireless link. </t>

      <t>Another example of the such device is some kind of sensor
      device, for example room temperature sensor, which sends
      periodic temperature data to some centralized node.</t>

      <t>Those devices are usually sleeping long times, and only wakes
      up because of user interaction or periodically. The data
      transfer is always initiated from the sleeping node and after
      they send packets there might be ACKs or other packets coming
      back before they go back to sleep. If some data needs to be
      transferred from server node to the small device, it can be
      implemented by polling, i.e. small node periodically polls for
      the server to see if it for example have some configuration
      changes or similar.</t>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section title='Exchanges'>

    <section anchor='initial-exchange' title='Initial Exchange'>
      <t>All IKEv2 communications consist of pairs of messages: a
      request and a response. The pair is called an "exchange", and is
      sometimes called a "request/response pair". Every request
      requires a response.</t>

      <t>For every pair of IKEv2 messages, the initiator is
      responsible for retransmission in the event of a timeout. The
      responder MUST never retransmit a response unless it receives a
      retransmission of the request.</t>

      <t>IKEv2 is a reliable protocol: the initiator MUST retransmit a
      request until it either receives a corresponding response or
      deems the IKE SA to have failed. A retransmission from the
      initiator MUST be bitwise identical to the original request.
      Retransmission times MUST increase exponentially.</t>

      <t>IKEv2 is run over UDP port 500. All IKEv2 implementations
      MUST be able to send, receive, and process IKEv2 messages that
      are up to 1280 octets long. An implementation MUST accept
      incoming requests even if the source port is not 500, and MUST
      respond to the address and port from which the request was
      received.</t>

      <t>The minimal implementation of IKEv2 only uses first two
      exchanges called IKE_SA_INIT and IKE_AUTH. Those are used to
      create the IKE SA and the first child SA. In addition to those
      messages minimal IKEv2 implementation need to understand
      CREATE_CHILD_SA request so it can reply with CREATE_CHILD_SA
      error response saying NO_ADDITIONAL_SAS to it, and understand
      INFORMATIONAL request so much, it can reply with empty
      INFORMATIONAL response to it. There is no requirement to be able
      to respond to any other requests.</t>

      <t>All messages following the IKE_SA_INIT exchange are
      cryptographically protected using the cryptographic algorithms
      and keys negotiated in the IKE_SA_INIT exchange.</t>

      <t>Every IKEv2 message contains a Message ID as part of its
      fixed header. This Message ID is used to match up requests and
      responses, and to identify retransmissions of messages.</t>

      <t>Minimal implementation need only support of being initiator,
      so it does not ever need to send any other request as one
      IKE_SA_INIT, and one IKE_AUTH message. As those messages have
      fixed Message IDs (0 and 1) it does not need to keep track of
      its own Message IDs for outgoing requests after that.</t>

      <t>Minimal implementations can also optimize Message ID handling
      of the incoming requests, as they do not need to protect
      incoming requests against replays. This is possible because
      minimal implementation will only return error or empty
      notifications replies to incoming requests. This means that any
      of those incoming requests do not have any effect on the minimal
      implementation, thus processing them again does not cause any
      harm. Because of this the minimal implementation can always
      answer to request coming in, with the same Message ID than what
      the request had and then forget the request/response pair
      immediately. This means there is no need to keep any kind of
      track of Message IDs of the incoming requests.</t>

      <t>In the following descriptions, the payloads contained in the
      message are indicated by names as listed below.</t>

]]></artwork></figure>

      <t>The initial exchanges are as follows:</t>
    
      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Initiator                         Responder
-------------------------------------------------------------------
HDR(SPIi=xxx, SPIr=0, IKE_SA_INIT,
    Flags: Initiator, Message ID=0),
    SAi1, KEi, Ni  -->

                   <--  HDR(SPIi=xxx, SPIr=yyy, IKE_SA_INIT,
                            Flags: Response, Message ID=0),
                            SAr1, KEr, Nr, [CERTREQ]
]]></artwork></figure>

      <t>HDR contains the Security Parameter Indexes (SPIs), version
      numbers, and flags of various sorts. Each endpoint chooses one
      of the two SPIs and MUST choose them so as to be unique
      identifiers of an IKE SA. An SPI value of zero is special: it
      indicates that the remote SPI value is not yet known by the
      sender.</t>

      <t>Incoming IKEv2 packets are mapped to an IKE SA only using the
      packet's SPI, not using (for example) the source IP address of
      the packet.</t>

      <t>The SAi1 payload states the cryptographic algorithms the
      initiator supports for the IKE SA. The KEi and KEr payload
      contain Diffie-Hellman values and Ni and Nr are the nonces. The
      SAr1 contains chosen cryptographic suite from initiator's
      offered choices. Minimal implementation using shared secrets
      will ignore the CERTREQ payload.</t>

      <t>Minimal implementation will most likely support exactly one
      set of cryptographic algorithms, meaning the SAi1 payload will
      be static. It needs to check that the SAr1 received matches the
      proposal it sent.</t>

      <t>At this point in the negotiation, each party can generate
      SKEYSEED, from which all keys are derived for that IKE SA.</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
SKEYSEED = prf(Ni | Nr, g^ir)

{SK_d | SK_ai | SK_ar | SK_ei | SK_er | SK_pi | SK_pr }
                = prf+ (SKEYSEED, Ni | Nr | SPIi | SPIr )

prf+ (K,S) = T1 | T2 | T3 | T4 | ...

where:
T1 = prf (K, S | 0x01)
T2 = prf (K, T1 | S | 0x02)
T3 = prf (K, T2 | S | 0x03)
T4 = prf (K, T3 | S | 0x04)
...
]]></artwork></figure>

      <t>(indicating that the quantities SK_d, SK_ai, SK_ar, SK_ei,
      SK_er, SK_pi, and SK_pr are taken in order from the generated
      bits of the prf+). g^ir is the shared secret from the ephemeral
      Diffie-Hellman exchange. g^ir is represented as a string of
      octets in big endian order padded with zeros if necessary to
      make it the length of the modulus. Ni and Nr are the nonces,
      stripped of any headers. </t>

      <t>The SK_d is used for deriving new keys for the Child SAs. The
      SK_ai and SK_ar are used as a key to the integrity protection
      algorithm for authenticating the component messages of
      subsequent exchanges. The SK_ei and SK_er are used for
      encrypting (and of course decrypting) all subsequent exchanges.
      The SK_pi and SK_pr are used when generating an AUTH payload.
      The lengths of SK_d, SK_pi, and SK_pr MUST be the preferred key
      length of the PRF agreed upon.</t>

      <t>A separate SK_e and SK_a is computed for each direction. The
      keys used to protect messages from the original initiator are
      SK_ai and SK_ei. The keys used to protect messages in the other
      direction are SK_ar and SK_er. The notation SK { ... } indicates
      that these payloads are encrypted and integrity protected using
      that direction's SK_e and SK_a.</t>

    
      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Initiator                         Responder
-------------------------------------------------------------------
HDR(SPIi=xxx, SPIr=yyy, IKE_AUTH,
    Flags: Initiator, Message ID=1),
    SK {IDi, AUTH, SAi2, TSi, TSr,
        N(INITIAL_CONTACT)}  -->

                  <--  HDR(SPIi=xxx, SPIr=yyy, IKE_AUTH, Flags:
                              Response, Message ID=1),
                              SK {IDr, AUTH, SAr2, TSi, TSr}
]]></artwork></figure>

      <t>The initiator asserts its identity with the IDi payload,
      proves knowledge of the secret corresponding to IDi and
      integrity protects the contents of the first message using the
      AUTH payload. The responder asserts its identity with the IDr
      payload, authenticates its identity and protects the integrity
      of the second message with the AUTH payload.</t>

      <t>As minimal implementation usually has only one host where it
      connects, and that means it has only one shared secret. This
      means it does not need to care about IDr payload that much. If
      the other end sends AUTH payload which initiator can verify
      using the shared secret it has, then it knows the other end is
      the peer it was configured to talk to.</t>

      <t>In the IKE_AUTH initiator sends SA offer(s) in the SAi2
      payload, and the proposed Traffic Selectors for the proposed
      Child SA in the TSi and TSr payloads. The responder replies with
      the accepted offer in an SAr2 payload, and selected Traffic
      Selectors. The selected Traffic Selectors may be a subset of
      what the initiator proposed.</t>

      <t>In the minimal implementation both SA payloads and TS
      payloads are going to be mostly static. The SA payload will have
      the SPI value used in the ESP, but the algorithms are most
      likely going to be the one and only supported set. The TS
      payloads on the initiator end will most likely say from any to
      any, i.e. full wildcard ranges, or from the local IP to the
      remote IP. In the wildcard case the server quite often narrow
      the range down to the one IP address pair. Using single IP
      address pair as a traffic selectors when sending IKE_AUTH will
      simplify processing as then server will either accept that pair
      or return error. If wildcard ranges are used, there is
      possibility that server narrows the range to some other range
      than what was intended.</t>

      <t>The IKE_AUTH (and IKE_SA_INIT) responses may contain multiple
      status notification payloads which can be ignored by minimal
      implementation. There can also be Vendor ID, Certificate,
      Certificate Request or Configuration payloads, but any payload
      unknown to minimal implementation can simply be skipped over
      (response messages cannot have critical unsupported
      payloads).</t>

      <t>The exchange above includes N(INITIAL_CONTACT) notification
      in the request as that is quite commonly sent by the minimal
      implementation. It indicates to the other end that the initiator
      does not have any other IKE SAs between them, and if there is
      any left from previous runs they can be deleted. As minimal
      implementation does not delete IKE SAs by sending IKE SA delete,
      this will help server to clean up leftover state.</t>

      <t>When using shared secret authentication, the peers are
      authenticated by having each calculating a MAC over a block of
      data:</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
For the initiator:
   AUTH = prf( prf(Shared Secret, "Key Pad for IKEv2"),
                    <InitiatorSignedOctets>)
For the responder:
   AUTH = prf( prf(Shared Secret, "Key Pad for IKEv2"),
                    <ResponderSignedOctets>)
]]></artwork></figure>

      <t>The string "Key Pad for IKEv2" is 17 ASCII characters without
      null termination. The implementation can precalculate the inner
      prf and only store the output of it. This is possible because
      minimal IKEv2 implementation usually only supports one PRF.</t>

      <t>The initiator signs the first message (IKE_SA_INIT request),
      starting with the first octet of the first SPI in the header and
      ending with the last octet of the last payload in that first
      message. Appended to this (for purposes of computing the
      signature) are the responder's nonce Nr, and the value
      prf(SK_pi, IDi').</t>

      <t>For the responder, the octets to be signed start with the
      first octet of the first SPI in the header of the second message
      (IKE_SA_INIT response) and end with the last octet of the last
      payload in that second message. Appended to this are the
      initiator's nonce Ni, and the value prf(SK_pr, IDr').</t>

      <t>In these calculations, IDi' and IDr' are the entire ID
      payloads excluding the fixed header and the Ni, and Nr are only
      the value, not the payload containing it. Note that neither the
      nonce Ni/Nr nor the value prf(SK_pr, IDr')/prf(SK_pi, IDi') are
      transmitted.</t>

      <t>The initiator's signed octets can be described as:</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
InitiatorSignedOctets = RealMessage1 | NonceRData | MACedIDForI
GenIKEHDR = [ four octets 0 if using port 4500 ] | RealIKEHDR
RealIKEHDR =  SPIi | SPIr |  . . . | Length
RealMessage1 = RealIKEHDR | RestOfMessage1
NonceRPayload = PayloadHeader | NonceRData
InitiatorIDPayload = PayloadHeader | RestOfInitIDPayload
RestOfInitIDPayload = IDType | RESERVED | InitIDData
MACedIDForI = prf(SK_pi, RestOfInitIDPayload)
]]></artwork></figure>

      <t>The responder's signed octets can be described as:</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
ResponderSignedOctets = RealMessage2 | NonceIData | MACedIDForR
GenIKEHDR = [ four octets 0 if using port 4500 ] | RealIKEHDR
RealIKEHDR =  SPIi | SPIr |  . . . | Length
RealMessage2 = RealIKEHDR | RestOfMessage2
NonceIPayload = PayloadHeader | NonceIData
ResponderIDPayload = PayloadHeader | RestOfRespIDPayload
RestOfRespIDPayload = IDType | RESERVED | RespIDData
MACedIDForR = prf(SK_pr, RestOfRespIDPayload)
]]></artwork></figure>

      <t>Note that all of the payloads inside the RestOfMessageX are
      included under the signature, including any payload types not
      listed in this document.</t>

      <t>The initiator might also get unauthenticated response back
      having notification payload with error code inside. As that
      error code will be unauthenticated and may be faked, there is no
      need to do anything for those. Minimal implementation can simply
      ignore those errors, and retransmit its request until it times
      out and if that happens then the IKE SA (and Child SA) creation
      failed.</t>

      <t>Responder might also reply with IKE_AUTH response packet
      which do not contain payloads needed to set up Child SA (SAr2,
      TSi and TSr), but contains AUTH payload and an error. As minimal
      implementation probably do not support multiple SAs nor sending
      the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges the IKE SA is useless for
      initiator. It can delete the IKE SA and start over from the
      beginning (which might fail again if this is configuration
      error, or it might succeed if this was temporal failure).</t>

    </section>

    <section title='Other Exchanges'>

      <t>Minimal implementation MUST be able to reply to INFORMATIONAL
      request by sending empty response back:</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Initiator                         Responder

      <t>Minimal implementation also MUST be able to reply to incoming
      CREATE_CHILD_SA requests. Typical implementation will reject the
      CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges by sending NO_ADDITIONAL_SAS error
      notify back:</t>

HDR(SPIi=xxx, SPIr=yyy, CREATE_CHILD_SA,
    Flags: Initiator | Response, Message ID=m),
    SK {N(NO_ADDITIONAL_SAS)}  -->
]]></artwork></figure>

      <t>Note, that INFORMATIONAL and CREATE_CHILD_SA requests might
      contain unsupported critical payloads, in which case complient
      implementation MUST ignore the request, and send response
      message back having the UNSUPPORTED_CRITICAL_PAYLOAD
      notification. That notification payload data contains one-octet
      payload type of the unsupported critical payload.</t>

    <section title='Generating Keying Material'>

      <t>Keying material for Child SA created by the IKE_AUTH exchange
      is generated as follows:</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
KEYMAT = prf+(SK_d, Ni | Nr)

      <t>Where Ni and Nr are the nonces from the IKE_SA_INIT
      exchange.</t>

      <t>A single CHILD_SA negotiation may result in multiple Security
      Associations. ESP and AH SAs exist in pairs (one in each
      direction), so two SAs are created in a single Child SA
      negotiation for them. The keying material for each Child SA MUST
      be taken from the expanded KEYMAT using the following rules:</t>
      
      <t><list style = 'symbols'>

        <t>All keys for SAs carrying data from the initiator to the
        responder are taken before SAs going from the responder to the
        initiator.</t>

        <t>If an IPsec protocol requires multiple keys, the order in
        which they are taken from the SA's keying material needs to be
        described in the protocol's specification. For ESP and AH,
        [IPSECARCH] defines the order, namely: the encryption key (if
        any) MUST be taken from the first bits and the integrity key
        (if any) MUST be taken from the remaining bits.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>Each cryptographic algorithm takes a fixed number of bits of
      keying material specified as part of the algorithm, or
      negotiated in SA payloads.</t>

  <section title='Conformance Requirements'>

    <t>For an implementation to be called conforming to RFC 5996
    specification, it MUST be possible to configure it to accept the
    following:</t>

    <t><list style='symbols'>
      
      <t>Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates
      containing and signed by RSA keys of size 1024 or 2048 bits,
      where the ID passed is any of ID_KEY_ID, ID_FQDN,
      ID_RFC822_ADDR, or ID_DER_ASN1_DN.</t>

      <t>Shared key authentication where the ID passed is any of
      ID_KEY_ID, ID_FQDN, or ID_RFC822_ADDR.</t>

      <t>Authentication where the responder is authenticated using
      PKIX Certificates and the initiator is authenticated using
      shared key authentication.</t>
    </list></t>

    <t>This document only supports the second bullet, it does not
    support PKIX certificates at all. As full RFC5996 responders must
    also support that shared key authentication, this allows minimal
    implementation to be able to interoperate with all RFC 5996
    compliant implementations.</t>

    <t>PKIX certificates are left out from the minimal implementation
    as those would add quite a lot of complexity to the
    implementation. The actual code changes needed in the IKEv2
    protocol are small, but the certificate validation code would be
    more complex than the whole minimal IKEv2 implementation itself.
    If public key based authentication is needed for scalability
    reasons, then raw public keys would probably be the best compromize
    (see <xref target='raw-public-keys'/>).</t>

    security considerations from it also apply to this document.</t>

  <section title='Header and Payload Formats'>

    <t>This appendix describes actual packet payload formats. This is
    required to make the document self contained. The descriptions are
    mostly copied from the RFC5996 and more information can be found
    from there.</t>

    <t>Various payload contains RESERVED fields and those MUST be sent
    as zero and MUST be ignored on receipt.</t>
    
    <t>All multi-octet fields representing integers are laid out in
    big endian order (also known as "most significant byte first", or
    "network byte order").</t>

    <section title='The IKE Header'>

      <t>Each IKEv2 message begins with the IKE header, denoted HDR in
      this document. Following the header are one or more IKE payloads
      each identified by a "Next Payload" field in the preceding
      payload. Payloads are identified in the order in which they
      appear in an IKE message by looking in the "Next Payload" field
      in the IKE header, and subsequently according to the "Next
      Payload" field in the IKE payload itself until a "Next Payload"
      field of zero indicates that no payloads follow. If a payload of
      type "Encrypted" is found, that payload is decrypted and its
      contents parsed as additional payloads. An Encrypted payload
      MUST be the last payload in a packet and an Encrypted payload
      MUST NOT contain another Encrypted payload.</t>

      <t>The format of the IKE header is shown in Figure 1.</t>

        <t>Next Payload (1 octet) - Identifier for the payload type of
        the next payload in the message. If the current payload is the
        last in the message, then this field will be 0. This field
        provides a "chaining" capability whereby additional payloads
        can be added to a message by appending each one to the end of
        the message and setting the "Next Payload" field of the
        preceding payload to indicate the new payload's type. An
        Encrypted payload, which must always be the last payload of a
        message, is an exception. It contains data structures in the
        format of additional payloads. In the header of an Encrypted
        payload, the Next Payload field is set to the payload type of
        the first contained payload (instead of 0); conversely, the
        Next Payload field of the last contained payload is set to
        zero). The payload type values needed for minimal

    <section title='Security Association Payload'>

      <t>The Security Association payload, denoted SA in this
      document, is used to negotiate attributes of a Security
      Association.</t>

      <t>An SA payload consists of one or more proposals. Each
      proposal includes one protocol. Each protocol contains one or
      more transforms -- each specifying a cryptographic algorithm.
      Each transform contains zero or more attributes (attributes are
      needed only if the Transform ID does not completely specify the
      cryptographic algorithm, currently only attribute is key length
      attribute for variable length ciphers, meaning there is exactly
      zero or one attribute).</t>

      <t>The responder MUST choose a single suite, which may be any
      subset of the SA proposal following the rules below.</t>

      <t>Each proposal contains one protocol. If a proposal is
      accepted, the SA response MUST contain the same protocol. Each
      IPsec protocol proposal contains one or more transforms. Each
      transform contains a Transform Type. The accepted cryptographic
      suite MUST contain exactly one transform of each type included
      in the proposal. For example: if an ESP proposal includes
      transforms ENCR_3DES, ENCR_AES w/keysize 128, ENCR_AES w/keysize
      256, AUTH_HMAC_MD5, and AUTH_HMAC_SHA, the accepted suite MUST
      contain one of the ENCR_ transforms and one of the AUTH_
      transforms. Thus, six combinations are acceptable.</t>

      <t>Minimal implementation can create very simple SA proposal,
      i.e. include one proposal, which contains exactly one transform
      for each transform type. It is important to only include one
      Diffie-Hellman group in proposal, so there is no need to do
      INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD processing in responses.</t>

      <t>When parsing an SA, an implementation MUST check that the
      total Payload Length is consistent with the payload's internal
      lengths and counts. Proposals, Transforms, and Attributes each
      have their own variable-length encodings. They are nested such
      that the Payload Length of an SA includes the combined contents
      of the SA, Proposal, Transform, and Attribute information. The
      length of a Proposal includes the lengths of all Transforms and
      Attributes it contains. The length of a Transform includes the
      lengths of all Attributes it contains.</t>

      <t>Each Proposal/Protocol structure is followed by one or more
      transform structures. The number of different transforms is
      generally determined by the Protocol. AH generally has two
      transforms: Extended Sequence Numbers (ESNs) and an integrity
      check algorithm. ESP generally has three: ESN, an encryption
      algorithm, and an integrity check algorithm. IKEv2 generally has
      four transforms: a Diffie-Hellman group, an integrity check
      algorithm, a PRF algorithm, and an encryption algorithm. For
      each Protocol, the set of permissible transforms is assigned
      Transform ID numbers, which appear in the header of each
      transform.</t>

      <t>If there are multiple transforms with the same Transform
      Type, the proposal is an OR of those transforms. If there are
      multiple transforms with different Transform Types, the proposal
      is an AND of the different groups.</t>

      <t>A given transform MAY have one or more Attributes. Attributes
      are necessary when the transform can be used in more than one
      way, as when an encryption algorithm has a variable key size.
      The transform would specify the algorithm and the attribute
      would specify the key size. To propose alternate values for an
      attribute (for example, multiple key sizes for the AES
      encryption algorithm), an implementation MUST include multiple
      transforms with the same Transform Type each with a single
      Attribute.</t>

      <t>A Key Exchange payload is constructed by copying one's
      Diffie-Hellman public value into the "Key Exchange Data" portion
      of the payload. The length of the Diffie-Hellman public value

      the length of the prime modulus over which the exponentiation
      was performed, prepending zero bits to the value if
      necessary.</t>

      <t>The Diffie-Hellman Group Num identifies the Diffie-Hellman
      group in which the Key Exchange Data was computed. This
      Diffie-Hellman Group Num MUST match a Diffie-Hellman group

    <section title='Identification Payloads'>
      
      <t>The Identification payloads, denoted IDi and IDr in this
      document, allow peers to assert an identity to one another. When
      using the ID_IPV4_ADDR/ID_IPV6_ADDR identity types in IDi/IDr
      payloads, IKEv2 does not require this address to match the
      address in the IP header of IKEv2 packets, or anything in the
      TSi/TSr payloads. The contents of IDi/IDr are used purely to
      fetch the policy and authentication data related to the other
      party. In minimal implementation it might be easiest to always
      use KEY_ID type. This allows the ID payload to be static. Using
      IP address has problems in environments where IP addresses are
      dynamically allocated.</t>

ID_RFC822_ADDR                      3
   A fully-qualified RFC 822 email address string.  An example of a
   ID_RFC822_ADDR is "jsmith@example.com".  The string MUST NOT

ID_IPV6_ADDR                        5

ID_KEY_ID                           11
   An opaque octet stream that may be used to pass vendor-
   specific information necessary to do certain proprietary
   types of identification. Minimal implementation might use
   this type to send out serial number or similar device
   specific unique static identification data for the device.

        <t>Number of TSs (1 octet) - Number of Traffic Selectors being
        provided.</t>

        <t>Traffic Selectors (variable length) - One or more
        individual Traffic Selectors.</t>

      </list></t>

      <t>The length of the Traffic Selector payload includes the TS
      header and all the Traffic Selectors.</t>

      <t>There is no requirement that TSi and TSr contain the same
      number of individual Traffic Selectors. Thus, they are
      interpreted as follows: a packet matches a given TSi/TSr if it
      matches at least one of the individual selectors in TSi, and at
      least one of the individual selectors in TSr.</t>

      <t>Two TS payloads appear in each of the messages in the
      exchange that creates a Child SA pair. Each TS payload contains
      one or more Traffic Selectors. Each Traffic Selector consists of
      an address range (IPv4 or IPv6), a port range, and an IP
      protocol ID.</t>

      <t>The first of the two TS payloads is known as TSi (Traffic
      Selector- initiator). The second is known as TSr (Traffic
      Selector-responder). TSi specifies the source address of traffic
      forwarded from (or the destination address of traffic forwarded
      to) the initiator of the Child SA pair. TSr specifies the
      destination address of the traffic forwarded to (or the source
      address of the traffic forwarded from) the responder of the
      Child SA pair.</t>

      <t>IKEv2 allows the responder to choose a subset of the traffic
      proposed by the initiator.</t>

      <t>When the responder chooses a subset of the traffic proposed
      by the initiator, it narrows the Traffic Selectors to some
      subset of the initiator's proposal (provided the set does not
      become the null set). If the type of Traffic Selector proposed
      is unknown, the responder ignores that Traffic Selector, so that
      the unknown type is not returned in the narrowed set.</t>

      <t>To enable the responder to choose the appropriate range, if
      the initiator has requested the SA due to a data packet, the
      initiator SHOULD include as the first Traffic Selector in each
      of TSi and TSr a very specific Traffic Selector including the
      addresses in the packet triggering the request. If the initiator
      creates the Child SA pair not in response to an arriving packet,
      but rather, say, upon startup, then there may be no specific
      addresses the initiator prefers for the initial tunnel over any
      other. In that case, the first values in TSi and TSr can be
      ranges rather than specific values.</t>

      <t>As minimal implementations might only support one SA, the
      traffic selectors will usually be from initiator's IP address to
      responders IP address (i.e. no port or protocol selectors and
      only one range).</t>

        <t>Initialization Vector - For CBC mode ciphers, the length of

        <t>Pad Length is the length of the Padding field. The sender
        SHOULD set the Pad Length to the minimum value that makes the
        combination of the payloads, the Padding, and the Pad Length a
        multiple of the block size, but the recipient MUST accept any
        length that results in proper alignment. This field is
        encrypted with the negotiated cipher.</t>

        <t>Integrity Checksum Data is the cryptographic checksum of
        the entire message starting with the Fixed IKE header through

  <section title='Useful Optional Features'>

    <t>There are some optional features of IKEv2, which might be
    useful for minimal implementations in some scenarios. Such
    features include Raw public keys authentication, and sending IKE
    SA delete notification. </t>

    <section title='IKE SA Delete Notification'>

      <t>In some scenarios the minimal implementation device creates
      IKE SA, sends one or few packets, perhaps gets some packets
      back, and then device goes back to sleep forgetting the IKE SA.
      In such scenarios it would be nice for the minimal
      implementation to send the IKE SA delete notification to tell
      the other end that the IKE SA is going away, so it can free the
      resources.</t>

      <t>Deleting the IKE SA can be done using by sending one packet
      with fixed Message ID, and with only one payload inside the
      encrypted payload. The other end will send back an empty
      response:</t>

      <t>In some scenarios the shared secret authentication is not
      safe enough, as anybody who knows the secret can impersonate
      himself of being the server. If the shared secret is printed on
      the side of the device, then anybody who gets physical access to
      the device can read it. In such environments public key
      authentication allows stronger authentication with minimal
      operational overhead. Certificate support is quite complex, and
      minimal implementations do not usually have need for them. Using
      Raw Public Keys is much simpler, and it allows similar
      scalability than certificates. The fingerprint of the Raw Public
      Key can still be distributed by for example printing it on the
      side of the device allowing similar setup than using shared
      secret.</t>

      <t>Raw Public Keys can also be used in leap of faith or baby
      duck style initial setup, where the device imprints itself to
      the first device it sees when it first time boots up. After that
      initial connection it stores the fingerprint of the Raw Public
      Key of the server to its own configuration and verifies that it
      never changes (unless reset to factory setting or similar
      command is issued).</t>

      <t>This changes the initial IKE_AUTH payloads as follows:</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Initiator                         Responder
-------------------------------------------------------------------
HDR(SPIi=xxx, SPIr=yyy, IKE_AUTH,
    Flags: Initiator, Message ID=1),
    SK {IDi, CERT, AUTH, SAi2, TSi, TSr,
        N(INITIAL_CONTACT)}  -->

                  <--  HDR(SPIi=xxx, SPIr=yyy, IKE_AUTH, Flags:
                              Response, Message ID=1),
                              SK {IDr, CERT, AUTH, SAr2, TSi, TSr}
]]></artwork></figure>

      <t>The CERT payloads contains the Raw Public Keys used the sign
      the hash of the InitiatorSignedOctects/ResponderSignedOctects
      when generating AUTH payload. Minimal implementations should use
      SHA-1 as the hash function as that is the SHOULD support
      algorithm specified in the RFC5996, so it is the most likely one
      that is supported by all devices.</t>

      <t>Note, that the More Raw Public Keys for IKEv2 (<xref
      target='I-D.ietf-ipsecme-oob-pubkey'/>) document obsoletes the
      old Raw RSA Key methods, and adds new format to allow any types
      of Raw Public Keys to IKEv2. This document only specifies how to
      use the new format.</t>

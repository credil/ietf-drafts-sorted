Abstract

   This memo provides a framework for applying Generalized Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) and the Path Computation Element
   (PCE) architecture to the control of wavelength switched optical
   networks (WSON).  In particular we provide control plane models for
   key wavelength switched optical network subsystems and processes. The
   subsystems include wavelength division multiplexed links, tunable
   laser transmitters, reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers
   (ROADM) and wavelength converters.

   Lightpath provisioning, in general, requires the routing and
   wavelength assignment (RWA) process. This process is reviewed and the
   information requirements, both static and dynamic for this process
   are presented, along with alternative implementation architectures
   that could be realized via various combinations of extended GMPLS and
   PCE protocols.

   This memo focuses on topological elements and path selection
   constraints that are common across different WSON environments as
   such it does not address optical impairments in any depth nor does it
   address potential incompatibilities between some types of optical
   signals and some types of network elements and links.

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009


1. Introduction

   This memo provides a framework for applying GMPLS and the Path
   Computation Element (PCE) architecture to the control of WSONs.  In
   particular we provide control plane models for key wavelength
   switched optical network subsystems and processes. The subsystems
   include wavelength division multiplexed links, tunable laser
   transmitters, reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (ROADM)
   and wavelength converters.

   Lightpath provisioning, in general, requires the routing and
   wavelength assignment (RWA) process. This process is reviewed and the
   information requirements, both static and dynamic for this process
   are presented, along with alternative implementation architectures
   that could be realized via various combinations of extended GMPLS and
   PCE protocols.

   This document will focus on the unique properties of links, switches
   and path selection constraints that occur in WSONs.  Different WSONs
   such as access, metro and long haul may apply different techniques
   for dealing with optical impairments hence this document will not
   address optical impairments in any depth, but instead focus on
   properties that are common across a variety of WSONs. For more on how
   the GMPLS control plane can aid in dealing with optical impairments
   see [WSON-Imp].

   For the purposes of this document we assume that all signals used in
   a WSON are compatible with all network elements and links within the
   WSON. This can arise in practice for a number of reasons including:
   (a) in some WSONs only one class of signal is used throughout the
   network, or (b) only "relatively" transparent network elements are
   utilized in the WSON. How the GMPLS control plane can deal with
   situations where this assumption is not true (i.e., where not all of
   the optical signals in the network are compatible with all network
   elements and limited to processing only certain types of WSON
   signals) is addressed in a separate draft [WSON-Compat].

   WDM: Wavelength Division Multiplexing.

   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON): WDM based optical
   networks in which switching is performed selectively based on the
   center wavelength of an optical signal.

3. Wavelength Switched Optical Networks

   WSONs come in a variety of shapes and sizes from continent spanning
   long haul networks, to metropolitan networks, to residential access
   networks. In all these cases we are concerned with those properties
   that constrain the choice of wavelengths that can be used, i.e.,
   restrict the wavelength label set, impact the path selection process,
   and limit the topological connectivity. In the following we examine
   and model some major subsystems of a WSON with an emphasis on those
   aspects that are of relevance to the control plane. In particular we
   look at WDM links, Optical Transmitters, ROADMs, and Wavelength
   Converters.

   3.1. WDM and CWDM Links

   WDM and CWDM links run over optical fibers, and optical fibers come
   in a wide range of types that tend to be optimized for various
   applications from access networks, metro, long haul, and submarine
   links to name a few. ITU-T standards exist for various types of
   fibers. For the purposes here we are concerned only with single mode
   fibers (SMF). The following SMF fiber types are typically encountered
   in optical networks:

      ITU-T Standard |  Common Name
      ------------------------------------------------------------
      G.652 [G.652]  |  Standard SMF                              |
      G.653 [G.653]  |  Dispersion shifted SMF                    |
      G.654 [G.654]  |  Cut-off shifted SMF                       |
      G.655 [G.655]  |  Non-zero dispersion shifted SMF           |
      G.656 [G.656]  |  Wideband non-zero dispersion shifted SMF  |
      ------------------------------------------------------------
   Typically WDM links operate in one or more of the approximately
   defined optical bands [G.Sup39]:

      Band     Range (nm)     Common Name    Raw Bandwidth (THz)
      O-band   1260-1360      Original       17.5
      E-band   1360-1460      Extended       15.1
      S-band   1460-1530      Short          9.4
      C-band   1530-1565      Conventional   4.4
      L-band   1565-1625      Long           7.1
      U-band   1625-1675      Ultra-long     5.5



   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 7]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009



   Not all of a band may be usable, for example in many fibers that
   support E-band there is significant attenuation due to a water
   absorption peak at 1383nm. Hence we can have a discontinuous
   acceptable wavelength range for a particular link. Also some systems
   will utilize more than one band. This is particularly true for coarse
   WDM (CWDM) systems.

   Current technology breaks up the bandwidth capacity of fibers into
   distinct channels based on either wavelength or frequency. There are
   two standards covering wavelengths and channel spacing. ITU-T
   recommendation [G.694.1] describes a DWDM grid defined in terms of
   frequency grids of 12.5GHz, 25GHz, 50GHz, 100GHz, and other multiples
   of 100GHz around a 193.1THz center frequency. At the narrowest
   channel spacing this provides less than 4800 channels across the O
   through U bands. ITU-T recommendation [G.694.2] describes a CWDM grid
   defined in terms of wavelength increments of 20nm running from 1271nm
   to 1611nm for 18 or so channels. The number of channels is
   significantly smaller than the 32 bit GMPLS label space allocated to
   lambda switching.  A label representation for these ITU-T grids is
   given in [Otani] and allows a common vocabulary to be used in
   signaling lightpaths. Further, these ITU-T grid based labels can also
   be used to describe WDM links, ROADM ports, and wavelength converters
   for the purposes path selection.

   With a tremendous existing base of fiber many WDM links are designed
   to take advantage of particular fiber characteristics or to try to
   avoid undesirable properties.  For example dispersion shifted SMF
   [G.653] was originally designed for good long distance performance in
   single channel systems, however putting WDM over this type of fiber
   requires much system engineering and a fairly limited range of
   wavelengths. Hence for our basic, impairment unaware, modeling of a
   WDM link we will need the following information:

   o  Wavelength range(s): Given a mapping between labels and the ITU-T
      grids each range could be expressed in terms of a doublet
      (lambda1, lambda2) or (freq1, freq1) where the lambdas or
      frequencies can be represented by 32 bit integers.

   o  Channel spacing: currently there are about five channel spacings
      used in DWDM systems 12.5GHz to 200GHz and one defined CWDM
      spacing.

   For a particular link this information is relatively static, i.e.,
   changes to these properties generally require hardware upgrades. Such
   information could be used locally during wavelength assignment via
   signaling, similar to label restrictions in MPLS or used by a PCE in
   solving the combined routing and wavelength assignment problem.

   3.2. Optical Transmitters

   3.2.1. Lasers

   WDM optical systems make use of laser transmitters utilizing
   different wavelengths (frequencies). Some laser transmitters were and
   are manufactured for a specific wavelength of operation, that is, the
   manufactured frequency cannot be changed. First introduced to reduce
   inventory costs, tunable optical laser transmitters are becoming
   widely deployed in some systems [Coldren04], [Buus06]. This allows
   flexibility in the wavelength used for optical transmission and aids
   in path selection.

   Fundamental modeling parameters from the control plane perspective
   optical transmitters are:

   o  Tunable: Is this transmitter tunable or fixed.

   o  Tuning range: This is the frequency or wavelength range over which
      the laser can be tuned. With the fixed mapping of labels to
      lambdas of [Otani] this can be expressed as a doublet (lambda1,
      lambda2) or (freq1, freq2) where lambda1 and lambda2 or freq1 and
      freq2 are the labels representing the lower and upper bounds in
      wavelength or frequency.

   o  Tuning time: Tuning times highly depend on the technology used.
      Thermal drift based tuning may take seconds to stabilize, whilst
      electronic tuning might provide sub-ms tuning times. Depending on
      the application this might be critical. For example, thermal drift
      might not be applicable for fast protection applications.

   o  Spectral Characteristics and stability: The spectral shape of the
      laser's emissions and its frequency stability put limits on
      various properties of the overall WDM system. One relatively easy
      to characterize constraint is the finest channel spacing on which
      the transmitter can be used.

   Note that ITU-T recommendations specify many aspects of a laser
   transmitter.. Many of these parameters, such as spectral
   characteristics and stability, are used in the design of WDM
   subsystems consisting of transmitters, WDM links and receivers
   however they do not furnish additional information that will
   influence label switched path (LSP) provisioning in a properly
   designed system.

   Also note that lasers transmitters as a component can degrade and
   fail over time. This presents the possibility of the failure of a LSP
   (lightpath) without either a node or link failure. Hence, additional


   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 9]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009


   mechanisms may be necessary to detect and differentiate this failure
   from the others, e.g., one doesn't not want to initiate mesh
   restoration if the source transmitter has failed, since the laser
   transmitter will still be failed on the alternate optical path.

   3.2.2. WSON Signal Parameters

   As pointed out in the introduction, for the purposes of this document
   we assume that all optical signals used in a WSON are compatible with
   all links, network elements, and receivers in that WSON. In [WSON-
   Compat] we discuss how the GMPLS control plane can be extended to
   deal with incompatibilities between signals and network elements.

   Key WSON signal parameters include modulation type, bit rate and
   forward error correction coding technique. Multiple modulation
   formats have been standardized [G.959.1] and many others are used
   industry and discussed in the literature [Winzer06]. When signals
   with different modulation types are used in a WSON then it can be
   important to check these signals for compatibility with network
   elements such as regenerators, OEO switches, wavelength converters
   and receivers [WSON-Compat].

   3.3. ROADMs, OXCs, Splitters, Combiners and FOADMs

   Definitions of various optical devices and their parameters can be
   found in [G.671], we only look at a subset of these and their non-
   impairment related properties.

   3.3.1. Reconfigurable Add/Drop Multiplexers and OXCs

   Reconfigurable add/drop optical multiplexers (ROADM) have matured and
   are available in different forms and technologies [Basch06]. This is
   a key technology that allows wavelength based optical switching. A
   classic degree-2 ROADM is shown in Figure 1.

         Tributary Side:   Drop (egress)  Add (ingress)

                          Figure 1 Degree-2 ROADM

   The key feature across all ROADM types is their highly asymmetric
   switching capability. In the ROADM of Figure 1, the "add" ingress
   ports can only egress on the line side egress port and not on any of
   the "drop" egress ports. The degree of a ROADM or switch is given by
   the number of line side ports (ingress and egress) and does not
   include the number of "add" or "drop" ports. Sometimes the "add"
   "drop" ports are also called tributary ports. As the degree of the
   ROADM increases beyond two it can have properties of both a switch
   (OXC) and a multiplexer and hence we must know the switched
   connectivity offered by such a network element to effectively utilize
   it. A straight forward way to do this is via a "switched
   connectivity" matrix A where Amn = 0 or 1, depending upon whether a
   wavelength on ingress port m can be connected to egress port n
   [Imajuku]. For the ROADM of Figure 1 the switched connectivity matrix
   can be expressed as

               Ingress  Egress Port
               Port     #1 #2 #3 #4 #5

   For ROADMs this matrix will be very sparse, and for OXCs the

   Note that this example is 4-degree example with one (potentially
   multi-channel) add/drop per line side port.

   Note also that the connectivity constraints for typical ROADM designs
   are "bi-directional", i.e. if ingress port X can be connected to
   egress port Y, typically ingress port Y can be connected to egress
   port X, assuming the numbering is done in such a way that ingress X
   and egress X correspond to the same line side direction or the same
   add/drop port. This makes the connectivity matrix symmetrical as
   shown below.

   line side-2 and I8/E8 are add/drop ports to/from line side-4. Note
   that diagonal elements are zero since I assume that loopback is not
   supported. If ports support loopback, diagonal elements would be one.



   Additional constraints may also apply to the various ports in a
   ROADM/OXC. In the literature of optical switches and ROADMs the
   following restrictions/terms are used:

   Colored port: An ingress or more typically an egress (drop) port
   restricted to a single channel of fixed wavelength.

   Colorless port: An ingress or more typically an egress (drop) port
   restricted to a single channel of arbitrary wavelength.

   In general a port on a ROADM could have any of the following
   wavelength restrictions:

   o  Multiple wavelengths, full range port

   o  Single wavelength, full range port

   o  Single wavelength, fixed lambda port

   o  Multiple wavelengths, reduced range port (for example wave band
      switching)

   To model these restrictions we need two pieces of information for
   each port: (a) number of wavelengths, (b) wavelength range and
   spacing.  Note that this information is relatively static. More
   complicated wavelength constraints are modeled in [WSON-Info].

   3.3.2. Splitters

   An optical splitter consists of a single ingress port and two or more
   egress ports. The ingress optical signaled is essentially copied
   (with loss) to all egress ports.

   Using the modeling notions of section 3.3.1. the ingress and egress
   ports of a splitter would have the same wavelength restrictions. In
   addition we can describe a splitter by a connectivity matrix Amn as
   follows:







   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 13]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009


               Ingress  Egress Port
               Port     #1 #2 #3 ...   #N
                        -----------------
         A =   #1       1  1  1  ...   1

   The difference from a simple ROADM is that this is not a switched
   (potential) connectivity matrix but the fixed connectivity matrix of
   the device.

   3.3.3. Combiners

   A optical combiner is somewhat the dual of a splitter in that it has
   a single multi-wavelength egress port and multiple ingress ports.
   The contents of all the ingress ports are copied and combined to the
   single egress port.  The various ports may have different wavelength
   restrictions. It is generally the responsibility of those using the
   combiner to assure that wavelength collision does not occur on the
   egress port. The fixed connectivity matrix Amn for a combiner would
   look like:

               Ingress  Egress Port
               Port     #1
                        ---
               #1:      1
               #2       1
         A =   #3       1
               ...      1
               #N       1



   3.3.4. Fixed Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers

   A fixed optical add/drop multiplexer can alter the course of an
   ingress wavelength in a preset way. In particular a given wavelength
   (or waveband) from a line side ingress port would be dropped to a
   fixed "tributary" egress port. Depending on the device's construction
   that same wavelength may or may not be "continued" to the line side
   egress port ("drop and continue" operation).  Further there may exist
   tributary ingress ports ("add" ports) whose signals are combined with
   each other and "continued" line side signals.

   In general to represent the routing properties of an FOADM we need a
   fixed connectivity matrix Amn as previously discussed and we need the
   precise wavelength restrictions for all ingress and egress ports.
   From the wavelength restrictions on the tributary egress ports (drop
   ports) we can see what wavelengths have been dropped. From the
   wavelength restrictions on the tributary ingress (add) ports we can


   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 14]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009


   see which wavelengths have been added to the line side egress port.
   Finally from the added wavelength information and the line side
   egress wavelength restrictions we can infer which wavelengths have
   been continued.

   To summarize, the modeling methodology introduced in section 3.3.1.
   consisting of a connectivity matrix and port wavelength restrictions
   can be used to describe a large set of fixed optical devices such as
   combiners, splitters and FOADMs. Hybrid devices consisting of both
   switched and fixed parts are modeled in [WSON-Info].

   3.4. Wavelength Converters

   Wavelength converters take an ingress optical signal at one
   wavelength and emit an equivalent content optical signal at another
   wavelength on egress. There are currently two approaches to building
   wavelength converters. One approach is based on optical to electrical
   to optical (OEO) conversion with tunable lasers on egress. This
   approach can be dependent upon the signal rate and format, i.e., this
   is basically an electrical regenerator combined with a tunable laser.
   The other approach performs the wavelength conversion, optically via
   non-linear optical effects, similar in spirit to the familiar
   frequency mixing used in radio frequency systems, but significantly
   harder to implement.  Such processes/effects may place limits on the
   range of achievable conversion. These may depend on the wavelength of
   the input signal and the properties of the converter as opposed to
   only the properties of the converter in the OEO case. Different WSON
   system designs may choose to utilize this component to varying
   degrees or not at all.

   Current or envisioned contexts for wavelength converters are:

  1. Wavelength conversion associated with OEO switches and tunable
     laser transmitters. In this case there are plenty of converters to
     go around since we can think of each tunable output laser
     transmitter on an OEO switch as a potential wavelength converter.

  2. Wavelength conversion associated with ROADMs/OXCs. In this case we
     may have a limited pool of wavelength converters available.
     Conversion could be either all optical or via an OEO method.

  3. Wavelength conversion associated with fixed devices such as FOADMs.
     In this case we may have a limited amount of conversion. Also in
     this case the conversion may be used as part of light path routing.

   Based on the above contexts a modeling approach for wavelength
   converters could be as follows:



   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 15]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009


   1. Wavelength converters can always be modeled as associated with
      network elements. This includes fixed wavelength routing elements.

   2. A network element may have full wavelength conversion capability,
      i.e., any ingress port and wavelength, or a limited number of
      wavelengths and ports. On a box with a limited number of
      converters there also may exist restrictions on which ports can
      reach the converters. Hence regardless of where the converters
      actually are we can associate them with ingress ports.

   3. Wavelength converters have range restrictions that are either
      independent or dependent upon the ingress wavelength.

   In WSONs where wavelength converters are sparse we may actually see a
   light path appear to loop or "backtrack" upon itself in order to
   reach a wavelength converter prior to continuing on to its
   destination. The lambda used on the "detour" out to the wavelength
   converter would be different from that coming back from the "detour"
   to the wavelength converter.

   A model for an individual O-E-O wavelength converter would consist
   of:

   o  Input lambda or frequency range

   o  Output lambda or frequency range



   3.4.1. Wavelength Converter Pool Modeling

   A WSON node may include multiple wavelength converters. These are
   usually arranged into some type of pool to promote resource sharing.
   There are a number of different approaches used in the design of
   switches with converter pools. However, from the point of view of
   path computation we need to know the following:

   1. The nodes that support wavelength conversion.

   2. The accessibility and availability of a wavelength converter to
      convert from a given ingress wavelength on a particular ingress
      port to a desired egress wavelength on a particular egress port.

   3. Limitations on the types of signals that can be converted and the
      conversions that can be performed.

   To model point 2 above we can use a similar technique as used to
   model ROADMs and optical switches, i.e., matrices to indicate


   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 16]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009


   possible connectivity along with wavelength constraints for
   links/ports. Since wavelength converters are considered a scarce
   resource we will also want our model to include as a minimum the
   usage state of individual wavelength converters in the pool.

   We utilize a three stage model as shown schematically in Figure 3. In
   this model we assume N ingress ports (fibers), P wavelength
   converters, and M egress ports (fibers). Since not all ingress ports
   can necessarily reach the converter pool, the model starts with a
   wavelength pool ingress matrix WI(i,p) = {0,1} whether ingress port i
   can reach potentially reach wavelength converter p.

   Since not all wavelength can necessarily reach all the converters or
   the converters may have limited input wavelength range we have a set
   of ingress port constraints for each wavelength converter. Currently
   we assume that a wavelength converter can only take a single
   wavelength on input. We can model each wavelength converter ingress
   port constraint via a wavelength set mechanism.

   Next we have a state vector WC(j) = {0,1} dependent upon whether
   wavelength converter j in the pool is in use. This is the only state
   kept in the converter pool model. This state is not necessary for
   modeling "fixed" transponder system, i.e., systems where there is no
   sharing.  In addition, this state information may be encoded in a
   much more compact form depending on the overall connectivity
   structure [WC-Pool].

   After that, we have a set of wavelength converter egress wavelength
   constraints. These constraints indicate what wavelengths a particular
   wavelength converter can generate or are restricted to generating due
   to internal switch structure.

   Finally, we have a wavelength pool egress matrix WE(p,k) = {0,1}
   depending on whether the output from wavelength converter p can reach
   egress port k. Examples of this method being used to model wavelength
   converter pools for several switch architectures from the literature
   are given in reference [WC-Pool].

4. Routing and Wavelength Assignment and the Control Plane

   In wavelength switched optical networks consisting of tunable lasers
   and wavelength selective switches with wavelength converters on every
   interface, path selection is similar to the MPLS and TDM circuit
   switched cases in that the labels, in this case wavelengths
   (lambdas), have only local significance. That is, a wavelength-
   convertible network with full wavelength-conversion capability at
   each node is equivalent to a circuit-switched TDM network with full
   time slot interchange capability; thus, the routing problem needs to
   be addressed only at the level of the traffic engineered (TE) link



   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 20]

   choice, and wavelength assignment can be resolved locally by the
   switches on a hop-by-hop basis.

   However, in the limiting case of an optical network with no
   wavelength converters, a light path (optical signal) needs a route
   from source to destination and must pick a single wavelength that can
   be used along that path without "colliding" with the wavelength used
   by any other light path that may share an optical fiber. This is
   sometimes referred to as a "wavelength continuity constraint". To
   ease up on this constraint while keeping network costs in check a
   limited number of wavelength converters may be introduced at key
   points in the network [Chu03].

   In the general case of limited or no wavelength converters this
   computation is known as the Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA)
   problem [HZang00]. The "hardness" of this problem is well documented.
   There, however, exist a number of reasonable approximate methods for
   its solution [HZang00].

   The inputs to the basic RWA problem are the requested light paths
   source and destination, the network's topology, the locations and
   capabilities of any wavelength converters, and the wavelengths
   available on each optical link. The output from an algorithm solving
   the RWA problem is an explicit route through ROADMs, a wavelength for
   the optical transmitter, and a set of locations (generally associated
   with ROADMs or switches) where wavelength conversion is to occur and
   the new wavelength to be used on each component link after that point
   in the route.

   It is to be noted that choice of specific RWA algorithm is out of the
   scope for this document. However there are a number of different
   approaches to dealing with the RWA algorithm that can affect the
   division of effort between signaling, routing and PCE.



   4.1. Architectural Approaches to RWA

   Two general computational approaches are taken to solving the RWA
   problem. Some algorithms utilize a two step procedure of path
   selection followed by wavelength assignment, and others solve the
   problem in a combined fashion.

   In the following, three different ways of performing RWA in
   conjunction with the control plane are considered. The choice of one
   of these architectural approaches over another generally impacts the
   demands placed on the various control plane protocols.



   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 21]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009


   4.1.1. Combined RWA (R&WA)

   In this case, a unique entity is in charge of performing routing and
   wavelength assignment. This approach relies on a sufficient knowledge
   of network topology, of available network resources and of network
   nodes capabilities. This solution is compatible with most known RWA
   algorithms, and in particular those concerned with network
   optimization. On the other hand, this solution requires up-to-date
   and detailed network information.

   Such a computational entity could reside in two different logical
   places:

   o  In a separate Path Computation Element (PCE) which hence owns the
      complete and updated knowledge of network state and provides path
      computation services to node.

   o  In the Ingress node, in that case all nodes have the R&WA
      functionality; the knowledge of the network state is obtained by a
      periodic flooding of information provided by the other nodes.

   4.1.2. Separated R and WA (R+WA)

   In this case a first entity performs routing, while a second performs
   wavelength assignment. The first entity furnishes one or more paths
   to the second entity that will perform wavelength assignment and
   possibly final path selection.

   As the entities computing the path and the wavelength assignment are
   separated, this constrains the class of RWA algorithms that may be
   implemented. Although it may seem that algorithms optimizing a joint
   usage of the physical and spectral paths are excluded from this
   solution, many practical optimization algorithms only consider a
   limited set of possible paths, e.g., as computed via a k-shortest
   path algorithm [Ozdaglar03]. Hence although there is no guarantee
   that the selected final route and wavelength offers the optimal
   solution, by allowing multiple routes to pass to the wavelength
   selection process reasonable optimization can be performed.

   The entity performing the routing assignment needs the topology
   information of the network, whereas the entity performing the
   wavelength assignment needs information on the network's available
   resources and on network node capabilities.







   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 22]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009


   4.1.3. Routing and Distributed WA (R+DWA)

   In this case a first entity performs routing, while wavelength
   assignment is performed on a hop-by-hop manner along the previously
   computed route. This mechanism relies on updating of a list of
   potential wavelengths used to ensure conformance with the wavelength
   continuity constraint.

   As currently specified, the GMPLS protocol suite signaling protocol
   can accommodate such an approach. Per [RFC3471], the Label Set
   selection works according to an AND scheme. Each hop restricts the
   Label Set sent to the next hop from the one received from the
   previous hop by performing an AND operation between the wavelength
   referred by the labels the message includes with the one available on
   the ongoing interface. The constraint to perform this AND operation
   is up to the node local policy (even if one expects a consistent
   policy configuration throughout a given transparency domain). When
   wavelength conversion is performed at an intermediate node, a new
   Label Set is generated. The egress nodes selects one label in the
   Label Set received at the node, which is also up to the node local
   policy.

   Depending on these policies a spectral assignment may not be found or
   one consuming too many conversion resources relative to what a
   dedicated wavelength assignment policy would have achieved. Hence,
   this approach may generate higher blocking probabilities in a heavily
   loaded network.

   On the one hand, this solution may be empowered with some signaling
   extensions to ease its functioning and possibly enhance its
   performances relatively to blocking. Note that this approach requires
   less information dissemination than the others.

   The first entity may be a PCE or the ingress node of the LSP. This
   solution is applicable inside networks where resource optimization is
   not as critical.

   4.2. Conveying information needed by RWA

   The previous sections have characterized WSONs and lightpath
   requests. In particular, high level models of the information used by
   the RWA process were presented. We can view this information as
   either static, changing with hardware changes (including possibly
   failures), or dynamic, those that can change with subsequent
   lightpath provisioning. The timeliness in which an entity involved in
   the RWA process is notified of such changes is fairly situational.
   For example, for network restoration purposes, learning of a hardware
   failure or of new hardware coming online to provide restoration


   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 23]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009


   capability can be critical.
   Currently there are various methods for communicating RWA relevant
   information, these include, but are not limited to:

   o  Existing control plane protocols such as GMPLS routing and
      signaling. Note that routing protocols can be used to convey both
      static and dynamic information. Static information currently
      conveyed includes items like router options and such.

   o  Management protocols such as NetConf, SNMPv3, CLI, CORBA, or
      others.

   o  Directory services and accompanying protocols. These are good for
      the dissemination of relatively static information. Not intended
      for dynamic information.

   o  Other techniques for dynamic information: messaging straight from
      NEs to PCE to avoid flooding. This would be useful if the number
      of PCEs is significantly less than number of WSON NEs. Or other
      ways to limit flooding to "interested" NEs.

   Mechanisms to improve scaling of dynamic information:

   o  Tailor message content to WSON. For example the use of wavelength
      ranges, or wavelength occupation bit maps.

   Utilize incremental updates if feasible.

   4.3. Lightpath Temporal Characteristics

   The temporal characteristics of a light path connection can affect
   the choice of solution to the RWA process. For our purposes here we
   look at the timeliness of connection establishment/teardown, and the
   duration of the connection.

   Connection Establishment/Teardown Timeliness can be thought of in
   approximately three time frames:

  1. Time Critical:  For example those lightpath establishments used for
     restoration of service or other high priority real time service
     requests.

  2. Soft time bounds: This is a more typical new connection request.
     While expected to be responsive, there should be more time to take
     into account network optimization.

  3. Scheduled or Advanced reservations. Here lightpath connections are
     requested significantly ahead of their intended "in service" time.


   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 24]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009


     There is the potential for significant network optimization if
     multiple lightpaths can be computed concurrently to achieve network
     optimization objectives.

  Lightpath connection duration has typically been thought of as
     approximately three time frames:

  1. Dynamic: those lightpaths with relatively short duration (holding
     times).

  2. Pseudo-static: lightpaths with moderately long durations.

  3. Static: lightpaths with long durations.

   Different types of RWA algorithms have been developed for dealing
   with dynamic versus pseudo-static conditions.  These can address
   service provider's needs for: (a) network optimization, (b)
   restoration, and (c) highly dynamic lightpath provisioning.

   Hence we can model timescale related lightpath requirements via the
   following notions:

   o  Batch or Sequential light path connection requests

   o  Timeliness of Connection establishment

   o  Duration of lightpath connection

5. Modeling Examples and Control Plane Use Cases

   This section provides examples of the fixed and switch optical node
   and wavelength constraint models of section 3. and WSON control plane
   use cases related to path computation, establishment, rerouting, and
   optimization.

   5.1. Network Modeling for GMPLS/PCE Control

   Consider a network containing three routers (R1 through R3), eight
   WSON nodes (N1 through N8) and 18 links (L1 through L18) and one OEO
   converter (O1) in a topology shown below.

   5.1.1. Describing the WSON nodes

   The eight WSON nodes in this example have the following properties:

   o  Nodes N1, N2, N3 have fixed OADMs (FOADMs) installed and can
      therefore only access a static and pre-defined set of wavelengths

   o  All other nodes contain ROADMs and can therefore access all
      wavelengths.

   o  Nodes N4, N5, N7 and N8 are multi-degree nodes, allowing any
      wavelength to be optically switched between any of the links. Note
      however, that this does not automatically apply to wavelengths
      that are being added or dropped at the particular node.

   o  Node N4 is an exception to that: This node can switch any
      wavelength from its add/drop ports to any of its outgoing links
      (L5, L7 and L12 in this case)

   o  The links from the routers are always only able to carry one
      wavelength with the exception of links L8 and L9 which are capable
      to add/drop any wavelength.

   o  Node N7 contains an OEO transponder (O1) connected to the node via
      links L13 and L14. That transponder operates in 3R mode and does
      not change the wavelength of the signal. Assume that it can
      regenerate any of the client signals, however only for a specific
      wavelength.

   Given the above restrictions, the node information for the eight
   nodes can be expressed as follows: (where ID == identifier, SCM ==
   switched connectivity matrix, and FCM == fixed connectivity matrix).

   5.1.2. Describing the links

   For the following discussion some simplifying assumptions are made:


   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 28]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009


   o   It is assumed that the WSON node support a total of four
      wavelengths designated WL1 through WL4.

   o   It is assumed that the impairment feasibility of a path or path
      segment is independent from the wavelength chosen.

   For the discussion of the RWA operation to build LSPs between two
   routers, the wavelength constraints on the links between the routers
   and the WSON nodes as well as the connectivity matrix of these links
   needs to be specified:

   +Link+WLs supported    +Possible egress links+
   | L1 | WL1             | L3                  |
   +----+-----------------+---------------------+

   | L18| WL1             | L15                 |
   +----+-----------------+---------------------+


   Note that the possible egress links for the links connecting to the
   routers is inferred from the Switched Connectivity Matrix and the
   Fixed Connectivity Matrix of the Nodes N1 through N8 and is show here
   for convenience, i.e., this information does not need to be repeated.

   5.2. RWA Path Computation and Establishment

   The calculation of optical impairment feasible routes is outside the
   scope of this framework document. In general impairment feasible
   routes serve as an input to the RWA algorithm.

   For the example use case shown here, assume the following feasible
   routes:

   |  R2      | R3       | L8 L7 L11 L16 L17    |
   |  R2      | R3       | L9 L12 L15 L18       |
   |  R2      | R3       | L9 L7 L11 L16 L17    |

   Given a request to establish a LSP between R1 and R2 the RWA
   algorithm finds the following possible solutions:

   +WL  + Path          +
   | WL1| L1 L3 L5 L8   |
   | WL1| L1 L3 L5 L9   |
   | WL2| L2 L4 L6 L7 L8|
   | WL2| L2 L4 L6 L7 L9|
   | WL2| L2 L4 L6 L10  |


   Assume now that the RWA chooses WL1 and the Path L1 L3 L5 L8 for the
   requested LSP.

   Next, another LSP is signaled from R1 to R2. Given the established
   LSP using WL1, the following table shows the available paths:

   +WL  + Path          +
   | WL2| L2 L4 L6 L7 L9|
   | WL2| L2 L4 L6 L10  |

   Assume now that the RWA chooses WL2 and the path L2 L4 L6 L7 L9 for
   the establishment of the new LSP.

   Faced with another LSP request -this time from R2 to R3 - can not be
   fulfilled since the only four possible paths (starting at L8 and L9)
   are already in use.

   5.3. Resource Optimization

   The preceding example gives rise to another use case: The
   optimization of network resources. Optimization can be achieved on a
   number of layers (e.g. through electrical or optical multiplexing of


   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 30]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009


   client signals) or by re-optimizing the solutions found by the RWA
   algorithm.

   Given the above example again, assume that the RWA algorithm should
   find a path between R2 and R3. The only possible path to reach R3
   from R2 needs to use L9. L9 however is blocked by one of the LSPs
   from R1.

   5.4. Support for Rerouting

   It is also envisioned that the extensions to GMPLS and PCE support
   rerouting of wavelengths in case of failures.

   Assume for this discussion that the only two LSPs in use in the
   system are:

   LSP1: WL1 L1 L3 L5 L8

   LSP2: WL2 L2 L4 L6 L7 L9

   Assume furthermore that the link L5 fails. The RWA can now find the
   following alternate path and and establish that path:

   R1 -> N7 -> R2

   Level 3 regeneration will take place at N7, so that the complete path
   looks like this:

   R1 -> L2 L4 L6 L11 L13 -> O1 -> L14 L16 L15 L12 L9 -> R2



6. GMPLS & PCE Implications

   The presence and amount of wavelength conversion available at a
   wavelength switching interface has an impact on the information that
   needs to be transferred by the control plane (GMPLS) and the PCE
   architecture. Current GMPLS and PCE standards can address the full
   wavelength conversion case so the following will only address the
   limited and no wavelength conversion cases.

   6.1. Implications for GMPLS signaling

   Basic support for WSON signaling already exists in GMPLS with the
   lambda (value 9) LSP encoding type [RFC3471], or for G.709 compatible
   optical channels, the LSP encoding type (value = 13) "G.709 Optical
   Channel" from [RFC4328]. However a number of practical issues arise



   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 31]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009


   in the identification of wavelengths and signals, and distributed
   wavelength assignment processes which are discussed below.

   6.1.1. Identifying Wavelengths and Signals

   As previously stated a global fixed mapping between wavelengths and
   labels simplifies the characterization of WDM links and WSON devices.
   Furthermore such a mapping as described in [Otani] eases
   communication between PCE and WSON PCCs.

   6.1.2. Combined RWA/Separate Routing WA support

   In either the combined RWA or separate routing WA cases, the node
   initiating the signaling will have a route from the source to
   destination along with the wavelengths (generalized labels) to be
   used along portions of the path. Current GMPLS signaling supports an
   explicit route object (ERO) and within an ERO an ERO Label subobject
   can be use to indicate the wavelength to be used at a particular
   node. In case the local label map approach is used the label sub-
   object entry in the ERO has to be translated appropriately.

   6.1.3. Distributed Wavelength Assignment: Unidirectional, No
      Converters

   GMPLS signaling for a uni-directional lightpath LSP allows for the
   use of a label set object in the RSVP-TE path message. The processing
   of the label set object to take the intersection of available lambdas
   along a path can be performed resulting in the set of available
   lambda being known to the destination that can then use a wavelength
   selection algorithm to choose a lambda. For example, the following is
   a non-exhaustive subset of wavelength assignment (WA) approaches
   discussed in [HZang00]:

   1. Random: Looks at all available wavelengths for the light path then
      chooses from those available at random.

   2. First Fit: Wavelengths are ordered, first available (on all links)
      is chosen.

   3. Most Used: Out of the wavelengths available on the path attempts
      to select most use wavelength in network.

   4. Least Loaded: For multi-fiber networks. Chooses the wavelength j
      that maximizes minimum of the difference between the number of
      fibers on link l and the number of fibers on link l with
      wavelength j occupied.




   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 32]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009


   As can be seen from the above short list, wavelength assignment
   methods have differing information or processing requirements. The
   information requirements of these methods are as follows:

  1. Random: nothing more than the available wavelength set.

  2. First Fit: nothing more than the available wavelength set.

  3. Most Used: the available wavelength set and information on global
     wavelength use in the network.

  4. Least Loaded: the available wavelength set and information
     concerning the wavelength dependent loading for each link (this
     applies to multi-fiber links). This could be obtained via global
     information or via supplemental information passed via the
     signaling protocol.

   In case (3) above the global information needed by the wavelength
   assignment could be derived from suitably enhanced GMPLS routing.
   Note however this information need not be accurate enough for
   combined RWA computation. GMPLS signaling does not provide a way to
   indicate that a particular wavelength assignment algorithm should be
   used.

   6.1.4. Distributed Wavelength Assignment: Unidirectional, Limited
      Converters

   The previous outlined the case with no wavelength converters. In the
   case of wavelength converters, nodes with wavelength converters would
   need to make the decision as to whether to perform conversion. One
   indicator for this would be that the set of available wavelengths
   which is obtained via the intersection of the incoming label set and
   the egress links available wavelengths is either null or deemed too
   small to permit successful completion.

   At this point the node would need to remember that it will apply
   wavelength conversion and will be responsible for assigning the
   wavelength on the previous lambda-contiguous segment when the RSVP-TE
   RESV message passes by. The node will pass on an enlarged label set
   reflecting only the limitations of the wavelength converter and the
   egress link. The record route option in RVSP-TE signaling can be used
   to show where wavelength conversion has taken place.

   6.1.5. Distributed Wavelength Assignment: Bidirectional, No
      Converters

   There are potential issues in the case of a bi-directional lightpath
   which requires the use of the same lambda in both directions. We can


   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 33]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009


   try to use the above procedure to determine the available
   bidirectional lambda set if we use the interpretation that the
   available label set is available in both directions. However, a
   problem, arises in that bidirectional LSPs setup, according to
   [RFC3471] section 4.1, is indicated by the presence of an upstream
   label in the path message.

   However, until the intersection of the available label sets is
   obtained, e.g., at the destination node and the wavelength assignment
   algorithm has been run the upstream label information will not be
   available. Hence currently distributed wavelength assignment with
   bidirectional lightpaths is not supported.


   6.2. Implications for GMPLS Routing

   GMPLS routing [RFC4202] currently defines an interface capability
   descriptor for "lambda switch capable" (LSC) which we can use to
   describe the interfaces on a ROADM or other type of wavelength
   selective switch. In addition to the topology information typically
   conveyed via an IGP, we would need to convey the following subsystem
   properties to minimally characterize a WSON:

  1. WDM Link properties (allowed wavelengths).

  2. Laser Transmitters (wavelength range).

  3. ROADM/FOADM properties (connectivity matrix, port wavelength
     restrictions).

  4. Wavelength Converter properties (per network element, may change if
     a common limited shared pool is used).

   This information is modeled in detail in [WSON-Info] and a compact
   encoding is given in [WSON-Encode].

   6.2.1. Wavelength-Specific Availability Information

   For wavelength assignment we need to know which specific wavelengths
   are available and which are occupied if we are going to run a
   combined RWA process or separate WA process as discussed in sections
   4.1.1. 4.1.2.  This is currently not possible with GMPLS routing
   extensions.

   In the routing extensions for GMPLS [RFC4202], requirements for
   layer-specific TE attributes are discussed. The RWA problem for
   optical networks without wavelength converters imposes an additional
   requirement for the lambda (or optical channel) layer: that of


   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 34]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009


   knowing which specific wavelengths are in use. Note that current
   dense WDM (DWDM) systems range from 16 channels to 128 channels with
   advanced laboratory systems with as many as 300 channels. Given these
   channel limitations and if we take the approach of a global
   wavelength to label mapping or furnishing the local mappings to the
   PCEs then representing the use of wavelengths via a simple bit-map is
   feasible [WSON-Encode].

   6.2.2. WSON Routing Information Summary

   The following table summarizes the WSON information that could be
   conveyed via GMPLS routing and attempts to classify that information
   as to its static or dynamic nature and whether that information would
   tend to be associated with either a link or a node.



      Information                         Static/Dynamic       Node/Link
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      Connectivity matrix                 Static               Node
      Per port wavelength restrictions    Static               Node(1)
      WDM link (fiber) lambda ranges      Static               Link
      WDM link channel spacing            Static               Link
      Laser Transmitter range             Static               Link(2)
      Wavelength conversion capabilities  Static(3)            Node
      Maximum bandwidth per Wavelength    Static               Link
      Wavelength Availability             Dynamic(4)           Link

   Notes:

   1. These are the per port wavelength restrictions of an optical
      device such as a ROADM and are independent of any optical
      constraints imposed by a fiber link.

   2. This could also be viewed as a node capability.

   3. This could be dynamic in the case of a limited pool of converters
      where the number available can change with connection
      establishment. Note we may want to include regeneration
      capabilities here since OEO converters are also regenerators.

   4. Not necessarily needed in the case of distributed wavelength
      assignment via signaling.



   While the full complement of the information from the previous table
   is needed in the Combined RWA and the separate Routing and WA


   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 35]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009


   architectures, in the case of Routing + distribute WA via signaling
   we only need the following information:

      Information                         Static/Dynamic       Node/Link
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      Connectivity matrix                 Static               Node
      Wavelength conversion capabilities  Static(3)            Node


   Information models and compact encodings for this information is
   provided in [WSON-Info] and [WSON-Encode].



   6.3. Optical Path Computation and Implications for PCE

   As previously noted the RWA problem can be computationally intensive
   [HZang00]. Such computationally intensive path computations and
   optimizations were part of the impetus for the PCE (path computation
   element) architecture.

   As the PCEP defines the procedures necessary to support both
   sequential [RFC5440] and global concurrent path computations
   [RFC5557], PCE is well positioned to support WSON-enabled RWA
   computation with some protocol enhancement.

   Implications for PCE generally fall into two main categories: (a)
   lightpath constraints and characteristics, (b) computation
   architectures.

   6.3.1. Lightpath Constraints and Characteristics

   For the varying degrees of optimization that may be encountered in a
   network the following models of bulk and sequential lightpath
   requests are encountered:

   o  Batch optimization, multiple lightpaths requested at one time.

   o  Lightpath(s) and backup lightpath(s) requested at one time.

   o  Single lightpath requested at a time.

   PCEP and PCE-GCO can be readily enhanced to support all of the
   potential models of RWA computation.

   Lightpath constraints include:

   o  Bidirectional Assignment of wavelengths


   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 36]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009


   o  Possible simultaneous assignment of wavelength to primary and
      backup paths.

   o  Tuning range constraint on optical transmitter.

   Lightpath characteristics can include:

   o  Duration information (how long this connection may last)

   o  Timeliness/Urgency information (how quickly is this connection
      needed)

   6.3.2. Discovery of RWA Capable PCEs

   The algorithms and network information needed for solving the RWA are
   somewhat specialized and computationally intensive hence not all PCEs
   within a domain would necessarily need or want this capability.
   Hence, it would be useful via the mechanisms being established for
   PCE discovery [RFC5088] to indicate that a PCE has the ability to
   deal with the RWA problem. Reference [RFC5088] indicates that a sub-
   TLV could be allocated for this purpose.

   Recent progress on objective functions in PCE [RFC5541] would allow
   the operators to flexibly request differing objective functions per
   their need and applications. For instance, this would allow the
   operator to choose an objective function that minimizes the total
   network cost associated with setting up a set of paths concurrently.
   This would also allow operators to choose an objective function that
   results in a most evenly distributed link utilization.

   This implies that PCEP would easily accommodate wavelength selection
   algorithm in its objective function to be able to optimize the path
   computation from the perspective of wavelength assignment if chosen
   by the operators.

   6.4. Summary of Impacts by RWA Architecture

   The following table summarizes for each RWA strategy the list of
   mandatory ("M") and optional ("O") control plane features according
   to GMPLS architectural blocks:

   o  Information required by the path computation entity,

   o  LSP request parameters used in either PCC to PCE situations or in
      signaling,

   o  RSVP-TE LSP signaling parameters used in LSP establishment.



   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 37]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009


   The table shows which enhancements are common to all architectures
   (R&WA, R+WA, R+DWA), which apply only to R&WA and R+WA (R+&WA), and
   which apply only to R+DWA. Note that this summary serves for the
   purpose of a generic reference.

7. Security Considerations

   This document has no requirement for a change to the security models
   within GMPLS and associated protocols. That is the OSPF-TE, RSVP-TE,
   and PCEP security models could be operated unchanged.

   However satisfying the requirements for RWA using the existing
   protocols may significantly affect the loading of those protocols.
   This makes the operation of the network more vulnerable to denial of


   Bernstein and Lee Expires April 9, 2010[Page 38]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks      October 2009


   service attacks. Therefore additional care maybe required to ensure
   that the protocols are secure in the WSON environment.

   Furthermore the additional information distributed in order to
   address the RWA problem represents a disclosure of network
   capabilities that an operator may wish to keep private. Consideration
   should be given to securing this information.

8. IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request for IANA actions.

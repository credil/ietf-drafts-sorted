    Internet-Draft       Ethernet Traffic Parameters    January 20, 2010 
        

    Abstract 

        
       This document describes the support of Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) 
       Ethernet Traffic Parameters as described in MEF10.1 when using 
       Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Resource 
       ReSerVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling. 
        
    1. Introduction 
        
       Per [RFC3471], Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) 
       allows the inclusion of technology specific parameters in 
       signaling. Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC specific objects 
       are introduced in this document that supports Metro Ethernet 
       Forum (MEF) Ethernet traffic parameters as specified in [MEF10.1] 
       and ITU-T Ethernet Service Switching as discussed in [GMPLS-
       ESVCS]. For example: 
        
       o For Ethernet Private Line (EPL) services [MEF6], these traffic    
         parameters are applicable to each Ethernet Virtual Connection  
         (EVC) crossing a given port. 
        
       o For Ethernet Virtual Private Line (EVPL) services [MEF6], these    
         traffic parameters are applicable per Ethernet Virtual  
         Connection (EVC) with single or multiple Class of Service  
         (CoS), independent of its associated (set of) Virtual LAN ID  
         (VID). 
        
         Association between EVC and VIDs is detailed in [MEF10.1]. The    
         format and encoding of the (set of) VIDs is documented in a  
         companion document [GMPLS-ESVCS].  
        
       This does not preclude broader usage of the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC 
       and FLOWSPEC specific objects specified this document. For 
       instance, they may also be used for signaling Ethernet Label 
       Switched Paths (LSP): in the Generalized Label Request (see 
       [RFC3471]), the Switching Type field is set to Layer 2 Switching 
       Capability (L2SC) and the LSP Encoding Type field to Ethernet.  
        
    2. Conventions used in this document 
        
       The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
       NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
       "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
       RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

       Moreover, the reader is assumed to be familiar with the 
       terminology [MEF10.1] as well as [RFC3471] and [RFC3473]. 
        
    3. Overview 
        
       In GMPLS RSVP-TE [RFC3473] the SENDER_TSPEC object is used on a 
       Path message to indicate the bandwidth that is requested for the 
       LSP being established, and the FLOWSPEC object is used on a Resv 
       message to indicate the bandwidth actually reserved for the LSP. 
       The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC/FLOWSPEC object includes the Ethernet 
       link type (switching granularity) of the requested LSP and the 
       MTU value for the LSP. Other information about the requested 
       bandwidth characteristics of the LSP are carried in the Bandwidth 
       Profile as a TLV within the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC/FLOWSPEC 
       object. 
        
       The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC/FLOWSPEC object includes the Ethernet 
       link type (switching granularity) of the requested LSP and the 
       MTU value for the LSP. 
        
       The Bandwidth Profile defines the set of traffic parameters 
       applicable to a sequence of Service Frames, referred to as 
       bandwidth profile parameters (as specified in [MEF10.1]): 
        
       o Committed Rate: indicates the rate at which traffic commits to 
         be sent to the Ethernet LSP. The Committed Rate is described in  
         terms of the CIR (Committed Information Rate) and CBS 
         (Committed Burst Size) traffic parameters. 
        
         o CIR is defined as the average rate (in bytes per unit of 
           time) up to which the network is committed to transfer frames 
           and meets its performance objectives. 
        
         o CBS defines a limit on the maximum number of information 
           units (e.g., bytes) available for a burst of frames sent at 
           the interface speed to remain CIR-conformant. 
        
       o Excess Rate: indicates the extent by which the traffic sent on  
         an Ethernet LSP exceeds the committed rate. The Excess Rate is 
         described in terms of the EIR (Excess Information Rate) and EBS  
         (Excess Burst Size) traffic parameters. 
        
         o EIR is defined as the average rate (in bytes per unit of    
           time), in excess of the CIR, up to which the network may  
           transfer frames  without any performance objectives. 
        
         o EBS defines a limit on the maximum number of information unit

           (e.g., bytes) available for a burst of frames sent at the  
           interface speed to remain EIR-conformant. 
        
       o Color mode (CM): indicates whether the "color-aware" or "color-    
         blind" property is employed by the bandwidth profile. 
        
       o Coupling flag (CF): allows the choice between two modes of  
         operation of the rate enforcement algorithm. 
        
    4. Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC Object 
     
       The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object (Class-Num = 12, Class-Type =

             Indicates the length in bytes of the whole TLV including  
             the Type and Length fields. A value field whose length is  
             not a multiple of four MUST be zero-padded (with trailing  
             zeros) so that the TLV is four-octet aligned. 
        
    4.1. Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLV 
        
       The Type 2 TLV specifies the Ethernet Bandwidth Profile (BW 
       profile). It defines an upper bound on the volume of the expected 
       service frames belonging to a particular Ethernet service 
       instance. The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object MAY include more than 
       one Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLV. 
        
       The Type 2 TLV has the following format:

       Profile: 8 bits (this field is to be registered by IANA) 
        
          This field is defined as a bit vector of binary flags. The  
          following flags are defined: 
              
             Flag 1 (bit 0): coupling flag (CF) 
             Flag 2 (bit 1): color mode (CM) 
        
          Where bit 0 is the low order bit. Other flags are reserved,  
          they SHOULD be set to zero when sent, and SHOULD be ignored  
          when received. 
              
          A flag is set to value 1 to indicate that the corresponding    
          metering profile is requested.

    Internet-Draft       Ethernet Traffic Parameters    January 20, 2010 
        

        
          The Flag 1 (CF) allows the choice between two modes of  
          operation of the rate enforcement algorithm. 
        
          The Flag 2 (CM) indicates whether the color-aware or color- 
          blind property is employed by the bandwidth profile. When Flag  
          2 is set to value 0 (1), the bandwidth profile algorithm is  
          said to be in color blind (color aware) mode. 
     
       Index: 8 bits 
     
          The index field is used to reference bandwidth allocated for a 
          given traffic class in case a multiple-class LSP is being 
          requested. The index field value MUST correspond to at least  
          one of the Class-Type values included either in the CLASSTYPE  
          object [RFC4124] or in the EXTENDED_CLASSTYPE object [MCOS]. 
     
          A given index value j can be associated to at most N Class- 
          Type values CTi (i =< N) of the EXTENDED_CLASSTYPE object.  
          This applies in case a set of one or more CTi maps a single  
          (shared) BW profile. An example of value setting consists then  
          in assigning an arbitrary value comprised within the range  
          [0x08,0xF8[ associated to a set of CTi, the values in the  
          range [0xF8,0xFF] being selected for reserved sets. This  
          allows mapping to one of 248 pre-defined CTi sets. 
     
          A given index value j can be associated to a single CTi (1:1  
          correspondence). In this case, the index value setting  
          consists then in assigning the 3 LSB of the index field itself  
          to the CTi value itself (comprised in the range [0x00,0x07]).  
          This applies in case a single CTi maps a single (dedicated) BW  
          profile or multiple (dedicated) BW profiles. In the former  
          case (single BW profile), the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object  
          includes a single Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLV. In the  
          second case, the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC includes a set of more  
          than one Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLVs (whose respective  
          Index value is associated to a single CTi value).     
     
          Note that the current specification allows for combining  
          shared and dedicated BW profiles to the same LSP. That is, an  
          Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object MAY include multiple Ethernet  
          Bandwidth Profile TLVs whose respective index can be  
          associated on a 1:1 basis to a single CTi or to a set of  
          multiple CTi. 
        
          For each subobject of the EXTENDED_CLASSTYPE object [MCOS]: 
             o Each CTi value SHOULD correspond 1:1 to MEF CE VLAN-CoS

             o The BW requested per CTi field MAY be used for bandwidth 
               accounting purposes. 
             
          By default, the value of the Index field MUST be set to 0. 
        
       Reserved: 16 bits 
        
          These bits SHOULD be set to zero when sent and MUST be ignored 
          when received. 
        
       CIR (Committed Information Rate): 32 bits 
        
          The value of the CIR is in units of bytes per second. The CIR  
          is encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point  
          number (see [RFC4506]). 
        
          The CIR value MUST be greater than or equal to 0. 
        
       CBS (Committed Burst Size): 32 bits 
        
          The value of the CBS is in units of bytes. The CBS is encoded 
          as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number (see 
          [RFC4506]). 
        
          When CIR is strictly greater than 0 (CIR > 0), the CBS MUST be 
          greater than or equal to the maximum frame size. 
        
       EIR (Excess Information Rate): 32 bits 
        
          The value of the EIR is in units of bytes per second. The EIR 
          is encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point 
          number (see [RFC4506]). 
        
          The EIR value MUST be greater than or equal to 0. 
        
       EBS (Excess Burst Size): 32 bits 
        
          The value of the EBS is in units of bytes. The EBS is encoded 
          as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number (see 
          [RFC4506]). 
        
          When EIR is strictly greater than 0 (EIR > 0), the EBS MUST be 
          greater than or equal to the maximum frame size.

       IANA, with recommended value 6) has the same format as the 
       Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object. 
        
    6. Ethernet ADSPEC Object 
        
       There is no ADSPEC object associated with the Ethernet 
       SENDER_TSPEC object. 
        
       Either the ADSPEC object is omitted or an IntServ ADSPEC with the 
       Default General Characterization Parameters and Guaranteed 
       Service fragment is used, see [RFC2210]. 
        
    7. Processing 
        
       The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects specified in this 
       document MAY be used for signaling Ethernet LSP. For signaling 
       such LSP, in the Generalized LABEL_REQUEST object (see 
       [RFC3471]), the Switching Type field MUST be set to the value 51 
       (L2SC) and the LSP Encoding Type field MUST be set to the value 2 
       (Ethernet).   
        
       The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object carries the traffic 
       specification generated by the RSVP session sender. The Ethernet 
       SENDER_TSPEC object SHOULD be forwarded and delivered unchanged 
       to both intermediate and egress nodes. 
        
       The Ethernet FLOWSPEC object carries reservation request 
       information generated by receivers. As with any FLOWSPEC object, 
       Ethernet FLOWSPEC object flows upstream toward the ingress node. 
        
       Intermediate and egress nodes MUST verify that the node itself 
       and the interfaces on which the LSP will be established can 
       support the requested Switching Granularity, MTU and values 
       included in sub-object TLVs. These nodes MUST be configured with 
       the same pre-defined CT sets as the index value signaled as part 
       of the index field of the Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLV (see 
       Section 4.1). If the requested value(s) can not be supported, the 
       receiver node MUST generate a PathErr message with the error code 
       "Traffic Control Error" and the error value "Service unsupported" 
       (see [RFC2205]). 
        
       In addition, if the MTU field is received with a value smaller 
       than the minimum transfer unit size of the Ethernet frame (e.g. 
       46 bytes for Ethernet V2, 38 bytes for IEEE 802.3), the node MUST 
       generate a PathErr message with the error code "Traffic Control 
       Error" and the error value "Bad Tspec value" (see [RFC2205]).

       Error processing of the CLASSTYPE object follows rules defined in 
       [RFC4124]. Error processing of the EXTENDED_CLASSTYPE object 
       follows rules defined in [MCOS]. Moreover, an LSR receiving a 
       Path message with the EXTENDED_CLASSTYPE object, which recognizes 
       the object and the particular Class-Type but does detect a 
       mismatch in the index values, MUST send a PathErr message towards 
       the sender with the error code "Extended Class-Type Error" and 
       the error value "Class-Type mismatch" (see [RFC2205]).  
        
    8. Security Considerations 
        
       This document introduces no new security considerations to either 
       [RFC3473]. 
        
       GMPLS security is described in section 11 of [RFC3471] and refers 
       to [RFC3209] for RSVP-TE. Further details of MPLS-TE and GMPLS 
       security can be found in [MPLS-SEC]. 
        
    9. IANA Considerations 
        
       IANA maintain registries and sub-registries for RSVP-TE as used 
       by GMPLS. IANA is requested to make allocations from these 
       registries as set out in the following sections. 
        
    9.1. RSVP Objects Class Types 

       This document introduces two new Class Types for existing RSVP 
       objects. IANA is requested to make allocations from the "Resource 
       ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) Parameters" registry using the "Class 
       Names, Class Numbers, and Class Types" sub-registry.

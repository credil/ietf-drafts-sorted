Abstract 

   The Link Management Protocol (LMP) is used to coordinate the 
   properties, use, and faults of data links in Generalized 
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks. This document 
   defines an extension to LMP to negotiate capabilities and indicate 
   support for LMP extensions. The defined extension is compatible 
   with non-supporting implementations.

1. Introduction 

   The Link Management Protocol (LMP) [RFC4204] has been successfully 
   deployed in Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS)-
   controlled networks. 

   New LMP behaviors and protocol extensions have been introduced in a 
   number of IETF documents as set out later in this section. It is 
   likely that future extensions will be made to support additional 
   functions. 

   In a network, if one LMP node supports a new behavior or protocol 
   extension but its adjacent node does not, it is beneficial to have a 
   protocol mechanism to discover the capabilities of peer nodes so 
   that the right protocol extensions can be selected and the correct 
   features can be enabled. There are no such procedures defined in the 
   base LMP specification [RFC4204]. [RFC4209] defined a specific 
   mechanism to identify support for the functions defined in that 
   document. This document defines an LMP extension to support the 
   identification of supported LMP functions in a generic fashion, as 
   well as how a node supporting these extensions would communicate 
   with legacy nodes. 

   In [RFC4204], the basic behaviors have been defined around the use 
   of the standard LMP messages, which include Config, Hello, Verify, 
   Test, LinkSummary, and ChannelStatus. Per [RCF4204], these behaviors 
   MUST be supported when LMP is implemented, and the message types 
   from 1 to 20 have been assigned by IANA for these messages. Support 
   for all functions required by [RFC4204] is assumed by this document. 

   In [RFC4207], the SONET/SDH technology-specific behavior and 
   information for LMP is defined. The Trace behavior is added to LMP, 
   and the message types from 21 to 31 were assigned by IANA for the 
   messages that provide the TRACE function. The Trace function has 
   been extended for the support of OTNs (Optical Transport Networks) 
   in [LMP-TEST]. 

   In [RFC4209], extensions to LMP are defined to allow it to be used 
   between a peer node and an adjacent Optical Line System (OLS). The 
   LMP object class type and sub-object class name have been extended 
   to support DWDM behavior. 

   In [RFC5818], the data channel consistency check behavior is defined, 
   and the message types from 32 to 34 have been assigned by IANA for 
   messages that provide this behavior.

   It is likely that future extensions to LMP for other functions or 
   technologies will require the definition of further LMP messages. 

   This document describes an LMP extension, which is referred to as 
   behavior negotiation, which enables nodes at the ends of a link to 
   identify the LMP messages and functions supported by the adjacent 
   node. The extension makes use of a new CONFIG object. The use of 
   this new object does not preclude the use of existing or yet to be 
   defined CONFIG object. 

   This document also modifies the format of messages that carry CONFIG 
   object to allow for multiple objects. Multiple CONFIG objects allow 
   behavior negotiation concurrent with existing usage of the CONFIG 
   object, i.e., HelloConfig C-Type defined in [RFC4204] and 
   LMP_WDM_CONFIG C-Type defined in [RFC4209]. This document modifies 
   the ConfigAck message to include CONFIG objects so that acceptable 
   parameters are explicitly identified.  It also describes how a node 
   which supports the extensions defined in this document interacts 
   with a legacy LMP node. 

2. LMP Message Modifications 

   LMP Config, ConfigNack and ConfigAck messages are modified by this 
   document to allow for the inclusion of multiple CONFIG objects. The 
   Config and ConfigNack messages were only defined to carry on CONFIG 
   object in [RFC4204]. The ConfigAck message, which was defined 
   without carrying any CONFIG objects in [RFC4204], is modified to 
   enable explicit identification of negotiated configuration 
   parameters. The inclusion of CONFIG objects in ConfigAck messages is 
   triggered by the use of the BehaviorConfig object (defined below) in 
   a received Config message. 

2.1. Modified Message Formats 

   The format of the Config message as updated by this document is as 
   follows: 

   <Config Message> ::= <Common Header> <LOCAL_CCID> <MESSAGE_ID> 
                        <LOCAL_NODE_ID> <CONFIG> [ <CONFIG> ... ] 

   The format of the ConfigAck message as updated by this document is 
   as follows: 

   <ConfigAck Message> ::= <Common Header> <LOCAL_CCID> <LOCAL_NODE_ID> 
                           <REMOTE_CCID> <MESSAGE_ID_ACK> 
                           <REMOTE_NODE_ID>[ <CONFIG> ... ]

draft-ietf-ccamp-lmp-behavior-negotiation-04.txt            June 2011 
    

   The format of the ConfigNack message as updated by this document is 
   as follows: 

   <ConfigNack Message> ::= <Common Header> <LOCAL_CCID> 
                            <LOCAL_NODE_ID>  <REMOTE_CCID> 
                            <MESSAGE_ID_ACK> <REMOTE_NODE_ID> 
                            <CONFIG> [ <CONFIG> ... ] 

2.2. Processing 

   Nodes which support the extensions defined in this document MAY 
   include multiple CONFIG objects when sending a Config, ConfigAck and 
   ConfigNack message. A maximum of a single object of any particular 
   C-type SHALL be included. A node which receives a message with 
   multiple CONFIG objects of the same C-type SHALL process the first 
   object of a particular C-type and ignore any subsequent CONFIG 
   objects of the same C-type. Unless specified as part of the CONFIG 
   object definition, ordering of CONFIG objects is not significant. 

   Nodes which support the extensions defined in this document MUST 
   include a BehaviorConfig type object when sending a Config message 
   to a neighbor whose support for the extensions is either known or 
   unknown. (But not when the neighbor is known to not support the 
   extensions.) Inclusion of other CONFIG objects in a Config message 
   is at the discretion of the message sender, and is based on the 
   rules defined by as part of CONFIG object definition.  Nodes MAY 
   include, HelloConfig, LMP_WDM_CONFIG, BehaviorConfig object types in 
   a single message. 

   Inclusion of multiple CONFIG objects in a ConfigNack message is 
   based on the processing of a received Config message. Per [RFC4204] 
   "Parameters where agreement was reached MUST NOT be included in the 
   ConfigNack Message." As such, a ConfigNack message MUST NOT include 
   CONFIG objects which are acceptable and MUST include any CONFIG 
   objects which are not acceptable. When a CONFIG object is included 
   in a ConfigNack message, per [RFC4204], the object is to include 
   "acceptable alternate values for negotiable parameters". 

   When sending a ConfigAck message, nodes supporting the extensions 
   defined in this document MUST include all CONFIG objects received in 
   the corresponding Config message when that message includes a CONFIG 
   object of type BehaviorConfig.

3. LMP Behavior Negotiation  

   The Config message is used in the control channel negotiation phase 
   of LMP [RFC4204]. The LMP behavior negotiation procedure is defined 
   in this document as an addition to this phase. 

   The Config message is defined in Section 12.3.1 of [RFC4204] and 
   carries the CONFIG object (class name 6) as defined in Section 13.6 
   of [RFC4204].  

   Two class types have been defined: 

   - C-Type = 1, HelloConfig, defined in [RFC4204] 

   - C-Type = 2, LMP_WDM_CONFIG, defined in [RFC4209] 

   This document defines a third C-Type to report and negotiate LMP 
   mechanisms and behaviors. Its usage indicates support for the 
   extensions defined in this document. 

3.1. BehaviorConfig C-Type Format 

   Class = 6 

   - C-Type = (To be assigned by IANA), BehaviorConfig 

    0                   1                   2                   3  
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |S|D|C|                   Must Be Zero (MBZ)                    | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   Flags: 

     S: 1 bit 

      This bit indicates support for the Trace behavior of SONET/SDH   
      technology-specific defined in [RFC4207].  

     D: 1 bit 

      This bit indicates support for the DWDM behavior defined in 
      [RFC4209].

draft-ietf-ccamp-lmp-behavior-negotiation-04.txt            June 2011 
    

     C: 1 bit 

      This bit indicates support for the data channel consistency check 
      behavior defined in [RFC5818]. 

     Must Be Zero (MBZ): Variable length 

      The remaining bits in the flags field MUST be set to zero (0). 
      The number of bits present is based on the Length field of the 
      LMP object header and MUST include enough bits so the Length 
      field MUST be at least 8, and MUST be a multiple of 4.  

      Other bits may be defined in future documents, in which case the 
      number of MBZ bits field is expected to change. 

3.2. Processing 

   The inclusion of a BehaviorConfig type object in a message is 
   discussed above in Section 2.2.  

   When sending a BehaviorConfig type object, the N-bit (negotiable) in 
   the LMP object header must be set (N=1) in the LMP object header. 

   When sending a BehaviorConfig type object in Config and ConfigNack 
   messages, the flags field SHOULD be set based on the supported 
   capabilities of the sending node. When sending a ConfigAck message, 
   the flags field MUST be set to the value received in the 
   corresponding Config message. 

   When receiving a BehaviorConfig type object, the node compares the 
   flags field against its capacities.  Any bit set in the MBZ portion 
   of the flags field MUST be interpreted as unacceptable. Processing 
   related to unacceptable values in CONFIG objects is defined in 
   [RFC4204] and is not modified by this document. 

4. Backward Compatibility 

   The required use of the BehaviorConfig type CONFIG object enables 
   nodes which support the extensions defined in this document to 
   explicitly identify when a neighboring node does not. When a non-
   supporting node receives a Config message with the BehaviorConfig 
   type CONFIG object or multiple CONFIG objects its behavior is likely 
   to be one of the following behaviors: 

   a) Reject the Config message because of the unknown BehaviorConfig 
      object type and send a ConfigNack message which includes the 
      unsupported C-type. 
 
 
Li. et al.               Expires December 2011               [Page 7] 

draft-ietf-ccamp-lmp-behavior-negotiation-04.txt            June 2011 
    

   b) Reject the message because of multiple CONFIG objects and send a 
      ConfigNack message which includes all but one of the CONFIG 
      objects. 

   c) Silently ignore the one or more of the CONFIG object, and respond 
      with a ConfigAck message that does not include any CONFIG objects. 

   d) Treat the message as malformed, and discard it without any 
      response. 

   Behaviors (a) and (b) result in ConfigNack messages with a 
   BehaviorConfig type object whose contents are identical to what was 
   sent in the Config message.  Behavior (c) results in a ConfigAck 
   message without a BehaviorConfig type CONFIG object. In each of 
   these cases, the node SHOULD explicitly identify that the LMP 
   neighbor does not support the extensions defined in this document.  

   Behavior (d) results in no response at all. When the node reaches 
   the, [RFC4204] defined, "retry limit", the node SHOULD infer that 
   the LMP neighbor does not support the extensions defined in this 
   document. 

   Once a node identifies a neighbor as not supporting the extensions 
   defined in this document, the node SHOULD follow previously defined 
   Config message usage. 

5. Security Considerations 

   [RFC4204] describes how LMP messages between peers can be secured, 
   and these measures are equally applicable to messages carrying the 
   new CONFIG object defined in this document.  

   The procedures described in this document do not of itself 
   constitute a security risk since they do not cause any change in 
   network state. It would be possible, if the messages were 
   intercepted or spoofed to cause bogus alerts in the management plane, 
   or to cause LMP peers to consider that they could or could not 
   operate protocol extensions, and so the use of the LMP security 
   measures are RECOMMENDED. 

   Note, however, that [RFC4204] refers to [RFC2401], which has been 
   replaced by [RFC4301]. Also, the reference to IKEv2 in [RFC4301] is 
   out of date, and the current reference for IKEv2 is [RFC5996].

6. IANA Considerations 

6.1. New LMP Class Type 

   IANA maintains the "Link Management Protocol (LMP)" registry which 
   has a subregistry called "LMP Object Class name space and Class type 
   (C-Type)". 

   IANA is requested to make an assignment from this registry as 
   follows: 

      6   CONFIG                              [RFC4204] 

   CONFIG Object Class type name space: 

   C-Type        Description            Reference  
   ------------  ---------------------  ---------  
   3(suggested)  BehaviorConfig        [This.I-D] 
    
6.2. New Capabilities Registry 

   IANA is requested to create a new subregistry of the "Link 
   Management Protocol (LMP)" registry to track the Behaviour 
   Configuration bits defined in Section 2 of this document. It is 
   suggested that this registry be called "LMP Behaviour Configuration 
   Flags". 

   Allocations from this registry are by Standards Action. 

   Bits in this registry are numbered from zero as the most significant 
   bit (transmitted first). The number of bits that can be present is 
   limited by the length field of the CONFIG object which gives rise to 
   (255 x 32)-8 = 8152. IANA is strongly recommended to allocate new 
   bits with the lowest available unused number. 

   The registry is initially populated as follows: 

   Bit    | Bit  | Meaning                                | Reference 
   Number | Name |                                        |  
   -------+------+----------------------------------------+---------- 
     0    |   S  | SONET/SDH Test support                 | [This.ID] 
     1    |   D  | DWDM support                           | [This.ID] 
     2    |   C  | Data Channel consistency check support | [This.ID]

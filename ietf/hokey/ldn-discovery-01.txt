                   draft-ietf-hokey-ldn-discovery-01

Abstract

   In order to derive a Domain-Specific Root Key (DSRK) from the
   Extended Master Session Key (EMSK) generated as a side-effect of an
   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) method, the EAP peer must
   discover the name of the domain to which it is attached.

   This document specifies a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
   option designed to allow a DHCP server to inform clients of the name
   of the local domain..

Internet-Draft      The Local Domain Name DHCP Option          July 2010


1.  Introduction

   The EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP) [RFC5296] is designed to
   allow faster re-authentication of a mobile device which was
   previously authenticated by means of the Extensible Authentication
   Protocol (EAP, [RFC3748].  Given that the local root key (e.g., DSRK
   RFC 5295 [RFC5295]) is generated using the local domain name (LDN),
   LDN discovery is an important part of re-authentication.  As
   described in RFC 5296 [RFC5296], the local domain name can be learned
   by the mobile device through the ERP exchange or via a lower-layer
   mechanism.  However, no lower-layer mechanisms for LDN discovery have
   yet been defined.

   This document specifies an extension to DHCP for local domain name
   discovery.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Option Format

   In DHCPv6-based local domain name discovery, the LDN option is used
   by the DHCPv6 client (MD) to obtain the local domain name from the
   DHCP Server after full EAP authentication has taken place.

3.1.  DHCPv6 Local Domain Name Option

   The format of this option is:

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | OPTION_LOCAL_DOMAIN_NAME      |         option-length         |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |             local-domain-name ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Internet-Draft      The Local Domain Name DHCP Option          July 2010


   local-domain-name  This field contains the name of the local domain
      and MUST be encoded as specified in Section "8 of RFC 3315
      [RFC3315]

4.  Appearance of the Option

   The LDN option MUST NOT appear in DHCPv6 messages other than the
   types Solicit, Advertise, Request, Information-Request and Reply.
   The option-code of the LDN option MAY be included in the Option
   Request Option in the DHCPv6 message types Solicit, Request and
   Information-Request.

5.  Client Behavior

   If a DHCPv6 client (MD) doesn't know the local domain name and
   requires the DHCP Server to provide the DHCPv6 LDN option, it MUST
   include an Option Request option requesting the DHCPv6 LDN option, as
   described in Section 22.7 of RFC 3315 [RFC3315].

   When the DHCPv6 client recieves a LDN option with the local domain
   name present in it, it MUST verify that the option length is no more
   than 256 octets (the maximum length of a single FQDN allowed by DNS),
   and that the local domain name is a properly encoded single FQDN, as
   specified in Section 8 "Representation and Use of Domain Names" of
   the RFC3315 [RFC3315].

6.  Relay Agent Behavior

   If a DHCPv6 relay agent has pre-existing knowledge of the local
   domain name (for example, from a previous AAA exchange), it SHOULD
   include it in the DHCPv6 LDN option and forward to the DHPv6 server.

7.  Server Behavior

   If the option code for the LDN option is included in an Option
   Request option, the server SHOULD return the DHCPv6 LDN option to the
   client.  If a DHCPv6 LDN option is received from a relay agent with a
   non-empty local-domain-name field, the server SHOULD extract this
   option and include it in the reply message.

8.  Security Considerations

   The communication between the DHCP client and the DHCP server for the
   exchange of local domain name information is security sensitive and
   requires authentication, integrity and replay protection.  Either
   lower-layer security (such as link layer security established as part
   of the network access authentication protocol run) or DHCP security
   [RFC3118] can be used.

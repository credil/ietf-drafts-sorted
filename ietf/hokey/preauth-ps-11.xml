      <t>EAP early authentication may be defined as the use of EAP by a mobile
      device to establish authenticated keying material on a target attachment
      point prior to its arrival. This draft discusses the EAP early
      authentication problem in detail.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>When a mobile device, during an active communication session, moves
      from one access network to another and changes its attachment point, the
      session may be subjected to disruption of service due to the delay
      associated with the handover operation. The performance requirements of
      a real-time application will vary based on the type of application and
      its characteristics such as delay and packet loss tolerance. For Voice over IP
      applications, ITU-T G.114 <xref target="ITU"></xref> recommends a
      steady-state end-to-end delay of 150 ms as the upper limit and rates 400
      ms as generally unacceptable delay. Similarly, a streaming application
      has tolerable packet error rates ranging from 0.1 to 0.00001 with a
      transfer delay of less than 300 ms. Any help that an optimized handoff
      mechanism can provide toward meeting these objectives is useful. The
      ultimate objective is to achieve seamless handover with low latency,
      even when handover is between different link technologies or between
      different AAA realms. <vspace blankLines="1" /> As a mobile device goes
      through a handover process, it is subjected to delay because of the
      rebinding of its association at or across several layers of the protocol
      stack and because of the additional round trips needed for a new EAP
      exchange. Delays incurred within each protocol layer affect the ongoing
      multimedia application and data traffic within the client <xref
      target="WCM"></xref>. <vspace blankLines="1" /> The handover process
      often requires authentication and authorization for acquisition or
      modification of resources assigned to the mobile device. In most cases,
      these authentication and authorization require interaction with a
      central authority in a realm. In some cases the central authority may be
      distant from the mobile device. The delay introduced due to such an
      authentication and authorization procedure adds to the handover latency
      and consequently affects ongoing application sessions <xref
      target="MQ7"></xref> The discussion in this document is focused on
      mitigating delay due to EAP authentication.</t>

      <t><list hangIndent="" style="symbols">
          <t>handover preparation and</t>

          <t>handover execution</t>
        </list></t>

      <section title="Handover Preparation">
        <t>Handover preparation includes the discovery of candidate attachment
        points and selection of an appropriate target attachment point from
        the candidate set. Handover preparation is outside the scope of this
        document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Handover Execution">
        <t>Handover execution consists of setting up Layer 2 (L2) and Layer 3
        (L3) connectivity with the TAP. Currently, handover execution includes
        network access authentication and authorization performed directly
        with the target network; this may include full EAP authentication in
        the absence of any particular optimization for handover key
        management. Following a successful EAP authentication, a secure
        association procedure is typically performed between the mobile device
        and the TAP to derive a new set of link-layer encryption keys from EAP
        keying material such as the MSK. The handover latency introduced by
        full EAP authentication has proven to be higher than that which is
        acceptable for real-time application scenarios <xref
        target="MQ7"></xref>; hence, reduction in handover latency due to EAP
        is a necessary objective for such scenarios.</t>

        <section title="Examples">
          <section title="IEEE 802.11">
            <t>In IEEE 802.11 WLANs <xref target="IEEE.802-11.2007"></xref>
            network access authentication and authorization involves
            performing a new IEEE 802.1X <xref
            target="IEEE.802-1X.2004"></xref> message exchange with the
            authenticator in the TAP to execute an EAP exchange with the
            authentication server <xref target="WPA"></xref>.There has been
            some optimization work undertaken by the IEEE, but these efforts
            have been scoped to IEEE link layer technologies; for example, the
            work done in the IEEE 802.11f <xref
            target="IEEE.802-11F.2003"></xref> and 802.11r <xref
            target="IEEE.802-11R.2008"></xref> Task Groups applies only to
            intra- technology handovers.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="3GPP TS33.402">
            <t>3GPP Technical Specification 33.402 <xref
            target="TS33.402"></xref>, defines the authentication and key
            management procedures performed during interworking between
            non-3GPP access networks and the Evolved Packet System (EPS).
            Network access authentication and authorization happens after the
            L2 connection is established between the mobile device and a
            non-3GPP target access network, and involves an EAP exchange
            between the mobile device and the 3GPP AAA server via the non-3GPP
            target access network. These procedures are not really independent
            of link technology, since they assume either that the
            authenticator lies in the EPS network or that separate
            authentications are performed in the access network and then in
            the EPS network.</t>
          </section>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Solution Space">
        <t>As the examples in the preceding sections illustrate, a solution is
        needed to enable EAP early authentication for inter-AAA-realm
        handovers and inter-technology handovers. A search for solutions at
        the IP level may offer the necessary technology independence.</t>

        <t>Optimized solutions for secure inter-authenticator handovers can be
        seen either as security context transfer (e.g., using the EAP
        Extensions for EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP)) <xref
        target="RFC5296"></xref>, or as EAP early authentication.</t>

        <section title="Context Transfer">
          <t>Security context transfer involves transfer of reusable key
          context to the TAP and can take two forms:<list style="symbols">
              <t>Horizontal and</t>

              <t>Vertical</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Horizontal security context transfer (e.g., from SAP to TAP) is
          not recommended because of the possibility that the compromise of
          one attachment point might lead to the compromise of another (the
          so- called Domino effect, <xref target="RFC4962"></xref>). Vertical
          context transfer is similar to the initial establishment of keying
          material on an attachment point in that the keys are sent from a
          trusted server to the TAP as a direct result of a successful
          authentication. ERP specifies vertical context transfer using
          existing EAP keying material obtained from the home AAA server
          during the initial authentication. A cryptographically independent
          re-authentication key is derived and transmitted to the TAP as a
          result of successful ERP authentication. This reduces handover delay
          for intra-realm handovers by eliminating the need to run full EAP
          authentication with the home EAP server.</t>

          <t>However, in the case of inter-realm handover, ERP is either not
          applicable or an additional optimization mechanism is needed to
          establish a key on the TAP.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Early Authentication">
          <t>In EAP early authentication, AAA-based authentication and
          authorization for a CAP is performed while ongoing data
          communication is in progress via the serving access network, the
          goal being to complete AAA signaling for EAP before the mobile
          device moves. The applicability of EAP early authentication is
          limited to the scenarios where candidate authenticators can be
          discovered and an accurate prediction of movement can be easily
          made. In addition, the effectiveness of EAP early authentication may
          be less significant for particular inter-technology handover
          scenarios where simultaneous use of multiple technologies is not a
          major concern.</t>

          <t>There are also several AAA issues related to EAP early
          authentication, discussed in <xref

    <section title="System Overview">
      <t><xref target="figure-earlyauth"></xref> shows the functional elements
      that are related to EAP early authentication. These functional elements
      include a mobile device, a SAP, a CAP and one or more AAA and EAP
      servers; for the sake of convenience, the AAA and EAP servers are
      represented as being co- located. When the SAP and CAP belong to
      different AAA realms, the CAP may require a different set of user
      credentials than those used by the peer when authenticating to the SAP.
      Alternatively, the CAP and the SAP may rely on the same AAA server,
      located in the home realm of the mobile device (MD).</t>

      <t>A mobile device is attached to the serving access network. Before the
      MD performs handover from the serving access network to a candidate
      access network, it performs EAP early authentication with a candidate
      authenticator via the serving access network. The peer may perform EAP
      early authentication with one or more candidate authenticators. It is
      assumed that each attachment point has an IP address. It is assumed that
      there is at least one CAP in each candidate access network. The serving
      and candidate access networks may use different link layer
      technologies.</t>

      <t>Each authenticator is either a standalone authenticator or pass-
      through authenticator <xref target="RFC3748"></xref>. When an
      authenticator acts as a standalone authenticator, it also has the
      functionality of an EAP server. When an authenticator acts as a
      pass-through authenticator, it communicates with the EAP server,
      typically using a AAA transport protocol such as RADIUS <xref
      target="RFC2865"></xref> or Diameter <xref target="RFC3588"></xref>.</t>

      <t>If the CAP uses an MSK <xref target="RFC5247"></xref> for generating
      lower-layer ciphering keys, EAP early authentication is used to
      proactively generate an MSK for the CAP.</t>

    <section anchor="TopClass"
             title="Topological Classification of Handover Scenarios">
      <t>The complexity of the authentication and authorization part of
      handover depends on whether it involves a change in EAP Server. Consider
      first the case where the authenticators operate in pass- through mode,
      so that the EAP Server is co-located with a AAA server. Then there is a
      strict hierarchy of complexity, as follows:<list style="numbers">
          <t>inter-attachment-point handover with common AAA server: the CAP
          and SAP are different entities, but the AAA server is the same.
          There are two sub-cases here:<list style="format (%c)">
              <t>the AAA server is common because both attachment points lie
              within the same network, or</t>

              <t>the AAA server is common because AAA entities in the serving
              and candidate networks proxy to a AAA server in the home
              realm.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>inter-AAA-realm handover: the CAP and SAP are different entities,
          and the respective AAA servers also differ. As a result,
          authentication in the candidate network requires a second set of
          user credentials.</t>

      <t>A third case is where one or both authenticators are co-located with
      an EAP server. This has some of the characteristics of an inter-AAA-
      realm handover, but offers less flexibility for resolution of the early
      authentication problem.</t>

      <t>Orthogonally to this classification, one can distinguish intra-
      technology handover from inter-technology handover, thinking of the link
      technologies involved. In the inter-technology case, it is highly
      probable that the authenticators will differ. The most likely cases are
      1(b) or 2 in the above list.</t>

    <section title="Models of Early Authentication">
      <t>As noted in <xref target="PS"></xref>, there are cases where early
      authentication is applicable while ERP does not work. This section
      concentrates on providing some models around which we can build our
      analysis of the EAP early authentication problem. Different usage models
      can be defined depending on whether<list style="symbols">
          <t>the SAP is not involved in early authentication (direct pre-
          authentication usage model),</t>

          <t>the SAP interacts only with the CAP (indirect pre-authentication
          usage model), or</t>

          <t>the SAP interacts with the AAA server (the authenticated
          anticipatory keying usage model).</t>
        </list>It is assumed that the CAP and SAP are different entities. It
      is further assumed in describing these models that there is no direct L2
      connectivity between the peer and the candidate attachment point.</t>

      <section title="EAP Pre-authentication Usage Models">
        <t>In the EAP pre-authentication model, the SAP does not interact with
        the AAA server directly. Depending on how the SAP is involved in the
        pre-authentication signaling, the EAP pre-authentication usage model
        can be further categorized into the following two sub-models, direct
        and indirect.</t>

        <section title="The Direct Pre-authentication Model">
          <t>In this model, the SAP is not involved in the EAP exchange and
          only forwards the EAP pre-authentication traffic as it would any
          other data traffic. The direct pre-authentication model is based on
          the assumption that the MD can discover candidate authenticators and
          establish direct IP communication with them. It is applicable to any
          of the cases described in <xref target="TopClass"></xref>.

        server on the other side. The role of the candidate authenticator is
        to receive the transported keying materials from the EAP server and to
        act as the serving attachment point after handover occurs. The Peer-SA

        operate over L3.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Architectural Considerations">
      <t>There are two architectural issues relating to early authentication:
      authenticator discovery and context binding.</t>

      <section title="Authenticator Discovery">
        <t>In general, early authentication requires the identity of a
        candidate attachment point to be discovered by a peer, by a serving
        attachment point, or by some other entity prior to handover. An
        attachment point discovery protocol is typically defined as a separate
        protocol from an early authentication protocol. For example, the IEEE
        802.21 Information Service (IS) <xref target="IEEE.802-21"></xref>
        provides a link-layer- independent mechanism for obtaining neighboring
        network information by defining a set of Information Elements (IEs),
        where one of the IEs is defined to contain an IP address of a
        attachment point. IEEE 802.21 IS queries for such an IE may be used as
        a method for authenticator discovery. <vspace blankLines="1" /> If
        IEEE 802.21 IS or a similar mechanism is used, authenticator discovery
        requires a database of information regarding the target network; the
        provisioning of a server with such a database is another issue.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Context Binding">
        <t>When a candidate authenticator uses different EAP transport
        protocols for normal authentication and early authentication, a
        mechanism is needed to bind link-layer-independent context carried
        over early authentication signaling to the link-layer-specific context
        of the link to be established between the peer and the candidate
        authenticator. The link-layer-independent context includes the
        identities of the peer and authenticator as well as the MSK. The
        link-layer-specific context includes link layer addresses of the peer
        and the candidate authenticator. Such context binding can happen
        before or after the peer changes its point of attachment.<vspace
        blankLines="1" /> There are at least two possible approaches to
        address the context binding issue. The first approach is based on
        communicating the link layer context as opaque data via early
        authentication signaling. The second approach is based on running EAP
        over the link layer of the candidate authenticator after the peer
        arrives at the authenticator, using short-term credentials generated
        via early authentication. In this case, the short-term credentials are
        shared between the peer and the candidate authenticator. In both
        approaches, context binding needs to be securely made between the peer
        and the candidate authenticator. Also, the peer is not fully
        authorized by the candidate authenticator until the peer completes the
        link-layer- specific secure association procedure with the
        authenticator using link layer signaling.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="section-aaa-issues" title="AAA Issues">
      <t>Most of the AAA documents today do not distinguish between a normal
      authentication and an early authentication and this creates a set of
      open issues:<list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Early authentication authorization"><vspace
          blankLines="0" /> Users may not be allowed to have more than one
          logon session at the time. This means that while such users actively
          engage in a session (as a result of a previously valid
          authentication), they will not be able to perform early
          authentication. The AAA server currently has no way of
          distinguishing between a normal authentication request and an early
          authentication request.</t>

          <t hangText="Early authentication lifetime"><vspace
          blankLines="0" /> Currently, AAA protocols define attributes
          carrying lifetime information for a normal authentication session.
          Even when a user profile and the AAA server support early
          authentication, the lifetime for an early authentication session is
          typically valid only for a short amount of time because the peer has
          not completed its authentication at the target link layer. It is
          currently not possible for a AAA server to indicate to the AAA
          client or a peer the lifetime of the early authenticated session
          unless AAA protocols are extended to carry early authentication
          session lifetime information. In other words, it is not clear to the
          peer or the authenticator when the early authentication session will
          expire.</t>

          <t hangText="Early authentication retries"><vspace blankLines="0" />
          It is typically expected that shortly following the early
          authentication process, the peer moves to the new point of
          attachment and converts the early authentication state to a normal
          authentication state (the procedure for which is not the topic of
          this particular subsection). However, if the peer has not yet moved
          to the new location and realizes that the early authentication
          session is expiring, it may perform another early authentication.
          Some limiting mechanism is needed to avoid an unlimited number of
          early-authentication attempts.</t>

          <t hangText="Completion of network attachment"><vspace
          blankLines="0" /> Once the peer has successfully attached to the new
          point of attachment, it needs to convert its authentication state
          from early authenticated to fully attached and authorized. If the
          AAA server needs to differentiate between early authentication and
          normal authentication, there may need to be a mechanism within the
          AAA protocol to provide this indication to the AAA server. This may
          be important from a billing perspective if the billing policy does
          not charge for an early authenticated peer until the peer is fully
          attached to the target authenticator.</t>

          <t hangText="Session resumption"><vspace blankLines="0" /> In the
          case where the peer cycles between a network N1 with which it has
          fully authenticated to another network N2 and then back to N1, it
          should be possible to simply convert the fully authenticated state
          on N1 to an early authenticated state. The problems around handling
          session lifetime and keying material caching need to be dealt
          with.</t>

          <t hangText="Multiple candidate attachment points"><vspace
          blankLines="0" /> There may be situations where the peer needs to
          choose from among a number of CAPs. In such cases, it is desirable
          for the peer to perform early authentication with multiple candidate
          authenticators. This amplifies the difficulties noted under the
          point "Early authentication authorization".</t>

          <t hangText="Inter-AAA-realm handover support"><vspace
          blankLines="0" /> There may be situations where the peer moves out
          of the home AAA realm or across different visited AAA realms. In
          such cases, the early authentication should be performed through the
          visited AAA realm with the AAA server in the home AAA realm. It also
          requires AAA in the visited realm to acquire the identity
          information of the home AAA realms for routing the EAP early
          authentication traffic. Knowledge of realm identities is required by
          both the peer and AAA to generate the early authentication key for
          mutual authentication between the peer and the visited AAA
          server.</t>

          <t hangText="Inter-technology support"><vspace blankLines="0" />
          Current specifications on early authentication mostly deal with
          homogeneous 802.11 networks. AAA attributes such as Calling-
          Station-ID <xref target="I-D.aboba-radext-wlan"></xref> may need to
          be expanded to cover other access technologies. Furthermore,
          inter-technology handovers may require a change of the peer
          identifier as part of the handover. Investigation on the best type
          of identifiers for peers that support multiple access technologies
          is required.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-security-cons" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This section specifically covers threats introduced to the EAP model
      by early authentication. Security issues on general EAP and handover are
      described in other documents such as RFC 3748 <xref
      target="RFC3748"></xref>, RFC 4962 <xref target="RFC4962"></xref>,
      RFC5169 <xref target="RFC5169"></xref> and RFC5247 <xref
      target="RFC5247"></xref>. <vspace blankLines="1" /> Since early
      authentication as described in this document needs to work across
      multiple attachment points, any solution needs to consider the following
      security threats.<vspace blankLines="1" /> First, a resource consumption
      denial of service attack is possible, where an attacker that is not on
      the same IP link as the legitimate peer or the candidate authenticator
      may send unprotected early authentication messages to the legitimate
      peer or the candidate authenticator. As a result, the latter may spend
      computational and bandwidth resources on processing early authentication
      messages sent by the attacker. This attack is possible in both the
      direct and indirect pre-authentication scenarios. To mitigate this
      attack, the candidate network or authenticator may apply
      non-cryptographic packet filtering so that only early authentication
      messages received from a specific set of serving networks or
      authenticators are processed. In addition, a simple solution for the
      peer side would be to let the peer always initiate EAP early
      authentication and not allow EAP early authentication initiation from an
      authenticator. <vspace blankLines="1" />Second, consideration for the
      channel binding problem described in <xref target="RFC5247"></xref> is
      needed as lack of channel binding may enable an authenticator to
      impersonate another authenticator or communicate incorrect information
      via out-of-band mechanisms (such as via a AAA or lower layer protocol)
      <xref target="RFC3748"></xref>. It should be noted that it is relatively
      easier to launch such an impersonation attack for early authentication
      than normal authentication because an attacker does not need to be
      physically on the same link as the legitimate peer to send an early
      authentication trigger to the peer.</t>

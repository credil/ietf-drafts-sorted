<abstract>
   
   <t>This document defines extensions to the Kerberos protocol and the GSS-API Kerberos mechanism 
   that enable a GSS-API Kerberos client to exchange messages with the KDC using
   the GSS-API acceptor as the proxy, by encapsulating the Kerberos messages inside GSS-API tokens. 
   With these extensions a client can obtain Kerberos tickets for services where the KDC is not accessible to the client, but is
   accessible to the application server.</t>

</abstract>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>When authenticating using Kerberos V5, clients obtain tickets from a
   KDC and present them to services. This model of operation cannot work if the client does not have
   access to the KDC. For example, in remote access scenarios, 
   the client must initially authenticate to an access point in
   order to gain full access to the network. Here the client may be
   unable to directly contact the KDC either because it does not have an
   IP address, or the access point packet filter does not allow the
   client to send packets to the Internet before it authenticates to the
   access point.  </t>

<t>Recent advancements in extending Kerberos permit
Kerberos authentication to complete with the assistance of a proxy.  The Kerberos <xref target="RFC4120"/> pre-authentication framework <xref target="KRB-PAFW"/>  
prevents the exposure of weak client keys over the open network.
The Kerberos support of anonymity [KRB-ANON] provides for privacy and further complicates traffic analysis.
The kdc-referrals option defined in <xref target="KRB-PAFW"/> may reduce the number of messages exchanged while obtaining a ticket to exactly two
even in cross-realm authentications.</t>

 <t> Building upon these Kerberos extensions, this document extends <xref target="RFC4120"/> and 
    <xref target="RFC4121"/> such that the client can communicate with the KDC using a Generic Security Service
   Application Program Interface (GSS-API) <xref target="RFC2743"/> acceptor as the proxy. The GSS-API acceptor relays
   the KDC request and reply messages between the client and the KDC.

   The GSS-API acceptor, when relaying the Kerberos messages, is called an IAKERB proxy.

   Consequently, IAKERB as defined in this document requires the use of GSS-API.</t>

<section anchor="defs" title="GSS-API Encapsulation">

<t> The mechanism Objection Identifier (OID) for GSS-API IAKERB, in accordance
   with the mechanism proposed by <xref target="RFC4178"/> 
   for negotiating protocol variations, is id-kerberos-iakerb:</t>

<figure>
    <artwork>
   id-kerberos-iakerb ::= 
     { iso(1) org(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5) kerberosV5(2) 
       iakerb(5) } 
    </artwork>
</figure>
   
<t> All context establishment token of IAKERB MUST have the generic token framing described in section 3.1 of
   <xref target="RFC2743"/> with the mechanism OID being id-kerberos-iakerb.</t>

  <t> The client starts by constructing the ticket request, and if the ticket request 
  is being made to the KDC, the client, instead of contacting the KDC directly, encapsulates the request message
    into the output token of the GSS_Init_security_context() call and returns GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED <xref target="RFC2743"/> indicating that
    at least one more token is required in order to establish the context. The output
   token is then passed for use as the input token to the GSS_Accept_sec_context() call in accordance with GSS-API. The GSS-API acceptor extracts
   the Kerberos request in the input token, locates the target KDC, and sends the request on behalf of the client. 
   After receiving the KDC reply, the GSS-API
   acceptor then encapsulates the reply message into the output token of GSS_Accept_sec_context(). The GSS-API acceptor returns GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED <xref target="RFC2743"/> indicating that
    at least one more token is required in order to establish the context. The output token is passed to the initiator in accordance with GSS-API.</t>

<t> The innerToken described in section 3.1 of
   <xref target="RFC2743"/> and subsequent GSS-API mechanism tokens have the following formats: it starts with a two-octet token-identifier
   (TOK_ID), followed by an IAKERB message or a Kerberos message. </t>

<t> Only one IAKERB specific message, namely the IAKERB_PROXY message, is defined in this document. 
The TOK_ID values for Kerberos messages are the 
same as defined in <xref target="RFC4121"/>.</t>

<t>The content of the IAKERB_PROXY message is defined as an IAKERB-HEADER structure immediately followed by a Kerberos message.
The Kerberos message can be an AS-REQ, an AS-REP, a TGS-REQ, a TGS-REP, or a KRB-ERROR as defined in <xref target="RFC4120"/>.</t>

<figure>

        IAKERB-HEADER ::= SEQUENCE {
            target-realm      [1] UTF8String,
               -- The name of the target realm.
            cookie            [2] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL,
               -- Opaque data, if sent by the server,
               -- MUST be copied by the client verbatim into
               -- the next IAKRB_PROXY message.
            ...
        }
    </artwork>
</figure>

<t> The IAKERB-HEADER structure and all the Kerberos messages MUST
be encoded using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [X680] [X690]. </t>
              
<t>The IAKERB client fills out the IAKERB-HEADER structure as follows: 
the target-realm contains the realm name the ticket request is addressed to. In the initial message from the client, the cookie field is absent.
The client MUST specify a target-realm.  If the client does not
know the realm of the client's true principal name [REFERALS], it MUST specify a realm it knows.  This can be the realm of the client's host.
<!--
The GSS-API client can retrieve the default  realm of the GSS-API server by sending an IAKERB message with an empty target-realm in the IAKERB-HEADER 
and no Kerberos message following the IAKERB-HEADER struture. The GSS-API server fills out the traget realm field using the default realm (which could be the realm of the server host),
and sends back the IAKERB message with no Kerberos message following the header. The GSS-API client can use the returned realm in subsequent IAKERB messages. -->
</t>

<t> Upon receipt of the IAKERB_PROXY message, 
the GSS-API acceptor inspects the target-realm field in the IAKERB_HEADER, and locates a KDC of that realm, and sends the ticket request to that KDC. </t>
<t>The GSS-API server encapsulates
the KDC reply message in the returned IAKERB message. It fills out the target realm using the realm sent by the client and the KDC reply message is included
 immediately following the IAKERB-HEADER header.</t> 

<t> When the GSS-API acceptor is unable to obtain an IP address for a KDC in the
   client's realm, it sends a KRB_ERROR message with the code KRB_AP_ERR_IAKERB_KDC_NOT_FOUND to the client and the context fails to establish. There is no accompanying error data defined in
   this document for this error code.</t>

<figure>
    <artwork>
        KRB_AP_ERR_IAKERB_KDC_NOT_FOUND      85
            -- The IAKERB proxy could not find a KDC.
    </artwork>
</figure>

 <t>When the GSS-API acceptor has an IP address for a KDC in the client realm,
   but does not receive a response from any KDC in the realm (including
   in response to retries), it sends a KRB_ERROR message with the code KRB_AP_ERR_IAKERB_KDC_NO_RESPONSE to the client and the context fails to establish.  There is no accompanying error data defined 
   in this document for this error code.</t>

<figure>
    <artwork>
        KRB_AP_ERR_IAKERB_KDC_NO_RESPONSE    86
            -- The KDC did not respond to the IAKERB proxy.
    </artwork>
</figure>

<t>The IAKERB proxy can send opaque data in the cookie field of the IAKERB-HEADER structure in the server reply to the client,
in order to, for example, minimize the amount of state information kept by the GSS-API acceptor. 

The content and the encoding of
the cookie field is a local matter of the IAKERB proxy. The client MUST copy the cookie verbatim
from the previous server response whenever the cookie is present into the subsequent tokens that contains an IAKERB_PROXY message. </t>

<t>
  The client and the server can repeat the sequence of sending and receiving the IAKERB messages as described above, in order to allow the client interact with the KDC
through the IAKERB proxy, and to obtain Kerberos tickets as needed.
</t>

<t>
When obtaining the initial TGT, the client may start with an NT-ENTERPRISE name type and the client host does not have a Kerberos realm. To resolve the NT-ENTERPRISE name type, the client typically starts with the client host realm and then finds out the true realm of the client based on [REFERALS]. In this case the GSS-API client can retrieve the realm of the GSS-API server as follows: the client returns GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED with the output token containing an IAKERB message with an empty target-realm in the IAKERB-HEADER and no Kerberos message following the IAKERB-HEADER structure. Upon receipt of the realm request, the GSS-API server fills out the target realm field using the realm of the server, and returns GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED with the output token containing the IAKERB message with the server's realm and no Kerberos message following the IAKERB-HEADER header. The GSS-API client can then use the returned realm in subsequent IAKERB messages to resolve the NT-ENTERPRISE name type. Since the GSS-API server can act as a Kerberos acceptor, it always has a Kerberos realm in this case.
</t>

<t>When the client obtained a service ticket, 
the client sends a KRB_AP_REQ message to the server, and performs the client-server application exchange as defined in 
<xref target="RFC4120"/> and <xref target="RFC4121"/>.   </t>

<t>
For implementations conforming to this specification, both the authenticator subkey and the GSS_EXTS_FINISHED extension as defined in [PKU2U] MUST be present in the AP-REQ authenticator. This checksum provides integrity protection for the messages exchanged including the unauthenticated clear texts in the IAKERB-HEADER structure.  
</t>

<!--                                                             
<t>  For implementations conforming to this specification, the authenticator subkey in the AP-REQ MUST alway be present, 
and the Exts field in the GSS-API authenticator [GSS-EXTS] MUST contain an extension of the type GSS_EXTS_IAKERB_FINISHED 
and the extension data contains the ASN.1 DER encoding of the structure IAKERB-FINISHED. </t>

                 - - in the order that the tokens were sent.

    </artwork>
</figure>

<t>The iakerb-messages field in the  IAKERB-FINISHED structure contains a checksum of all the GSS-API
tokens exchanged between the initiator and the acceptor, and prior to the GSS-API token containing the AP_REQ. 
This checksum is performed over these GSS-API tokens in the order that the tokens were sent. 

In the parlance of <xref target="RFC3961"/>, the checksum type is the required checksum type
 for the enctype of the subkey in the authenticator,
 the protocol key for the checksum operation is the authenticator subkey, and the key usage number is KEY_USAGE_IAKERB_FINISHED.</t>

        KEY_USAGE_IAKERB_FINISHED            42

</figure>
<t>  The GSS-API acceptor MUST then verify
 the checksum contained in the GSS_EXTS_IAKERB_FINISHED extension. This checksum provides
 integrity protection for the messages exchanged including 
 the unauthenticated clear texts in the IAKERB-HEADER structure.</t>
-->

<t>If the pre-authentication data is encrypted in the long-term
   password-based key of the principal, the risk of security
   exposures is significant. Implementations
   SHOULD provide the AS_REQ armoring as defined in
  <xref target="KRB-PAFW"/> unless an alternative protection is deployed.  
   In addition, the anonymous
   Kerberos FAST option is RECOMMENDED for the client to complicate
   traffic analysis.</t>
   
</section>

<section title="Addresses in Tickets">

   <t>In IAKERB, the machine sending requests to the KDC is the GSS-API acceptor and
   not the client. As a result, the client should not include its
   addresses in any KDC requests for two reasons. First, the KDC may
   reject the forwarded request as being from the wrong client. Second,
   in the case of initial authentication for a dial-up client, the
   client machine may not yet possess a network address. Hence, as
   allowed by <xref target="RFC4120"/>, the addresses field of the AS-REQ and TGS-REQ
   requests SHOULD be blank and the caddr field of the ticket SHOULD
   similarly be left blank.</t>
</section>

 <section anchor="securityconsideration" title="Security Considerations" toc="default">

     <t> A typical IAKERB client sends the AS_REQ with pre-authentication data
     encrypted in the long-term keys of the user before the server is authenticated. This enables offline
     attacks by un-trusted servers. To mitigate this threat, the
     client SHOULD use Kerberos FAST<xref target="KRB-PAFW"/> and require KDC authentication to protect
     the user's credentials.</t>

     <t>The client name is in clear text in the authentication exchange
     messages and ticket granting service exchanges according to
 <xref target="RFC4120"/> whereas the client name is encrypted in client-
server application exchange messages.  By using the IAKERB proxy
     to relay the ticket requests and responses, the client's identity
     could be revealed in the client-server traffic where the same identity
     could have been concealed if IAKERB were not used.  
     Hence, to complicate traffic analysis and provide privacy for the IAKERB client, 
     the IAKERB client SHOULD request the anonymous Kerberos FAST option <xref target="KRB-PAFW"/>.</t>
   
     <t>Similar to other network access protocols, IAKERB allows an
   unauthenticated client (possibly outside the security perimeter of an
   organization) to send messages that are proxied to interior servers.
To reduce attack surface, firewall filters can be applied to allow from which hosts the client requests can be proxied and the proxy can further restrict the set of realms to which the requests can be proxied.
</t>

   <t> In a scenario where DNS SRV RR's are being used to locate the
   KDC, IAKERB is being used, and an external attacker can modify DNS
   responses to the IAKERB proxy, there are several countermeasures to
   prevent arbitrary messages from being sent to internal servers:<vspace blankLines="1"/>

   <list style="numbers"><t> KDC port numbers can be statically configured on the IAKERB
   proxy. In this case, the messages will always be sent to KDC's. For
   an organization that runs KDC's on a static port (usually port 88)
   and does not run any other servers on the same port, this
   countermeasure would be easy to administer and should be effective.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

   <t> The proxy can do application level sanity checking and filtering.
   This countermeasure should eliminate many of the above attacks.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

   <t> DNS security can be deployed. This countermeasure is probably
   overkill for this particular problem, but if an organization has
   already deployed DNS security for other reasons, then it might make
   sense to leverage it here. Note that Kerberos could be used to
   protect the DNS exchanges.  The initial DNS SRV KDC lookup by the
   proxy will be unprotected, but an attack here is at most a denial of
   service (the initial lookup will be for the proxy's KDC to facilitate
   Kerberos protection of subsequent DNS exchanges between itself and
   the DNS server).</t>

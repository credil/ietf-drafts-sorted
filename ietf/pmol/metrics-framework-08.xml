    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Many networking technologies, applications, or services, are distributed
      in nature, and their performance may be impacted by IP impairments, server 
      capacity, congestion and other factors. It is important to measure the 
      performance of applications and services to ensure that quality objectives 
      are being met and to support problem diagnosis. Standardized metrics help 
      to ensure that performance measurement is implemented consistently and facilitate 
      interpretation and comparison.</t>

      <t>There are at least three phases in the development of performance
      standards. They are:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Definition of a Performance Metric and its units of measure</t>

          <t>Specification of a method of measurement</t>

          <t>Specification of the reporting format</t>
        </list>
      During the development of metrics, it is often useful to define
      performance objectives and expected value ranges. However, this is not
      defined as part of the metric specification. </t>

     <t>
     The intended audience for this document includes, but is not
     limited to, IETF participants who write Performance Metrics documents
     in the IETF, reviewers of such documents, and members of the Performance
     Metrics Entity. 
     </t>

		<section title="Background and Motivation">
			<t>
				Although the IETF has two active Working Groups (WGs) dedicated to the
				development of Performance Metrics, they each have strict limitations
				in their charters:
			</t>

			<t>
				- The Benchmarking Methodology WG has addressed a range of
				networking technologies and protocols in their long history (such as
				IEEE 802.3, ATM, Frame Relay, and Routing Protocols), but the charter
				strictly limits their performance characterizations to the laboratory
				environment.
			</t>

			<t>
				- The IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) WG has developed a set of
				standard metrics that can be applied to the quality, performance, and reliability
				of Internet data delivery services.  The IPPM metrics development is applicable
				to live IP networks, but it is specifically prohibited from developing metrics that
				characterize traffic at upper layers, such as a VoIP stream.
			</t>

			<t>
				A Birds Of a Feather (BOF) held at IETF-69 introduced the IETF community to the
				possibility of a generalized activity to define standardized
				Performance Metrics. The existence of a growing list of
				Internet-Drafts on Performance Metrics (with community interest in
				development, but in un-chartered areas) illustrates the need for
				additional performance work. The majority of people present at the 
                        BOF supported the proposition that IETF should be working in these areas, 
                        and no one objected to any of the proposals.
			</t>

                  <t>
                        Previous IETF work related to reporting of application Performance Metrics
                        includes the "Real-time Application Quality-of-Service Monitoring (RAQMON) Framework"
                        <xref target="RFC4710">RFC 4710</xref>, which extends the remote network monitoring
                        (RMON) family of specifications to allow real-time quality-of-service (QoS)
                        monitoring of various applications that run on devices such as IP phones,
                        pagers, Instant Messaging clients, mobile phones, and various other
                        handheld computing devices. Furthermore, the "RTP Control Protocol Extended
                        Reports (RTCP XR)" <xref target="RFC3611">RFC 3611</xref> and the "SIP RTCP Summary
                        Report Protocol" <xref target="RFC6035"></xref> are
                        protocols that support the real-time reporting of Voice over IP and other
                        applications running on devices such as IP phones and mobile handsets.
                  </t>

			<t>
				The IETF is also actively involved in the development of reliable
				transport protocols, such as <xref target="RFC0793">TCP</xref> or 
                        <xref target="RFC4960">SCTP</xref>, which would affect the relationship 
                        between IP performance and application performance.
			</t>

			<t>
				Thus there is a gap in the currently chartered coverage of IETF
				WGs: development of Performance Metrics for protocols above and below
				the IP-layer that can be used to characterize performance on live networks.
			</t>

			<t>
                         This document refers to the implementation of a Performance Metrics Entity, 
                         whose goal is to advice and support the Performance Metric development at the IETF.
                         A recommendation about the Performance Metrics Entity is made
                         in Section 6.6.			
                  </t>
			<t>
                        Similarly to the "Guidelines for Considering Operations and Management of 
                        New Protocols and Protocol Extensions" RFC 5706 [RFC5706], which is the
                        reference document for the IETF Operations Directorate, this document
                        should be consulted as part of the new Performance Metric review.

      </section>

      <section title="Organization of this document">
        <t>This document is divided in two major sections beyond the "Purpose and
        Scope" section. The first is a definition and description of a
        Performance Metric and its key aspects. The second defines a process
        to develop these metrics that is applicable to the IETF
        environment.</t>
      </section>

    </section>
    
    <section title="Terminology">
		
		<section title="Performance Metrics Entity">
			<t>
				The Performance Metrics Entity is a directorate that coordinates
				the Performance Metric development in the IETF. 
			</t>
			<t>
				The Performance Metrics Entity should be composed of experts in the performance community,
				potentially selected from the IPPM, BMWG, and PMOL WGs.
			</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Quality of Service">
			<t>
				Quality of Service (QoS) is defined in a similar way to the ITU
				"QoS experienced/perceived by customer/user (QoE)"
				<xref target="E.800">E.800</xref>, i.e.:
				"Totality of characteristics of a telecommunications service that bear
				on its ability to satisfy stated and implied needs of the user of the service."
			</t>

		</section>

		<section title="Quality of Experience">
			<t>
				Quality of Experience (QoE) is defined in a similar way to the ITU
				"QoS experienced/perceived by customer/user (QoE)"
				<xref target="E.800">E.800</xref>, i.e.:
				"a statement expressing the level of quality that customers/users believe
				they have experienced."
			</t>
			<t>
				NOTE 1 â€“ The level of QoS experienced and/or perceived by the customer/user
				may be expressed by an opinion rating.
			</t>
			<t>
				NOTE 2 â€“ QoE has two main components: quantitative and
                        qualitative.  The quantitative component can be influenced by the
                        complete end-to-end system effects (including user devices and
                        network infrastructure).
			</t>
                  <t>
				NOTE 3 â€“ The qualitative component can be influenced by user expectations, 
				ambient conditions, psychological factors, application context, etc.
			</t>
			<t>
				NOTE 4 â€“ QoE may also be considered as QoS delivered, received, and 
				interpreted by a user with the pertinent qualitative factors influencing 
				his/her perception of the service.
			</t>
            </section>

		<section title="Performance Metric">
		     covers  <t>
				A quantitative measure of performance, specific to an IETF-specified protocol or 
                        specific to an application transported over an IETF-specified protocol. 
                        Examples of Performance Metrics are: the FTP response time for a complete file 
                        download, the DNS response time to resolve the IP address, a database logging time, 
                        etc.
			</t>
		</section>
    </section>


    <section title="Purpose and Scope">
     
		<t>The purpose of this document is to define a framework and a process
		for developing Performance Metrics for protocols above and below the IP-layer 
		(such as IP-based applications that operate over reliable or datagram transport 
		protocols), that can be used to characterize traffic on live networks and 
		services.  As such, this document does not define any Performance Metrics.</t>
		
		<t>The scope of this document covers guidelines for considering new Performance
            Metric development. However this document is not intended to
            supercede existing working methods within WGs that have existing
            chartered work in this area. </t>
		
		<t>This process is not intended to govern Performance Metric development
            in existing IETF WG that are focused on metrics development, such as
            IPPM and BMWG. However, this guidelines document may be useful in
            these activities, and MAY be applied where appropriate. A typical example 
            is the development of Performance Metrics to be exported with the IPFIX
            protocol <xref target="RFC5101">RFC 5101</xref>, with specific IPFIX information
            elements <xref target="RFC5102">RFC 5102</xref>, which would benefit from
           the framework in this document. </t>
      
           <t>The framework in this document applies to Performance Metrics derived from
           both active and passive measurements.</t>

    </section>
    
    <section title="Relationship between QoS, QoE and Application-specific Performance Metrics">
      <t> Network QoS deals with the network and network protocol performance, while QoE
	  deals with the assessment of a user's experience in a context of a task or a
	  service. As a result, the topic of application-specific Performance Metrics includes the
	  opportunities to quantify performance at layers between IP and the user.
	  For example, network QoS metrics (packet loss, delay, and delay variation 
	  <xref target="RFC5481"></xref>) can be used to estimate application-specific
	  Performance Metrics (de-jitter buffer size and RTP-layer packet loss), then
        combined with other known aspects of a VoIP application (such as codec type)
	  to estimate a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) <xref target="P.800"></xref>. 	  
	  However, the QoE for a particular VoIP user depends on the specific context, 
	  such as a casual conversation, a business conference call, or an emergency call.  
        Finally, QoS and application-specific Performance Metrics are quantitative, while QoE is 
        qualitative.  Also network QoS and application-specific Performance Metrics can be
	  directly or indirectly evident to the user, while the QoE is directly evident.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Performance Metrics Development">
      <t>This section provides key definitions and qualifications of
      Performance Metrics.</t>

      <section title="Identifying and Categorizing the Audience">
                
        <t>Many of the aspects of metric definition and reporting, even the 
        selection or determination of the essential metrics, depend on who 
        will use the results, and for what purpose. Some examples of how the 
        reports may be used include the proper maintenance of service quality 
        or to identify and quantify problems. The question, "How will the 
        results be used?" usually yields important factors to consider when 
        developing Performance Metrics.</t> 
        
        <t>All documents defining Performance Metrics SHOULD identify the primary
        audience and its associated requirements.  The audience can influence
        both the definition of metrics and the methods of measurement.</t>
        
        <t>The key areas of variation between different metric users include:</t>
        
        <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Suitability of passive measurements of live traffic, or active 
          measurements using dedicated traffic</t>
       
          <t>Measurement in laboratory environment, or on a network of deployed
          devices</t>
       
          <t>Accuracy of the results</t>
       
          <t>Access to measurement points and configuration information</t>
          
          <t>Measurement topology (point-to-point, point-to-multipoint)</t>
                    
          <t>Scale of the measurement system</t>
                              
          <t>Measurements conducted on-demand, or continuously</t>
                                        
          <t>Required reporting formats and periods</t>
                 
        </list></t>

      </section>
      
      <section title="Definitions of a Performance Metric">
        <t>A metric is a measure of an observable behavior of a networking technology, 
        an application, or a service. Most of the time, the metric can be 
        directly measured. However, sometimes, the metric definition is computed:
        it assumes some implicit or explicit underlying statistical process. 
        In such case, the metric is an estimate of a parameter of this process, 
        assuming that the statistical process closely models the behavior 
        of the system.</t>

        <t>A metric should serve some defined purpose. This may include the
        measurement of capacity, quantifying how bad some problem is,
        measurement of service level, problem diagnosis or location and other
        such uses. A metric may also be an input to some other process, for
        example the computation of a composite metric or a model or simulation
        of a system. Tests of the "usefulness" of a metric include:</t>

        <t><list style="empty">
            <t>(i) the degree to which its absence would cause significant
            loss of information on the behavior or performance of the application or
            system being measured</t>

            <t>(ii) the correlation between the Performance Metric, the QoS 
            <xref target="G.1000"></xref> and QoE delivered to the 
            user (person or other application)</t>
                        
            <t>(iii) the degree to which the metric is able to support the
            identification and location of problems affecting service
            quality.</t>
            
            <t>(iv) the requirement to develop policies (Service Level Agreement,
            and potentially Service Level Contract) based on the metric.</t>
            
          </list>For example, consider a distributed application operating
        over a network connection that is subject to packet loss. A Packet
        Loss Rate (PLR) metric is defined as the mean packet loss ratio over
        some time period. If the application performs poorly over network
        connections with high packet loss ratio and always performs well when
        the packet loss ratio is zero then the PLR metric is useful to some
        degree. Some applications are sensitive to short periods of high loss
        (bursty loss) and are relatively insensitive to isolated packet loss
        events; for this type of application there would be very weak
        correlation between PLR and application performance. A "better" metric
        would consider both the packet loss ratio and the distribution of loss
        events. If application performance is degraded when the PLR exceeds
        some rate then a useful metric may be a measure of the duration and
        frequency of periods during which the PLR exceeds that rate.</t>
        
      </section>

      <section title="Computed Metrics">
        <section title="Composed Metrics">
			
        <t>Some metrics may not be measured directly, but can be composed from
        base metrics that have been measured. A composed metric is derived from 
        other metrics by applying a deterministic process or function (e.g., 
        a composition function). The process may use metrics that are identical 
        to the metric being composed, or metrics that are dissimilar, or some 
        combination of both types. Usually the base metrics have a limited scope 
        in time or space, and they can be combined to estimate the performance 
        of some larger entities.</t>
        
        
        <t>Some examples of composed metrics and composed metric definitions 
        are:</t>

        <t>Spatial composition is defined as the composition of metrics of the
        same type with differing spatial domains 
        <xref target="RFC5835"></xref> 
        <xref target="RFC6049"></xref>. For spatially
        composed metrics to be meaningful, the spatial domains should be non-overlapping 
		and contiguous, and the composition operation should be mathematically appropriate 
		for the type of metric.</t>

        <t>Temporal composition is defined as the composition of sets of metrics
        of the same type with differing time spans <xref target="RFC5835"></xref>. For temporally
        composed metrics to be meaningful, the time spans should be
        non-overlapping and contiguous, and the composition operation should
        be mathematically appropriate for the type of metric.</t>

        <t>Temporal aggregation is a summarization of metrics into a smaller
        number of metrics that relate to the total time span covered by the
        original metrics. An example would be to compute the minimum,
        maximum and average values of a series of time sampled values of a
        metric.</t>

	    <t>In the context of flow records in IP Flow Informatin eXport (IPFIX), the IPFIX Mediation: 
		Framework <xref target="I-D.ietf-ipfix-mediators-framework"></xref> also discusses some 
		aspects of the temporal and spatial composition. </t>

		</section>
        
        <section title="Index">
        <t>An Index is a metric for which the output value range has been
        selected for convenience or clarity, and the behavior of which is
        selected to support ease of understanding; for example the R Factor 
        <xref target="G.107"></xref>. The deterministic function for an index 
        is often developed after the index range and behavior have been 
        determined.</t>

        </section>
        
      </section>

      <section title="Performance Metric Specification">
        <section title="Outline">

        <t>A Performance Metric definition MUST have a normative part that defines what
        the metric is and how it is measured or computed and SHOULD have an
        informative part that describes the Performance Metric and its application. </t>
 
       </section>

        <section title="Normative parts of Performance Metric definition">

        <t>The normative part of a Performance Metric definition MUST define at least the
        following: </t>

        <t>(i) Metric Name</t>
        
        <t> Performance Metric names MUST be unique within the set of metrics being defined	 		
	        and MAY be descriptive.</t>

        <t> (ii) Metric Description</t>
        <t> The Performance Metric description MUST explain what the metric is, what is being	 		
	        measured and how this relates to the performance of the system being			
	        measured.</t>

        <t> (iii) Method of Measurement or Calculation</t>

        <t>
			This method of measurement or calculation MUST define what is being
			measured or computed and the specific algorithm to be used.  Does the
			measurement involve active or only passive measurements? Terms such
			as "average" should be qualified (e.g. running average or average over
			some interval). Exception cases SHOULD also be defined with the
			appropriate handling method. For example, there are a number of commonly
			used metrics related to packet loss; these often don't define the criteria
			by which a packet is determined to be lost (vs very delayed) or how
			duplicate packets are handled. For example, if the average packet
			loss rate during a time interval is reported, and a packet's arrival
			is delayed from one interval to the next then was it "lost" during
			the interval during which it should have arrived or should it be
			counted as received?</t>
          
          <t>Some parameters linked to the method MAY also be reported, in 
          order to fully interpret the Performance Metric. For example, the 
          time interval, the load, the minimum packet loss, the potential measurement 
          errors and their sources, the attainable accuracy of the metric (e.g. +/-0,1)
          etc.. 
          </t>

        <t>(iv) Units of measurement </t>
        
        <t>The units of measurement MUST be clearly stated.</t>
        
        <t> (v) Measurement Point(s)</t>
         
        <t>If the measurement is specific to a measurement point, this SHOULD be
        defined. The measurement domain MAY also be defined. Specifically, if 
        measurement points are spread across domains, the measurement domain 
        (intra-, inter-) is another factor to consider.</t>

		<t>In some cases, the measurement requires multiple measurement points: all measurement 
		points SHOULD be defined, including the measurement domain(s).</t>
         
        <t> (vi) Measurement timing</t>

        <t>The acceptable range of timing intervals or sampling intervals for a
           measurement and the timing accuracy required for such intervals MUST
           be specified. Short sampling intervals or frequent samples provide
           a rich source of information that can help to assess application
           performance but may lead to excessive measurement data. Long 
           measurement or sampling intervals reduce the amount of reported
           and collected data such that it may be insufficient to understand
           application performance or service quality insofar as the measured 
           quantity may vary significantly with time.</t>

		  <t>In case of multiple measurement points, the potential requirement
		  for synchronized clocks must be clearly specified. In the specific example
	      of the IP delay variation application metric, the different aspects of synchronized 
	      clocks are discussed in  <xref target="RFC5481"></xref>.</t>

        <section title="Informative parts of Performance Metric definition"></section>

           <t>The informative part of a Performance Metric specification is intended to support
              the implementation and use of the metric. This part SHOULD provide
              the following data:</t> 

           <t>(i) Implementation </t>
        
           <t>The implementation description MAY be in the form of text, algorithm
              or example software. The objective of this part of the metric
              definition is to assist implementers to achieve consistents results.</t>

           <t>(ii) Verification</t>
      
           <t>The Performance Metric definition SHOULD provide guidance on verification
              testing. This may be in the form of test vectors, a formal
              verification test method or informal advice.</t>

           <t>(iii) Use and Applications</t> 

           <t>The use and applications description is intended to assist the "user"
              to understand how, when and where the metric can be applied, and what
              significance the value range for the metric may have. This MAY
              include a definition of the "typical" and "abnormal" range of the
              Performance Metric, if this was not apparent from the nature of the metric.
		  The description MAY include information about the influence of extreme 
              measurement values, i.e. if the Performance Metric is sensitive to
              outliers. The Use and Application section SHOULD also include the 
              security implications in the description.
           </t>
   
           <t>For example: </t>

             <t>(a) it is fairly intuitive that a lower packet loss ratio
                 would equate to better performance. However the user may
                 not know the significance of some given packet loss ratio,</t>
 
             <t>(b) the speech level of a telephone signal is commonly expressed
                 in dBm0. If the user is presented with:</t>

                  <t>Speech level = -7 dBm0 </t>

            <t>this is not intuitively understandable, unless the user is a
               telephony expert. If the metric definition explains that the
               typical range is -18 to -28 dBm0, a value higher than -18
               means the signal may be too high (loud) and less than -28
               means that the signal may be too low (quiet), it is much
               easier to interpret the metric. </t>

  		   <t>(iv) Reporting Model</t>

           <t>The reporting model definition is intended to make any relationship
              between the metric and the reporting model clear. There are often
              implied relationships between the method of reporting metrics and the
              metric itself, however these are often not made apparent to the
              implementor. For example, if the metric is a short term running average 
              packet delay variation (e.g. <xref target="RFC3550">
              RFC 3550</xref>) and this value is reported at intervals of 6-10 seconds, 
              the resulting measurement may have limited accuracy when packet delay variation 
              is non-stationary.</t>

        <section title="Example: Burst Packet Loss Frequency">
             
             <t>The burst packet loss frequency can be observed at different 
             layers. The following example is specific to RTP <xref target="RFC3550">
             RFC 3550</xref>.</t>
             
             <t>Metric Name: BurstPacketLossFrequency</t>

             <t>Metric Description: A burst of packet loss is defined as a longest
             period starting and ending with lost packets during which no more
             than Gmin consecutive packets are received. The
             BurstPacketLossFrequency is defined as the number of bursts of packet
             loss occurring during a specified time interval (e.g. per minute, per
             hour, per day). If Gmin is set to 0 then a burst of packet loss
             would comprise only consecutive lost packets, whereas a Gmin of 16
             would define bursts as periods of both lost and received packets
             (sparse bursts) having a loss rate of greater than 5.9%.</t>
 
             <t>Method: Bursts may be detected using the Markov Model
             algorithm defined in <xref target="RFC3611">RFC 3611</xref>. The 
             BurstPacketLossFrequency is calculated by counting the number of burst 
             events within the defined measurement interval. A burst that spans the 
             boundary between two time intervals shall be counted within the later of 
             the two intervals.</t>

             <t>Units of Measurement: Bursts per time interval (e.g. per second, per
             hour, per day)</t>

             <t>Measurement Timing: This metric can be used over a wide range of time
             intervals. Using time intervals of longer than one hour may prevent
             the detection of variations in the value of this metric due to time-
             of-day changes in network load. Timing intervals should not vary
             in duration by more than +/- 2%.</t>

             <t>Implementation Guidelines: See <xref target="RFC3611">RFC 3611</xref>.</t>

             <t>Verification Testing: See Appendix for C code to generate test
             vectors.</t>

             <t>Use and Applications: This metric is useful to detect IP network
             transients that affect the performance of applications such as
             Voice over IP or IP Video. The value of Gmin may be selected to
             ensure that bursts correspond to a packet loss ratio that would
             degrade the performance of the application of interest (e.g. 16 for
             VoIP).</t>

             <t>Reporting Model: This metric needs to be associated with a defined
             time interval, which could be defined by fixed intervals or by a
             sliding window.</t>

      <section title="Dependencies">
        
         <section title="Timing accuracy">
           <t>The accuracy of the timing of a measurement may affect the accuracy
              of the Performance Metric. This may not materially affect a sampled value metric
              however would affect an interval based metric. Some metrics, for
              example the number of events per time interval, would be directly
              affected; for example a 10% variation in time interval would
              lead directly to a 10% variation in the measured value. Other
              metrics, such as the average packet loss ratio during some time
              interval, would be affected to a lesser extent.
           </t>

           <t>If it is necessary to correlate sampled values or intervals then it
              is essential that the accuracy of sampling time and interval start/
              stop times is sufficient for the application (for example +/- 2%).
           </t>

         <section title="Dependencies of Performance Metric definitions on related events or metrics">
           <t>Performance Metric definitions may explicitly or implicitly rely on factors that
              may not be obvious. For example, the recognition of a packet as
              being "lost" relies on having some method to know the packet was
              actually lost (e.g. RTP sequence number), and some time threshold
              after which a non-received packet is declared as lost. It is
              important that any such dependencies are recognized and incorporated
              into the metric definition.

         <section title="Relationship between Performance Metric and lower layer
        Performance Metrics">
           <t>Lower layer Performance Metrics may be used to compute or infer the performance
              of higher layer applications, potentially using an application
              performance model. The accuracy of this will depend on many factors
              including:
           </t>
           
           <t>
              (i) The completeness of the set of metrics - i.e. are there metrics
              for all the input values to the application performance model?
           </t>
           
           <t>

           proxy, network address translation (NAT), redirect server, session border 
           controller (SBC), and application layer gateway (ALG) may add variability 
           to or restrict the 
scope of measurements of a metric.  For example, an SBC

      <section title="Organization of Results">
        <t>The IPPM Framework [RFC2330] organizes the results of metrics into 
        three related notions:</t>

          <t>sample, a set of singletons with some common properties and some

          <t>statistic, a value derived from a sample through deterministic 
    		calculation, such as the mean.</t>
        </list></t>
        
        <t>Many Performance Metrics MAY use this organization for the results, with or
        without the term names used by IPPM WG.  Section 11 of

      </section>  
      
     <section title="Parameters, the variables of a Performance Metric">
        <t>Metrics are completely defined when all options and input variables 
        have been identified and considered.  These variables are sometimes 
        left unspecified in a metric definition, and their general name 
        indicates that the user must set them and report them with the 
        results.  Such variables are called "parameters" in the IPPM metric 
        template.  The scope of the metric, the time at which it was 
        conducted, the settings for timers and the thresholds for counters 
        are all examples of parameters.</t>

        target="RFC2418"></xref>.
		The following entry criteria will be considered for each
        proposal.</t>

        <t>Proposals SHOULD be prepared as Internet Drafts, describing the
        Performance Metric and conforming to the qualifications above as much as
        possible.  Proposals SHOULD be deliverables of the corresponding protocol 
        development WG charters. As such, the Proposals SHOULD be vetted by that 
        WG prior to discussion by the Performance Metrics Entity.  This
        aspect of the process includes an assessment of the need for the
        Performance Metric proposed and assessment of the support for their
        development in IETF.
        </t>

        <t>Proposals SHOULD include an assessment of interaction and/or overlap
        with work in other Standards Development Organizations.  Proposals SHOULD 
        identify additional expertise that might be consulted.
        </t>

        <t>Proposals SHOULD specify the intended audience and users of the
        Performance Metrics. The development process encourages participation by members
        of the intended audience.</t>
        
        <t>Proposals SHOULD identify any security and IANA requirements.
       Security issues could potentially involve revealing of user
       identifying data or the potential misuse of active test tools. IANA

        key RFC authors and former chairs, or from the WG mailing list if it
        was not closed.</t>

        <t>A formal review is RECOMMENDED by the time the document is reviewed by the Area
        Directors, or an IETF Last Call is being conducted - same as expert reviews are being

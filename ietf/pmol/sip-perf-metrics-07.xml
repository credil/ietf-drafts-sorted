    <note title="Abstract">
      <t>This document defines a set of metrics and their usage to evaluate
      the performance of end-to-end Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for
      telephony services in both production and testing environments. The purpose of
      this document is to combine a standard set of common metrics, allowing
      interoperable performance measurements, easing the comparison of
      industry implementations.</t>
    </note>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction and Scope">
      <t>SIP has become a widely-used standard among many service providers,
      vendors, and end users in the telecommunications industry. Although there
      are many different standards for measuring the performance of telephony 
      signaling protocols, such as SS7, none of the metrics specifically address SIP.</t>

      <t>The scope of this document is limited to the definitions of a
      standard set of metrics for measuring and reporting SIP performance from
      an end-to-end perspective in a telephony environment. The metrics introduce
      a common foundation for understanding and quantifying performance expectations
      between service providers, vendors, and the users of services based on SIP.
      The intended audience for this document can be found among network operators, who
      often collect information on the responsiveness of the network to
      customer requests for services.</t>

      <t>Measurements of the metrics described in this document are affected
      by variables external to SIP. The following is a non-exhaustive list of
      examples:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Network connectivity</t>

          <t>Switch and router performance</t>

          <t>Server processes and hardware performance</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This document defines a list of pertinent metrics for varying aspects of a
      telephony environment.  They may be used individually or as a set based on the
      usage of SIP within the context of a given telecommunications service.</t>

      <t>The metrics defined in this document DO NOT take into consideration
      the impairment or failure of actual application processing of a request
      or response. The metrics do not distinguish application processing time
      from other sources of delay, such as packet transfer delay.</t>

      <t>Metrics designed to quantify single device application processing
      performance are beyond the scope of this document.</t>

      <t>This document does not provide any numerical objectives or acceptance
      threshold values for the SIP performance metrics defined below, as these
      items are beyond the scope of IETF activities, in general.</t>

      <t>The metrics defined in this document are applicable in scenarios
      where the SIP messages launched (into a network under test) are
      dedicated messages for testing purposes, or where the messages are
      user-initiated and a portion of the live traffic present. These two
      scenarios are sometimes referred to as active and passive measurement,
      respectively.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The following terms and conventions will be used throughout this
      document:</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

      <t>End-to-End - This is described as two or more elements utilized for
      initiating a request, receiving the request, and responding to the
      request. It encompasses elements as necessary to be involved in a
      session dialog between the originating user agent client (UAC),
      destination user agent server (UAS), and any interim proxies (may also
      include back-to-back user agent's (B2BUA's)). This may be relative to a
      single operator's set of elements or extend to encompass all elements
      (if beyond a single operator's network) associated with a session.</t>

      <t>Session - As described in <xref target="RFC3261">RFC 3261</xref>, SIP
      is used primarily to request, create, and conclude sessions. "These
      sessions include Internet telephone calls, multimedia distribution, and
      multimedia conferences." The metrics within this document measure the
      performance associated with the SIP dialogs necessary to establish these
      sessions; therefore, they are titled as: Session Request Delay, Session
      Disconnect Delay, etc. Although the titles of many of the metrics
      include this term, they are specifically measuring the signaling aspects
      only. Each session is identified by a unique Call-ID, "To" and
      "From" header field tag.</t>

      <t>Session Establishment - Session establishment occurs when a 200 OK
      response from the target UA has been received, in response to the originating
      UA's INVITE setup request, indicating the session setup request was
      successful.</t>

      <t>Session Setup - As referenced within the sub-sections of 4.2 in this
      document, session setup is the set of messages and included parameters
      directly related to the process of a UA requesting to establish a
      session with a corresponding UA. This is also described as a set of
      steps in order to establish "ringing" <xref
      target="RFC3261"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Time Interval Measurement and Reporting">
      <t>Many of the metrics defined in this memo utilize a clock to assess
      the time interval between two events. This section defines time- related
      terms and reporting requirements.</t>

      <t>t1 - start time</t>

      <t>This is the time instant (when a request is sent) that begins a
      continuous time interval. T1 occurs when the designated request has been
      processed by the SIP application and the first bit of the request packet
      has been sent from the UA or proxy (and is externally observable at some
      logical or physical interface).</t>

      <t>T1 represents the time at which each request-response test begins,
      and SHALL be used to designate the time-of-day when a particular
      measurement was conducted (e.g., The Session Request Delay at "t1" and
      (some specific UA interface) was measured to be X ms.)</t>

      <t>t4 - end time</t>

      <t>This is the time instant that concludes the continuous time interval
      begun when the related request is sent. t4 occurs when the last bit of
      the designated response is received by the SIP application at the
      requesting device (and is externally observable at some logical or
      physical interface).</t>

      <t>Note: The designations t2 and t3 are reserved for future use at
      another interface involved in satisfying a request.</t>

      <t>Section 10.1 of <xref target="RFC2330"></xref> describes
      time-related issues in measurements, and defines the errors that can be
      attributed to the clock themselves. These definitions are used in the
      material below.</t>

      <t>Time of Day Accuracy</t>

      <t>As defined above, t1 is associated with the start of a request and
      also serves as the time-of-day stamp associated with a single specific
      measurement. The clock offset <xref target="RFC2330"></xref> is the
      difference between t1 and a recognized primary source of time, such as
      UTC (offset = t1 - UTC).</t>

      <t>When measurement results will be correlated with other results or
      information using time-of-day stamps, then the time clock that supplies
      t1 SHOULD be synchronized to a primary time source, to minimize the
      clock's offset. The clocks used at the different measurement points
      SHOULD be synchronized to each other, to minimize the relative offset
      (as defined in RFC2330). The clock's offset and the relative offset MUST
      be reported with each measurement.</t>

      <t>Time Interval Accuracy</t>

      <t>The accuracy of the t4-t1 interval is also critical to maintain and
      report. The difference between a clock's offsets at t1 and t4 is one
      source of error for the measurement and is associated with the clock's
      skew <xref target="RFC2330"></xref>.</t>

      <t>A stable and reasonably accurate clock is needed to make the time
      interval measurements required by this memo. This source of error SHOULD
      be constrained to less than +/- 1 ms, implying 1 part per 1000 frequency
      accuracy for a 1 second interval. This implies greater stability is
      required as the length of the t4-t1 increases, in order to constrain the
      error to be less than +/- 1ms.</t>

      <t>There are several other important aspects of clock operation:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Synchronization protocols require some ability to make
          adjustments to the local clock. However, these adjustments (clock
          steps or slewing) can cause large errors if they occur during the t1
          to t4 measurement interval. Clock correction SHOULD be suspended
          during a t1 to t4 measurement interval, unless the time interval
          accuracy requirement above will be met. Alternatively, a measurement
          SHOULD NOT be performed during clock correction, unless the time
          interval accuracy requirement above will be met.</t>

          <t>If a free-running clock is used to make the time interval
          measurement, then the time of day reported with the measurement
          (which is normally timestamp t1) SHOULD be derived from a different
          clock that meets the time of day accuracy requirements described
          above.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The physical operation of reading time from a clock may be
      constrained by the delay to service the interrupt. Therefore, if the
      accuracy of the time stamp read at t1 or t4 includes the interrupt
      delay, this source of error SHOULD be known and included in the error
      assessment.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="SIP Performance Metrics">
      <t>In regards to all of the following metrics, t1 begins with the first
      associated SIP message sent by either UA, and is not reset if the
      UA must retransmit the same message, within the same transaction,
      multiple times. The first associated SIP message indicates the t1
      associated with the user or application expectation relative to the
      request.</t>

      <t>Some metrics are calculated using messages from different transactions
       in order to measure across actions such as redirection and failure recovery.
       The end time is typically based on a successful end-to-end provisional response,
       a successful final response, or a failure final response for which there is no
       recovery. The individual metrics detail which message to base the end time on.</t>
      
      <t>The authentication method used to establish the SIP dialog will change
      the message exchanges.  The example message exchanges used do not attempt to
      describe all of the various authentication types.  Since, authentication is
      frequently used, SIP Digest authentication was used for example purposes.
      </t>

      <t>In regards to all of the metrics, the accuracy and granularity of the
      output values are related to the accuracy and granularity of the input
      values.  Some of the metrics below are defined by a ratio. When the denominator of this
      ratio is 0, the metric is undefined. </t>
      
      <t>While these metrics do not specify the sample size.  This should be taken
      into consideration.  These metrics will provide a better indication of performance with
      larger sample sets.  For example, some SIP Service Providers (SSPs) <xref target="RFC5486"></xref> may choose to collect
      input over an hour, daily, weekly or monthly timeframe, while another SSP may choose to
      perform metric calculations over a varying set of SIP dialogs.  
      </t>
     
      <section title="Registration Request Delay (RRD)">
        <t>Registration Request Delay (RRD) is a measurement of the delay in
        responding to a UA REGISTER request. RRD SHALL be measured and
        reported only for successful REGISTER requests, while Ineffective
        Registration Attempts (Section 4.2) SHALL be reported for failures.
        This metric is measured at the originating UA. The output value of this metric is
        numerical and SHOULD be stated in units of milliseconds. The RRD is
        calculated using the following formula:</t>

        <t>RRD = Time of Final Response - Time of REGISTER Request</t>

        <t>In a successful registration attempt, RRD is defined as the time
        interval from the first bit of the initial REGISTER message containing
        the necessary information is passed by the originating UA to the
        intended registrar until the last bit of the 200 OK is received
        indicating the registration attempt has completed successfully. This
        dialog includes an expected authentication challenge prior to
        receiving the 200 OK as described in the following registration flow
        examples.</t>

        <t>The following message exchange provides an example of identifiable events
        necessary for inputs in calculating RRD during a successful
        registration completion:</t>

        </figure>
        
        <t>Note: Networks with elements using primarily Digest authentication will exhibit
      different RRD characteristics than networks with elements primarily using
      other authentication mechanisms (such as Identity). Operators monitoring
      RRD in networks with a mixture of authentications schemes should take note
      that the RRD measurements will likely have a multimodal distribution.
        </t>
        
      </section>

      <section title="Ineffective Registration Attempts (IRA)">
        <t>Ineffective registration attempts are utilized to detect failures
        or impairments causing an inability for a registrar to receive a UA
        REGISTER request. This metric is measured at the originating UA. The output value
        of this metric is numerical and SHOULD be reported as a percentage of
        registration attempts.</t>

        <t>This metric is calculated as a percentage of total REGISTER
        requests. The IRA is calculated using the following formula:</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
    
                     # of IRA  
   IRA % = ----------------------------- x 100 
            Total # of REGISTER Requests
     
     ]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>A failed registration attempt is defined as a final failure
        response to the initial REGISTER request. It usually indicates a
        failure received from the destination registrar, interim proxies, or
        due to a timeout of the REGISTER request at the originating UA. A
        failure response is described as a 4XX (excluding 401, 402, and 407
        non- failure challenge response codes), 5XX, or possible 6XX message.
        A timeout failure is identified by the timer F expiring. IRA may be
        used to detect problems in downstream signaling functions, which may
        be impairing the REGISTER message from reaching the intended
        registrar; or, it may indicate a registrar has become overloaded and
        is unable to respond to the request.</t>

        <t>The following message exchange provides a timeout example of an identifiable
        event necessary for input as a failed registration attempt:</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
     
               UA1                Registrar

                |REGISTER              | 
                |--------------------->| 
                |REGISTER              |

     ]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>In the previous message exchange UA1 retries a REGISTER request
        multiple times before the timer, indicating the failure, expires. Only
        the first REGISTER request MUST used for input to the calculation and
        an IRA. Subsequent REGISTER retries are identified by the same transaction
        identifier (same topmost Via header field branch parameter value)
        and MUST be ignored for purposes of metric calculation. This ensures
        an accurate representation of the metric output.</t>

        <t>The following message exchange provides a registrar servicing failure example
        of an identifiable event necessary for input as a failed registration
        attempt:</t>

      <section title="Session Request Delay (SRD)">
        <t>Session Request Delay (SRD) is utilized to detect failures or impairments
        causing delays in responding to a UA session request. SRD is measured
        for both successful and failed session setup requests as this metric
        usually relates to a user experience; however, SRD for session
        requests ending in a failure MUST NOT be combined in the same result
        with successful requests. The duration associated with success and
        failure responses will likely vary substantially, and the desired
        output time associated with each will be significantly different in
        many cases. This metric is similar to Post-Selection Delay defined in <xref
        target="E.721"></xref>, and it is measured at the originating UA only. The output
        value of this metric MUST indicate whether the output is for
        successful or failed session requests and SHOULD be stated in units of
        seconds. The SRD is calculated using the following formula:</t>

        <t>SRD = Time of Status Indicative Response - Time of INVITE</t>

        <section title="Successful Session Setup SRD">
          <t>In a successful request attempt, SRD is defined as the time
          interval from the first bit of the initial INVITE message containing
          the necessary information is sent by the originating user agent
          to the intended mediation or destination agent until the last bit of
          the first provisional response is received indicating an audible or
          visual status of the initial session setup request. (Note: In some
          cases, the initial INVITE may be forked.  Section 5.4 provides
          information for consideration on forking.)  In SIP, the
          message indicating status would be a non-100 Trying provisional
          message received in response to an INVITE request. In some cases, a
          non-100 Trying provisional message is not received, but rather a 200
          message is received as the first status message instead. In these
          situations, the 200 message would be used to calculate the
          interval.  In most circumstances, this metric relies on receiving a non-100 Trying
          message.  The use of PRACK <xref target="RFC3262"></xref> MAY improve the
          quality and consistency of the results.</t>

        <section title="Failed Session Setup SRD">
          <t>In a failed request attempt, SRD is defined as the time interval
          from the first bit of the initial INVITE message containing the
          necessary information sent by the originating agent or user to the
          intended mediation or destination agent until the last bit of the
          first provisional response or a failure indication response. A
          failure response is described as a 4XX (excluding 401, 402, and 407
          non-failure challenge response codes), 5XX, or possible 6XX message.
          A change in the metric output might indicate problems in downstream signaling
          functions, which may be impairing the INVITE message from reaching
          the intended UA or may indicate changes in end-point behavior. While
          this metric calculates the delay associated with a failed session request,
          the metric Ineffective Session Attempts (Section 4.10) is used for calculating
          a ratio of session attempt failures.</t>

      <section title="Session Disconnect Delay (SDD)">
      <t>This metric is utilized to detect failures or impairments delaying
        the time necessary to end a session. SDD is measured for both successful
        and failed session disconnects; however, SDD for session disconnects
        ending in a failure MUST NOT be combined in the same result with successful
        disconnects.  The duration associated with success and failure results
        will likely vary substantially, and the desired output time associated with
        each will be significantly different in many cases. It can be measured from either end-point UAs
        involved in the SIP dialog.  The output value of this metric is
        numerical and SHOULD be stated in units of milliseconds. The SDD is
        calculated using the following formula:</t>

        <t>SDD = Time of 2XX or Timeout - Time of Completion Message (BYE)</t>

        <t>SDD is defined as the interval between the first bit of the sent session completion
          message, such as a BYE, and the last bit of the subsequently
          received 2XX response. In some cases a recoverable error response,
          such as a 503 retry-after, may be received. In such situations, these responses
          should not be used as the end time for this metric calculation.  Instead the successful (2XX)
          response related to the recovery message is used.  The following
          message exchanges provide an example of identifiable events necessary for
          inputs in calculating SDD during a successful session completion:</t>

          <t>In some cases, no response is received after a session completion
          message is sent and potentially retried. In this case, the

      <section title="Session Duration Time (SDT)">
        <t>This metric is used to detect problems (e.g. poor audio quality)
        causing short session durations. SDT is measured for both successful
        and failed session completions. It can be measured from either end-point UAs
        involved in the SIP dialog. This metric is similar to Call Hold Time, and it is
        traditionally calculated as Average Call Hold Time (ACHT) in telephony
        applications of SIP. The output value of this metric is numerical and
        SHOULD be stated in units of seconds. The SDT is calculated using the
        following formula:</t>

        <t>SDT = Time of BYE or Timeout - Time of 200 OK response to
        INVITE</t>
        
        <t>This metric does not calculate the duration of sessions leveraging early media.
        For example, some automated response systems only use early media by responding with a
        SIP 183 Session in Progress message with SDP connecting the originating UA with the 
        the automated message.  Usually, in these sessions the originating UA never receives a 200 OK,
        and the message exchange ends with the originating UA sending a CANCEL.
        </t>

        <section title="Successful session duration SDT">
          <t>In a successful session completion, SDT is calculated as an
          average and is defined as the duration of a dialog defined by the
          interval from receipt of the first bit of a 200 OK response to an
          INVITE and receipt of the last bit of an associated BYE message
          indicating dialog completion. Retransmissions of the 200 OK and ACK messages
          due to network impairments do not reset the metric timers.</t>

      <section title="Session Establishment Effectiveness Ratio (SEER)">
        <t>This metric is complimentary to SER, but is intended to exclude the
        potential effects of an individual user of the target UA from the metric. SER is
        defined as the number of INVITE requests resulting in a 200 OK
        response and INVITE requests resulting in a 480, 486, 600 or 603; to the
        total number of attempted INVITE requests less INVITE requests
        resulting in a 3XX response. The response codes 480, 486, 600 and 603 were
        chosen, because they clearly indicate the effect of an individual user of the UA.
        It is possible an individual user could cause a negative effect on the UA.  For example,
        they may have misconfigured the UA causing a response code not directly related to a
        SSP, but this cannot be easily
        determined from an intermediary B2BUA somewhere inbetween the originating and terminating UA.
        With this in consideration, response codes such as 401, 407 and 420 (not an exhaustive list)
        were not included in the numerator of the metric. This metric is similar to Network Effectiveness
        Ratio (NER) defined in <xref target="E.411"></xref>.  It is measured at the originating UA only. The
        output value of this metric is numerical and SHOULD be adjusted to
        indicate a percentage of successfully established sessions less common
        UAS failures.</t>

      <section title="Ineffective Session Attempts (ISA)">
        <t>Ineffective session attempts occur when a proxy or agent internally
        releases a setup request with a failed or overloaded condition. This
        metric is similar to Ineffective Machine Attempts (IMA) in telephony
        applications of SIP, and was adopted from Telcordia GR-512-CORE <xref
        target="GR-512"></xref>. The output value of this metric is numerical
        and SHOULD be adjusted to indicate a percentage of ineffective session
        attempts. The following failure responses provide a guideline for this
        criterion:</t>

            <t>504 Server Timeout</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>This set was derived in a similar manner as described in Section
        4.9, in addition 408 failure responses may indicate an overloaded
        state with a downstream element; however, there are situations other
        than overload, which may cause an increase in 408 responses.</t>

        <t>This metric is calculated as a percentage of total session setup

    <section title="Additional Considerations">
      
      <section title="Metric Correlations">
      <t>These metrics may be used to determine the performance of a domain
      and/or user. This would be to provide a metric relative to one or more
      dimensions. The following is an example subset of dimensions for providing
      further granularity per metric:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>To "user"</t>

          <t>From "user"</t>

          <t>Bi-direction "user"</t>

          <t>To "domain"</t>

          <t>From "domain"</t>

          <t>Bi-direction "domain"</t>
        </list></t>
       </section>
            
      <section title="Back-to-back User Agent (B2BUA)">
        <t>A B2BUA may impact the ability to collect these metrics with an
        end- to-end perspective. It is necessary to realize a B2BUA may act as
        an originating UAC and terminating UAS or it may act as a proxy. In
        some cases, it may be necessary to consider information collected from
        both sides of the B2BUA in order to determine the end-to-end
        perspective. In other cases, the B2BUA may act simply as a proxy
        allowing data to be derived as necessary for the input into any of the
        listed calculations.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Authorization and Authentication">
        <t>During the process of setting up a SIP dialog, various
        authentication methods may be utilized. These authentication methods
        will add to the duration as measured by the metrics, and the length of
        time will vary based on those methods. The failures of these
        authentication methods will also be captured by these metrics, since
        SIP is ultimately used to indicate the success or failure of the
        authorization and/or authentication attempt. The metrics in section 3
        are inclusive of the duration associated with this process, even if
        the method is external to the SIP protocol. This was included
        purposefully, due to its inherent impact on the protocol and the
        subsequent SIP dialogs.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Forking">
        <t>Forking SHOULD be considered when determining the messages
        associated with the input values for the described metrics. If all of
        the forked dialogs were used in the metric calculations, the numbers
        would skew dramatically. There are two different points of forking,
        which MUST be considered. First, forking may occur at a proxy
        downstream from the UA that is being used for metric input values.
        The downstream proxy is responsible for forking a message.  Then, this proxy
        will send provisional (e.g. 180) messages received from the requests and
        send the accepted (e.g. 200) response to the UA. Second, in the
        cases where the originating UA or proxy is forking the messages, then it
        MUST parse the message exchanges necessary for input into the metrics
        For example, it MAY utilize the first INVITE or set of INVITE messages sent and the
        first accepted 200 OK. Tags will identify this dialog as distinct
        from the other 200 OK responses, which are acknowledged and an
        immediate BYE is sent. The application responsible for capturing
        and/or understanding the input values MUST utilize these tags to
        distinguish between dialog requests.</t>
        
        <t>Note that if an INVITE is forked before reaching its destination, multiple
         early dialogs are likely and multiple confirmed dialogs are possible (though unlikely).
         When this occurs, an SRD measurement should be taken for each dialog that is created (early or confirmed). 
        </t>
        
      </section>

      <section title="Data Collection">
        <t>The input necessary for these calculations may be collected in a
        number of different manners. It may be collected or retrieved from
        call detail records (CDR) or raw signaling information generated by a
        proxy or UA. When using records, time synchronization MUST be
        considered between applicable elements.</t>

        <t>If these metrics are calculated at individual elements (such as proxies or endpoints) instead
      of by a centralized management system and the individual elements use different measurement sample
      sizes, then the metrics reported for the same event at those elements may differ significantly.
        </t>
        
        <t>The information may also be transmitted through the use of network
        management protocols like Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
        and via future extensions to the SIP Management Information Base (MIB)
        modules <xref target="RFC4780"></xref>, or through a potential
        undefined new performance metric event package <xref
        target="RFC3265"></xref> retrieved via SUBSCRIBE requests.</t>

        <t>Data may be collected for a sample of calls or all calls, and may
        also be derived from test call scenarios. These metrics are flexible
        based on the needs of the application.</t>
        
        <t>For consistency in calculation of the metrics, elements
        should expect to reveal event inputs for use by a centralized management
        system, which would calculate the metrics based on a varying set sample
        size of inputs received from elements compliant with this specification.
        </t>
        
      </section>

      <section title="Testing Documentation">
        <t>In some cases, these metrics will be used to provide output values
        to signify the performance level of a specific SIP-based element. When
        using these metrics in a test environment, the environment MUST be
        accurately documented for the purposes of replicating any output
        values in future testing and/or validation.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Conclusions">
      <t>This document provides a description of common performance
      metrics, and their defined use with SIP. The use of these metrics will
      provide a common viewpoint across all vendors, service providers, and
      users. These metrics will likely be utilized in production telephony SIP
      environments for providing input regarding Key Performance Indicators
      (KPI) and Service Level Agreement (SLA) indications; however, they may
      also be used for testing end-to-end SIP-based service environments.</t>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>There are no IANA considerations at this time.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Security should be considered in the aspect of securing the relative
      data utilized in providing input to the above calculations. All other
      aspects of security should be considered as described in <xref
      target="RFC3261">RFC 3261</xref>.</t>
      
      <t>Implementers of these metrics MUST realize that these metrics
       could be used to describe characteristics of customer and user usage patterns,
       and privacy should be considered when collecting, transporting and storing them.

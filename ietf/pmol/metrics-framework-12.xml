    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Many networking technologies, applications, or services, are distributed
      in nature, and their performance may be impacted by IP impairments, server 
      capacity, congestion and other factors. It is important to measure the 
      performance of applications and services to ensure that quality objectives 
      are being met and to support problem diagnosis. Standardized metrics help 
      to ensure that performance measurement is implemented consistently and facilitate 
      interpretation and comparison.</t>

      <t>There are at least three phases in the development of performance
      standards. They are:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Definition of a Performance Metric and its units of measure</t>

          <t>Specification of a method of measurement</t>

          <t>Specification of the reporting format</t>
        </list>
      During the development of metrics, it is often useful to define
      performance objectives and expected value ranges. However, this is not
      defined as part of the metric specification. </t>

     <t>
     The intended audience for this document includes, but is not
     limited to, IETF participants who write Performance Metrics documents
     in the IETF, reviewers of such documents, and members of the Performance
     Metrics Directorate. 
     </t>

		<section title="Background and Motivation">
			 <t>
                        Previous IETF work related to reporting of application Performance Metrics
                        includes the "Real-time Application Quality-of-Service Monitoring (RAQMON) Framework"
                        <xref target="RFC4710"></xref>, which extends the remote network monitoring
                        (RMON) family of specifications to allow real-time quality-of-service (QoS)
                        monitoring of various applications that run on devices such as IP phones,
                        pagers, Instant Messaging clients, mobile phones, and various other
                        handheld computing devices. Furthermore, the "RTP Control Protocol Extended
                        Reports (RTCP XR)" <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> and the "SIP RTCP Summary
                        Report Protocol" <xref target="RFC6035"></xref> are
                        protocols that support the real-time reporting of Voice over IP and other
                        applications running on devices such as IP phones and mobile handsets.
                  </t>

			<t>
				The IETF is also actively involved in the development of reliable
				transport protocols, such as <xref target="RFC0793">TCP</xref> or 
                        <xref target="RFC4960">SCTP</xref>, which would affect the relationship 
                        between IP performance and application performance.
			</t>

			<t>
				Thus there is a gap in the currently chartered coverage of IETF
				Working Groups (WG): development of Performance Metrics for protocols above 
                        and below the IP-layer that can be used to characterize performance on live 
                        networks.
			</t>

			<t>
                        Similarly to the "Guidelines for Considering Operations and Management of 
                        New Protocols and Protocol Extensions" <xref target="RFC5706"></xref>, which 
                        is the reference document for the IETF Operations Directorate, this document
                        should be consulted as part of the new Performance Metric review by the 
                        members of the Performance Metrics Directorate.

        <t>This document is divided in two major sections beyond the "Purpose and
        Scope" section. The first is a definition and description of a
        Performance Metric and its key aspects. The second defines a process
        to develop these metrics that is applicable to the IETF
        environment.</t>

		<section title="Performance Metrics Directorate">
			<t>
				The Performance Metrics Directorate is a directorate provides guidance 
                        for Performance Metrics development in the IETF.
			</t>
			<t>
				The Performance Metrics Directorate should be composed of experts in the performance community,
				potentially selected from the IPPM, BMWG, and PMOL WGs.
			</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Quality of Service">
			<t>
				Quality of Service (QoS) is defined similarly to the ITU
				"QoS experienced/perceived by customer/user (QoE)"
				<xref target="E.800">E.800</xref>, i.e.:
				"Totality of characteristics of a telecommunications service that bear
				on its ability to satisfy stated and implied needs of the user of the service."
			</t>

		</section>

		<section title="Quality of Experience">
			<t>
				Quality of Experience (QoE) is defined in a similar way to the ITU
				"QoS experienced/perceived by customer/user (QoE)"
				<xref target="E.800">E.800</xref>, i.e.:
				"a statement expressing the level of quality that customers/users believe
				they have experienced."
			</t>
			<t>
				NOTE 1 - The level of QoS experienced and/or perceived by the customer/user
				may be expressed by an opinion rating.
			</t>
			<t>
				NOTE 2 - QoE has two main components: quantitative and
                        qualitative. The quantitative component can be influenced by the
                        complete end-to-end system effects (including user devices and
                        network infrastructure).
			</t>
                  <t>
				NOTE 3 - The qualitative component can be influenced by user expectations, 
				ambient conditions, psychological factors, application context, etc.
			</t>
			<t>
				NOTE 4 - QoE may also be considered as QoS delivered, received, and 
				interpreted by a user with the pertinent qualitative factors influencing 
				his/her perception of the service.
			</t>
            </section>

		<section title="Performance Metric">
			<t>
				A quantitative measure of performance, specific to an IETF-specified 
                        protocol or specific to an application transported over an IETF-specified                     
                        protocol. Examples of Performance Metrics are: the FTP response time for a 
                        complete file download, the DNS response time to resolve the IP address, a 
                        database logging time, etc.
			</t>
            </section>
    </section>


    <section title="Purpose and Scope">
     
		<t>The purpose of this document is to define a framework and a process
		for developing Performance Metrics for protocols above and below the IP-layer 
		(such as IP-based applications that operate over reliable or datagram transport 
		protocols), that can be used to characterize traffic on live networks and 
		services. As such, this document does not define any Performance Metrics.</t>

		<t>The scope of this document covers guidelines for the Performance Metrics Directorate 
            members for considering new Performance Metrics, and suggests how the Performance Metrics 
            Directorate will interact with the rest of the IETF. However this document is not intended 
            to supersede existing working methods within WGs that have existing chartered work in 
            this area. </t>
		
		<t>This process is not intended to govern Performance Metric development
            in existing IETF WG that are focused on metrics development, such as
            IPPM and BMWG. However, this guidelines document may be useful in
            these activities, and MAY be applied where appropriate. A typical example 
            is the development of Performance Metrics to be exported with the IPFIX
            protocol <xref target="RFC5101">RFC 5101</xref>, with specific IPFIX information
            elements <xref target="RFC5102">RFC 5102</xref>, which would benefit from
           the framework in this document. </t>
      
           <t>The framework in this document applies to Performance Metrics derived from
           both active and passive measurements.</t>

    </section>
    
    <section title="Relationship between QoS, QoE and Application-specific Performance Metrics">
      <t> Network QoS deals with network and network protocol performance, while QoE
	  deals with the assessment of a user's experience in a context of a task or a
	  service. As a result, the topic of application-specific Performance Metrics includes the
	  measurement of performance at layers between IP and the user.
	  For example, network QoS metrics (packet loss, delay, and delay variation 
	  <xref target="RFC5481"></xref>) can be used to estimate application-specific
	  Performance Metrics (de-jitter buffer size and RTP-layer packet loss), then
        combined with other known aspects of a VoIP application (such as codec type)
	  to estimate a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) <xref target="P.800"></xref>. 	  
	  However, the QoE for a particular VoIP user depends on the specific context, 
	  such as a casual conversation, a business conference call, or an emergency call. 
        Finally, QoS and application-specific Performance Metrics are quantitative, while QoE is 
        qualitative. Also network QoS and application-specific Performance Metrics can be
	  directly or indirectly evident to the user, while the QoE is directly evident.</t>

    <section title="Performance Metrics Development">
      <t>This section provides key definitions and qualifications of
      Performance Metrics.</t>

      <section title="Identifying and Categorizing the Audience">
                
        <t>Many of the aspects of metric definition and reporting, even the 
        selection or determination of the essential metrics, depend on who 
        will use the results, and for what purpose. For example, the metric description 
        SHOULD include use cases and example reports that illustrate service quality 
        monitoring and maintenance or identification and quantification of problems.</t> 
        
        <t>All documents defining Performance Metrics SHOULD identify the primary
        audience and its associated requirements. The audience can influence
        both the definition of metrics and the methods of measurement.</t>
        
        <t>The key areas of variation between different metric users include:</t>
        
        <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Suitability of passive measurements of live traffic, or active 
          measurements using dedicated traffic</t>
       
          <t>Measurement in laboratory environment, or on a network of deployed
          devices</t>
       
          <t>Accuracy of the results</t>
       
          <t>Access to measurement points and configuration information</t>
          
          <t>Measurement topology (point-to-point, point-to-multipoint)</t>
                    
          <t>Scale of the measurement system</t>
                              
          <t>Measurements conducted on-demand, or continuously</t>
                                        
          <t>Required reporting formats and periods</t>

          <t>Sampling criteria, such systematic or probabilistic</t>

          <t>Period (and duration) of measurement, as the live traffic can have patterns</t>
                 
        </list></t>

      </section>
      
      <section title="Definitions of a Performance Metric">
        <t>A Performance Metric is a measure of an observable behavior of a networking technology, 
        an application, or a service. Most of the time, the Performance Metric can be 
        directly measured however, sometimes, the Performance Metric value is computed.
        The process for determining the value of a metric may assume some implicit or 
        explicit underlying statistical process, in this case, the Performance Metric is 
        an estimate of a parameter of this process, assuming that the statistical process 
        closely models the behavior of the system.</t>

        <t>A Performance Metric should serve some defined purpose. This may include the
        measurement of capacity, quantifying how bad some problem is,
        measurement of service level, problem diagnosis or location and other
        such uses. A Performance Metric may also be an input to some other process, for
        example the computation of a composite Performance Metric or a model or simulation
        of a system. Tests of the "usefulness" of a Performance Metric include:</t>

        <t><list style="empty">
            <t>(i) the degree to which its absence would cause significant
            loss of information on the behavior or performance of the application or
            system being measured</t>

            <t>(ii) the correlation between the Performance Metric, the QoS 
            <xref target="G.1000"></xref> and QoE delivered to the 
            user (person or other application)</t>
                        
            <t>(iii) the degree to which the Performance Metric is able to support the
            identification and location of problems affecting service
            quality.</t>
            
            <t>(iv) the requirement to develop policies (Service Level Agreement,
            and potentially Service Level Contract) based on the Performance Metric.</t>
            
          </list>For example, consider a distributed application operating
        over a network connection that is subject to packet loss. A Packet
        Loss Rate (PLR) Performance Metric is defined as the mean packet loss ratio over
        some time period. If the application performs poorly over network
        connections with high packet loss ratio and always performs well when
        the packet loss ratio is zero then the PLR Performance Metric is useful to some
        degree. Some applications are sensitive to short periods of high loss
        (bursty loss) and are relatively insensitive to isolated packet loss
        events; for this type of application there would be very weak
        correlation between PLR and application performance. A "better" Performance Metric
        would consider both the packet loss ratio and the distribution of loss
        events. If application performance is degraded when the PLR exceeds
        some rate then a useful Performance Metric may be a measure of the duration and
        frequency of periods during which the PLR exceeds that rate (as for example in RFC3611).</t>
        
      </section>

      <section title="Computed Performance Metrics">
        <section title="Composed Performance Metrics">
			
        <t>Some Performance Metrics may not be measured directly, but can be composed from
        base metrics that have been measured. A composed Performance Metric is derived from 
        other metrics by applying a deterministic process or function (e.g., 
        a composition function). The process may use metrics that are identical 
        to the metric being composed, or metrics that are dissimilar, or some 
        combination of both types. Usually the base metrics have a limited scope 
        in time or space, and they can be combined to estimate the performance 
        of some larger entities.</t>
        
        <t>Some examples of composed Performance Metrics and composed Performance Metric definitions 
        are:</t>

        <list> 
           <t>Spatial composition is defined as the composition of metrics of the
           same type with differing spatial domains 
           <xref target="RFC5835"></xref>  
           <xref target="RFC6049"></xref>. Ideally, for spatially
           composed metrics to be meaningful, the spatial domains should be non-overlapping 
	     and contiguous, and the composition operation should be mathematically appropriate 
	     for the type of metric.</t>

           <t>Temporal composition is defined as the composition of sets of metrics
           of the same type with differing time spans <xref target="RFC5835"></xref>. For temporally
           composed metrics to be meaningful, the time spans should be
           non-overlapping and contiguous, and the composition operation should
           be mathematically appropriate for the type of metric.</t>

           <t>Temporal aggregation is a summarization of metrics into a smaller
           number of metrics that relate to the total time span covered by the
           original metrics. An example would be to compute the minimum,
           maximum and average values of a series of time sampled values of a
           metric.</t>
        </list> 

	  <t>In the context of flow records in IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX), the IPFIX 
        Mediation: Framework <xref target="RFC6183"></xref> also discusses some 
	  aspects of the temporal and spatial composition. </t>

	  </section>
        
        <section title="Index">
        <t>An Index is a metric for which the output value range has been
        selected for convenience or clarity, and the behavior of which is
        selected to support ease of understanding; for example the R Factor 
        <xref target="G.107"></xref>. The deterministic function for an index 
        is often developed after the index range and behavior have been 
        determined.</t>

        </section>
        
      </section>

      <section title="Performance Metric Specification">
        <section title="Outline">

        <t>A Performance Metric definition MUST have a normative part that defines what
        the metric is and how it is measured or computed and SHOULD have an
        informative part that describes the Performance Metric and its application. </t>
 
       </section>

        <section title="Normative parts of Performance Metric definition">

        <t>The normative part of a Performance Metric definition MUST define at least the
        following: </t>

        <t>(i) Metric Name</t>
        
        <t> Performance Metric names are RECOMMENDED to be unique within the set of metrics being 
       defined for the protocol layer and context. While strict uniqueness may not be attainable 
       (See the IPPM registry <xref target="RFC6248"></xref> for an example of IANA metric registry 
       failing to provide sufficient specificity), broad review must be sought to avoid naming 
       overlap.  Note that the Performance Metrics Directorate can help with suggestions for IANA 
       metric registration for unique naming. The Performance Metric name MAY be descriptive.</t>

        <t> (ii) Metric Description</t>
        <t> The Performance Metric description MUST explain what the metric is, what is being	 		
	        measured and how this relates to the performance of the system being			
	        measured.</t>

        <t> (iii) Method of Measurement or Calculation</t>

        <t>
			The method of measurement or calculation MUST define what is being
			measured or computed and the specific algorithm to be used. Does the
			measurement involve active or only passive measurements? Terms such
			as "average" should be qualified (e.g. running average or average over
			some interval). Exception cases SHOULD also be defined with the
			appropriate handling method. For example, there are a number of commonly
			used metrics related to packet loss; these often don't define the criteria
			by which a packet is determined to be lost (vs very delayed) or how
			duplicate packets are handled. For example, if the average packet
			loss rate during a time interval is reported, and a packet's arrival
			is delayed from one interval to the next then was it "lost" during
			the interval during which it should have arrived or should it be
			counted as received?</t>

                  <t>Some methods of calculation might require discarding some data
                  collected (due to outliers) so as to make the measurement parameters
                  meaningful. One example is burstable billing that sorts the 5-min samples, 
                  and discard the top 5 percentile.</t> 
          
          <t>Some parameters linked to the method MAY also be reported, in 
          order to fully interpret the Performance Metric. For example, the 
          time interval, the load, the minimum packet loss, the potential measurement 
          errors and their sources, the attainable accuracy of the metric (e.g. +/-0,1),
          the method of caluclation, etc...</t>

        <t>(iv) Units of measurement </t>
        
        <t>The units of measurement MUST be clearly stated.</t>
        
        <t> (v) Measurement Point(s)</t>
         
        <t>If the measurement is specific to a measurement point, this SHOULD be
        defined. The measurement domain MAY also be defined. Specifically, if 
        measurement points are spread across domains, the measurement domain 
        (intra-, inter-) is another factor to consider.</t>

        <t>The Performance Metric definition should discuss how the Performance Metric value might 
        vary depending which measurement point is chosen. For example, the time between a SIP 
        request <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> and the final response can be significantly different 
        at the User Agent Client (UAC) or User Agent Server (UAS).</t>

        <t>In some cases, the measurement requires multiple measurement points: all measurement 
        points SHOULD be defined, including the measurement domain(s).</t>
         
        <t> (vi) Measurement timing</t>

        <t>The acceptable range of timing intervals or sampling intervals for a
           measurement and the timing accuracy required for such intervals MUST
           be specified. Short sampling intervals or frequent samples provide
           a rich source of information that can help to assess application
           performance but may lead to excessive measurement data. Long 
           measurement or sampling intervals reduce the amount of reported
           and collected data such that it may be insufficient to understand
           application performance or service quality insofar as the measured 
           quantity may vary significantly with time.</t>

	     <t>In case of multiple measurement points, the potential requirement
	     for synchronized clocks must be clearly specified. In the specific example
	      of the IP delay variation application metric, the different aspects of synchronized 
	      clocks are discussed in  <xref target="RFC5481"></xref>.</t>

        </section>

        <section title="Informative parts of Performance Metric definition"></section>

           <t>The informative part of a Performance Metric specification is intended to support
              the implementation and use of the metric. This part SHOULD provide
              the following data:</t> 

           <t>(i) Implementation </t>
        
           <t>The implementation description MAY be in the form of text, algorithm
              or example software. The objective of this part of the metric
              definition is to assist implementers to achieve consistent results.</t>

           <t>(ii) Verification</t>
      
           <t>The Performance Metric definition SHOULD provide guidance on verification
              testing. This may be in the form of test vectors, a formal
              verification test method or informal advice.</t>

           <t>(iii) Use and Applications</t> 

           <t>The use and applications description is intended to assist the "user"
              to understand how, when and where the metric can be applied, and what
              significance the value range for the metric may have. This MAY
              include a definition of the "typical" and "abnormal" range of the
              Performance Metric, if this was not apparent from the nature of the metric.
		  The description MAY include information about the influence of extreme 
              measurement values, i.e. if the Performance Metric is sensitive to
              outliers. The Use and Application section SHOULD also include the 
              security implications in the description.
           </t>
   
           <t>For example: </t>

             <t>(a) it is fairly intuitive that a lower packet loss ratio
                 would equate to better performance. However the user may
                 not know the significance of some given packet loss ratio,</t>
 
             <t>(b) the speech level of a telephone signal is commonly expressed
                 in dBm0. If the user is presented with:</t>

                  <t>Speech level = -7 dBm0 </t>

            <t>this is not intuitively understandable, unless the user is a
               telephony expert. If the metric definition explains that the
               typical range is -18 to -28 dBm0, a value higher than -18
               means the signal may be too high (loud) and less than -28
               means that the signal may be too low (quiet), it is much
               easier to interpret the metric. </t>

  		   <t>(iv) Reporting Model</t>

           <t>The reporting model definition is intended to make any relationship
              between the metric and the reporting model clear. There are often
              implied relationships between the method of reporting metrics and the
              metric itself, however these are often not made apparent to the
              implementor. For example, if the metric is a short term running average 
              packet delay variation (e.g. the interarrival jitter in <xref target="RFC3550">
              </xref>) and this value is reported at intervals of 6-10 seconds, 
              the resulting measurement may have limited accuracy when packet delay variation 
              is non-stationary.</t>

        <section title="Example: Loss Rate">
             
             <t>The example used is the loss rate metric as specified in <xref target="RFC3611"> RFC 3611</xref>.</t>
             
             <t>Metric Name: LossRate</t>

             <t>Metric Description: The fraction of RTP data packets from the source 
             lost since the beginning of reception.</t>
 
             <t>Method of measurement or calculation: This value is
             calculated by dividing the total number of packets lost (after
             the effects of applying any error protection such as FEC) by
             the total number of packets expected, multiplying the result of
             the division by 256, limiting the maximum value to 255 (to
             avoid overflow), and taking the integer part.</t>

             <t>Units of Measurement: This metric is expressed as a fixed point number 
             with the binary point at the left edge of the field. For example, a metric 
             value of 12 means a loss rate of approximately 5%.</t>

             <t>Measurement Point(s): This metric is made at the receiving end of 
               the RTP stream sent during a Voice over IP call.</t>

             <t>Measurement Timing: This metric can be used over a wide range of time
             intervals. Using time intervals of longer than one hour may prevent
             the detection of variations in the value of this metric due to time-
             of-day changes in network load. Timing intervals should not vary
             in duration by more than +/- 2%.</t>

             <t>Implementation: The numbers of duplicated packets and discarded packets do 
             not enter into this calculation.  Since receivers cannot be required to 
             maintain unlimited buffers, a receiver MAY categorize late-arriving
             packets as lost.  The degree of lateness that triggers a loss SHOULD be 
             significantly greater than that which triggers a discard.</t>

             <t>Verification: The metric value ranges between 0 and 255.</t>

             <t>Use and Applications: This metric is useful for monitoring VoIP calls. More 
             precisely, to detect the VoIP loss rate in the network. This loss rate, along 
             with the rate of packets discarded due to jitter, has some effect on the quality 
             of the voice stream.</t>

             <t>Reporting Model: This metric needs to be associated with a defined
             time interval, which could be defined by fixed intervals or by a
             sliding window. In the context of RFC3611 the metric is measured continuously from the
             start of the RTP stream, the value of the metric is sampled and reported in RTCP
             XR VoIP Metrics reports</t>

      <section title="Dependencies">

           <t>This section introduces several Performance Metrics dependencies, which the 
           Performance Metric designer should keep in mind during the Performance Metric 
           development. These dependencies, and any others not listed here, SHOULD be documented in 
           the Performance Metric specifications.    
           </t>
        
         <section title="Timing accuracy">
           <t>The accuracy of the timing of a measurement may affect the accuracy
              of the Performance Metric. This may not materially affect a sampled value metric
              however would affect an interval based metric. Some metrics, for
              example the number of events per time interval, would be directly
              affected; for example a 10% variation in time interval would
              lead directly to a 10% variation in the measured value. Other
              metrics, such as the average packet loss ratio during some time
              interval, would be affected to a lesser extent.
           </t>

           <t>If it is necessary to correlate sampled values or intervals then it
              is essential that the accuracy of sampling time and interval start/
              stop times is sufficient for the application (for example +/- 2%).
           </t>

         </section>
         
         <section title="Dependencies of Performance Metric definitions on related events or metrics">
           <t>Performance Metric definitions may explicitly or implicitly rely on factors that
              may not be obvious. For example, the recognition of a packet as
              being "lost" relies on having some method to know the packet was
              actually lost (e.g. RTP sequence number), and some time threshold
              after which a non-received packet is declared as lost. It is
              important that any such dependencies are recognized and incorporated
              into the metric definition.

         <section title="Relationship between Performance Metric and lower layer
        Performance Metrics">
           <t>Lower layer Performance Metrics may be used to compute or infer the performance
              of higher layer applications, potentially using an application
              performance model. The accuracy of this will depend on many factors
              including:
           </t>
           
           <t>
              (i) The completeness of the set of metrics - i.e. are there metrics
              for all the input values to the application performance model?
           </t>
           
           <t>
             (ii) Correlation between input variables (being measured) and
             application performance
           </t>

           <t>
            (iii) Variability in the measured metrics and how this variability
             affects application performance
           </t>
         </section>  
         
         <section title="Middlebox presence">
           <t>Presence of a middlebox <xref target="RFC3303"></xref>, e.g., 
           proxy, network address translation (NAT), redirect server, session border 
           controller (SBC, <xref target="RFC5853"></xref>), and application layer gateway (ALG) may add variability 
           to or restrict the scope of measurements of a metric. For example, an SBC 
           that does not process RTP loopback packets may block or locally terminate 
           this traffic rather then pass it through to its target.</t>
         </section>  
         
      </section>
      
      <section title="Organization of Results">
        <t>The IPPM Framework [RFC2330] organizes the results of metrics into 
        three related notions:</t>
    		
        <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>singleton, an elementary instance, or "atomic" value.</t>

          <t>sample, a set of singletons with some common properties and some 
    		varying properties.</t>

          <t>statistic, a value derived from a sample through deterministic 
    		calculation, such as the mean.</t>
        </list></t>
        
        <t>Performance Metrics MAY use this organization for the results, with or
        without the term names used by IPPM WG. Section 11 of
        <xref target="RFC2330">RFC 2330</xref> should consulted for further details.</t>
     
      </section>  
      
     <section title="Parameters, the variables of a Performance Metric">
        <t>Metrics are completely defined when all options and input variables 
        have been identified and considered. These variables are sometimes 
        left unspecified in a metric definition, and their general name 
        indicates that the user must set them and report them with the 
        results. Such variables are called "parameters" in the IPPM metric 
        template. The scope of the metric, the time at which it was 
        conducted, the length interval of the sliding window measurement, 
        the settings for timers and the thresholds for counters 
        are all examples of parameters.</t>
        
        <t>All documents defining Performance Metric SHOULD identify all key 
        parameters for each Performance Metric.</t>

        processes for adopting new work as described in RFC 2026 <xref
        target="RFC2026"></xref> and RFC 2418 <xref target="RFC2418"></xref>. 
        Note that new Performance Metrics work item proposals SHALL be 
        approved using the existing IETF process. The following entry criteria will be considered 
        for each proposal.</t>

        <t>Proposals SHOULD be prepared as Internet Drafts, describing the
        Performance Metric and conforming to the qualifications above as much as
        possible. Proposals SHOULD be deliverables of the corresponding protocol 
        development WG charters. As such, the Proposals SHOULD be vetted by that 
        WG prior to discussion by the Performance Metrics Directorate. This
        aspect of the process includes an assessment of the need for the
        Performance Metric proposed and assessment of the support for their
        development in IETF.
        </t>

        <t>Proposals SHOULD include an assessment of interaction and/or overlap
        with work in other Standards Development Organizations. Proposals SHOULD 
        identify additional expertise that might be consulted.
        </t>

        <t>Proposals SHOULD specify the intended audience and users of the
        Performance Metrics. The development process encourages participation by members
        of the intended audience.</t>
        
        <t>Proposals SHOULD identify any security and IANA requirements.
       Security issues could potentially involve revealing of user
       identifying data or the potential misuse of active test tools. IANA
       considerations may involve the need for a Performance Metrics registry.</t>

      <section title="Reviewing Metrics">
   
           <t>Each Performance Metric SHOULD be assessed according to the following list of

           <list style="symbols">
              <t>Are the performance metrics unambiguously defined?</t>
              <t>Are the units of measure specified?</t>

              <t>Are significant sources of measurement errors identified and discussed?</t>
              <t>Does the method of measurement ensure that results are repeatable?</t>
              <t>Do the metric or method of measurement appear to be implement-able,
                (or offer evidence of working implementation)?</t>
              <t>Are there any undocumented assumptions concerning the underlying
                 process that would affect an implementation or interpretation
                 of the metric?</t>
              <t>Can the metric results related to application performance or user
                 experience, when such a relationship is of value?</t>
              <t>Relationship to metrics defined elsewhere within IETF or within
                 other SDO's</t>
              <t>Do the Security Considerations adequately address denial of service
                 attacks, unwanted interference with the metric/measurement, and
                 user data confidentiality (when measuring live traffic)?</t>

      <section title="Performance Metrics Directorate Interaction with other WGs">
        <t>The Performance Metrics Directorate SHALL provide guidance to the related 
        protocol development WG when considering an Internet Draft that specifies 
        Performance Metrics for a protocol. A sufficient number of individuals
        with expertise must be willing to consult on the draft. If the related
        WG has concluded, comments on the proposal should still be sought from
        key RFC authors and former chairs.</t>

        <t>A formal review is recommended by the time the document is reviewed by the Area
        Directors, or an IETF Last Call is being conducted - same as expert reviews are being 
        performed by other directorates.</t>

        <t>Existing mailing lists SHOULD be used, however a dedicated mailing
        list MAY be initiated if necessary to facilitate work on a draft.</t>

        <t>In some cases, it will be appropriate to have the IETF session
        discussion during the related protocol WG session, to maximize
        visibility of the effort to that WG and expand the review.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Standards Track Performance Metrics">
        <t>
        The Performance Metrics Directorate will assist with the progression of RFCs 
        along the Standards Track. See <xref target="I-D.bradner-metricstest"></xref>.
        This may include the preparation of test plans to examine different
        implementations of the metrics to ensure that the metric definitions
        are clear and unambiguous (depending on the final form of the draft
        above).

   Prefix Pool Option for DHCPv6 Relay Agent on Provider Edge Router
                draft-yeh-dhc-dhcpv6-prefix-pool-opt-04

Abstract

   The Prefix Pool option provides an automatic mechanism based on the
   DHCPv6-PD, allowing the DHCPv6 server to notify the DHCPv6 relay
   agent implemented only on the Provider Edge (PE) router about the
   information of prefix pools.  The information of prefix pools can be
   used to enforce IPv6 route aggregation on the PE router by adding or
   removing the aggregated routes per the status of the prefix pools.
   The advertising of the aggregated routes in the routing protocol
   enabled on the network-facing interface of PE router will
   dramatically decreases the number of the routes entries in the ISP
   network.

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Prefix Pool Option              June 2011


1.  Introduction

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] protocol specifies a mechanism for the assignment of
   IPv6 address and configuration information to IPv6 nodes.  DHCPv6
   Prefix Delegation (DHCPv6-PD) [RFC3633] specifies a mechanism for the
   delegation of IPv6 prefixes from the Delegating Router (DR) acting as
   the DHCPv6 server to the Requesting Router (RR) acting as the DHCPv6
   Client.  DHCPv6 servers always maintain authoritative information
   related to their operations including, but not limited to, binding
   data of the delegated IPv6 prefixes, lease data of the delegated IPv6
   prefixes, and binding data of their prefix pools, etc.

   In the scenario of the centralized DHCP server, the Provider Edge
   (PE) routers act as a DHCPv6 relay agents when the DHCPv6 Server
   acting as DR and the DHCPv6 clients acting as RRs are not on the same
   link.  For the reachability purpose, the PE routers always need to
   add or withdraw the route entries directing to each customer network
   in their routing table to reflect the status of IPv6 prefixes
   delegated by the DHCPv6 Server to customer routers (a.k.a.  Routed-RG
   or Routed-CPE), which acts as RRs. (see Section 6.2, [BBF TR-177]).

   When a routing protocol is enabled on the network-facing interface of
   the PE router, all the routes directing to the customer networks are
   advertised in the ISP network.  This will make the number of route
   entries in the routing table on the ISP router to be unacceptable
   huge, so that it is necessary to aggregate the routes directing to
   the customer networks on the PE router.

   Because the prefixes of the customer networks can not guarantee
   always to be valid and continuous, the routing protocol enabled on
   the PE router can not make one aggregated route automatically to
   cover all the prefixes delegated within the prefix pool.  The PE
   router needs other ways to make the aggregated routes.  One way to
   make the aggregated routes is to configure them manually and
   permanently per the provision of the prefix pools, but PE router
   doesn't know the information about the prefix pools when it acts as
   the relay agent.

   This document proposes a new Prefix Pool option for the DHCPv6 reply
   agent implemented only on the PE routers, allowing the server to
   notify the relay agent about the information of prefix pools.  After
   the PE router got the information of the prefix pools, the aggregated
   route entries (e.g., black-hole routes) pointing to each of the
   prefix pools can be added or withdrawn in the routing table of the PE
   router.  The aggregated routes will be advertised into the ISP
   network through the routing protocol enabled on the PE's network-
   facing interface.

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Prefix Pool Option              June 2011


   DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery [RFC5460] specifies a mechanism for bulk
   transfer of the binding data of each delegated prefix from the server
   to the requestor (i.e.  DHCPv6 relay agent), to support the
   replacement or reboot event of relay agent.  In this document, the
   capability of DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery will be extended to support the
   bulk transfer of the binding data of prefix pool for the route
   aggregation.


2.  Terminology and Language

   This document describes new DHCPv6 options of prefix pool and the
   associated mechanism on the relay agent and server.  This document
   should be read in conjunction with the DHCPv6 specification, RFC3315,
   RFC3633, RFC5007 and RFC5460 for a complete mechanism.  Definitions
   for terms and acronyms not specifically defined in this document are
   defined in RFC3315, RFC3633, [RFC3769], [RFC5007] and RFC5460.

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].


3.  Scenario and Network Architecture

   Figure 1 and Figure 2 illustrate two typical cases of the targeted
   network architectures.

                   availability of the prefix pool maintained
                   on the server.

   The codes of the status are defined in the following table.

   Name      Code
   Valid     0
   Released  1
   Reserved  2~255

   The status of 'Valid' in the Prefix Pool option can be used to add
   the prefix pool and the associated aggregated route on the relay
   agent; while the status of 'Released' in the Prefix Pool option can
   be used to withdraw the prefix pool and the associated aggregated
   route on the relay agent.

   If the administrative policy on the server permit and support the
   route aggregation on the relay agent, the status of prefix pool can
   be determined by the delegated prefixes within the associated prefix
   pool.  If there is one delegated prefix within the pool that has
   valid lease, the status of prefix pool will be 'Valid'.  Otherwise,
   the status of prefix pool is 'Released'.  If the administrative
   policy on the server don't permit or support the route aggregation on
   the relay agent, the status of prefix pool will always be 'Released'.


5.  Relay Agent Behavior

   The relay agent who needs the information of prefix pools, must

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Prefix Pool Option              June 2011


   includes Option Request option (OPTION_ORO, 6) to request Prefix Pool
   option from the server, who maintains the status of the prefix pools
   associated to the relay agent itself (Figure 1) or its particular
   customer-facing interface (Figure 2) where receiving the DHCPv6-PD
   message from clients.  The relay agent can include this Option
   Request option for Prefix Pool option in the relay-forward (12)
   message of SOLICIT (1), REQUEST (3), RENEW(5), REBIND (6) and RELEASE
   (8).  The relay agent may also include Prefix Pool option with the
   field values of pfx-pool-len and IPv6-prefix as its preference which
   the relay agent would like the server to return.

   The relay agent should include Interface ID option
   (OPTION_INTERFACE_ID, 18) for the server to identify the relay agent
   itself or its particular customer-facing interface where the prefix
   pool is associated, if the server would not like to use link-address
   specified in the DHCPv6 message encapsulation of relay-forward
   message to identify the interface of the link on which the clients
   are located.

   After received the Prefix Pool option for the relay agent itself or
   its particular customer-facing interface in the relay-reply message
   (13) of REPLY (7) from the server, the relay agent shall add or
   withdraw the aggregated route entry per the status of the prefix
   pool.  If the status of the prefix pool got from the server is
   'Valid', the relay agent shall add an aggregated route entry in its
   routing table, if the same entry has not been added in.  If the
   status of the prefix pool got from the server is 'Released', the
   relay agent shall withdraw the associated aggregated route entry in
   its routing table, if the same entry has not been withdrawn.  If
   there is no route entry directing to the customer network within the
   associated aggregated route, the relay agent shall automatically
   withdraw the aggregated route.

   The relay agent advertises its routing table including the entries of
   the aggregated routes based on the information of prefix pools when
   the routing protocol is enabled on its network-facing interface.

   The Relay Agent (i.e.  Requestor) can use DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery
   [RFC5460] to query the binding data of prefix pools in the 'Valid'
   status from the server.  After established a TCP connection with the
   DHCPv6 server, the relay agent must include Query option
   (OPTION_LQ_QUERY, 44) and set the proper query-type
   (QUERY_BY_RELAY_ID, QUERY_BY_LINK_ADDRESS, QUERY_BY_REMOTE_ID), link-
   address and query-options in the LEASEQUERY (14) message.  The query
   options must include Option Request option (OPTION_ORO, 6) to request
   Prefix Pool option from the server.

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Prefix Pool Option              June 2011


6.  Server Behavior

   Per DHCPv6-PD [RFC3633], if the prefix of the customer network
   requested in relay-forward message of SOLICIT , REQUEST, RENEW,
   REBIND by the Client (i.e.  RR) has valid lease, the Server (i.e.
   DR) will delegate the prefix with the relevant parameters in the
   relay-reply message of REPLY.  In order to give a meaningful reply,
   the server has to be able to maintains the binding data of the
   delegated IPv6 prefixes with the identification of the client.
   Interface ID option (OPTION_INTERFACE_ID, 18) nested in the relay-
   forward message is usually used to identify the access line of the
   client.

   After receiving the Option Request option (OPTION_ORO, 6) to request
   Prefix Pool option in the relay-forward message of PD, the server
   must include Prefix Pool option with the status indicated for the
   associated relay agent itself (Figure 1) or its customer-facing
   interface (Figure 2) in the relay-reply message of PD if the relay-
   forward message of PD received is valid.

   The server may use the link-address specified in relay-forward
   message to identify the relay agent itself or its particular
   customer-facing interface where the prefix pool is associated, but
   the server has to maintain the binding data of prefix pools in
   association with these link-addresses.  To be more readable, the
   server can alternatively use the Interface ID option
   (OPTION_INTERFACE_ID, 18) included in the relay-forward message by
   the relay agent, to identify the relay agent itself (Figure 1) or its
   particular customer-facing interface (Figure 2) where the prefix pool
   is associated.  In order to give a meaningful reply, the server has
   to maintain the binding data of prefix pools in association with the
   information derived from the Interface ID option.

   Per DHCPv6 [RFC3315], the server shall copy the same Interface ID
   option got from the relay-forward message into the relay-reply
   message.

   If the server is set to support the route aggregation on the relay
   agent for the particular prefix pool, the status of this prefix pool
   can be determined by the delegated prefixes within the associated
   prefix pool.  If at least one of delegated prefix in the associated
   prefix pool has valid lease, the server shall set the status of the
   prefix pool to be 'Valid'.  If the lease of each delegated prefix
   within the associated prefix pool got expired, or if the delegated
   prefix in the relay-forward message of RELEASE is the last prefix

   the particular prefix pool, the status of prefix pool will always be
   'Released'.

   When the administrator of the server changes the setting to support
   the route aggregation on the relay agent for the particular prefix
   pool or not, the server may initiates the relay-reply message of
   RECONFIGURE (10) including Prefix Pool option to add or withdraw the
   prefix pool and the associated aggregated route on the relay agent if
   at least one delegated prefix within the prefix pool still has the
   valid lease.

   Note that multiple prefix pools may associate with the same PE router
   implementing relay agent (Figure 1) or its customer-facing interface
   (Figure 2) in the binding table on the server, and the delegated
   prefix is only from one prefix pool.

   After received the LEASEQUERY (14) message from the relay agent with
   the Query option (OPTION_LQ_QUERY, 44) including Option Request
   option (OPTION_ORO, 6) to request Prefix Pool option, the server must
   include the Client Data options (OPTION_CLIENT_DATA, 45) in the
   LEASEQUERY-REPLY (15) and LEASEQUERY-DATA (16) message to convey the
   binding data of the associated prefix pools with the 'Valid' status
   through the established TCP connection per RFC5460.  Each Client Data
   option shall contain Prefix Pool option, and might contain the
   Interface ID option.  In order to be able to give the meaningful
   replies to different type of query, the server has to be able to
   maintain the relevant association of prefix pools with the RELAY_ID,
   link addresses or Remote_ID of the relay agent in its binding
   database.


7.  Security Considerations

   Security issues related DHCPv6 are described in section 23 of RFC
   3315.


8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an option code to Option_Prefix_Pool from
   the "DHCPv6 and DHCPv6 options" registry
   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/dhcpv6-
   parameters.xml).

   Troan, Roberta Maglione, Ted Lemon, for the discussion in the mailing
   list.  Thanks to Christian Jacquenet for pointing out the draft
   should cover one more use case of ISP-Customer network where CPE is
   directly connected to PE.  Thanks to Sven Ooghe for some revison
   after the email review.  Thanks to Shrinivas Ashok Joshi for pointing
   out the draft should cover the robust mechanism against the case of
   reboot.


10.  Changes Log

   If this document is accepted for publication as an RFC, this change
   log is to be removed before publication.

   Rev. -04

   a.  Re-titled the draft to emphasize that the new mechanism with
       DHCPv6-PD is only designed for the PE router.

   b.  Re-write the abstract and some words in the introduction.

   Rev. -03

   a.  Revisions on the behavior of Relay Agent about the automatic
       withdrawal of the aggregated route.

   b.  Re-correct the behavior of Server about the Interface ID option.

   Rev. -02

   a.  Add one more use case of ISP network architecture where CPE is
       directly connected to PE.

   b.  Revisions on the usage of the 'status' field in Prefix Pool
       option.

   c.  Extend DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery (RFC5460) for the new usage.

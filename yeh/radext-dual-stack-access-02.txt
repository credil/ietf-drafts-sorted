                RADIUS Attributes for Dual Stack Access
                 draft-yeh-radext-dual-stack-access-02

Abstract

   This document specifies the RADIUS attributes for IPv4 and IPv6 dual
   stack access, which are intended to be used in the AAA processes for
   the transfer of user's configuration from AAA server to NAS and
   traffic statistics reporting from NAS to AAA server.  The new
   attributes cover a specified user type for NAS to allocate the proper
   resource and employ the right mechanism for the users; and a batch of
   IPv4 and IPv6 traffic statistics for the differentiated accounting
   policies on the AAA server.

1.  Introduction

   IP sessions got from PPPoE can be either dual-stack IPv4/IPv6
   session, IPv6-only, or the legacy IPv4-only session.  Alternatively,
   IP session can also be obtained from IPoE.  The user in the IP
   session could be a host or a customer router (RG-Residential Gateway,
   CE-Customer Edge Router or CPE-Customer Premise Equipment).  In the
   IPv6 relevant part of the session, the customer router usually employ
   DHCPv6-PD to get the delegated prefix for the customer network, while
   its WAN (NAS-facing) interface could be either numbered or unnumbered
   (Section 2.3, [BBF TR-177]).  The WAN interface of the numbered
   customer router can either employ SLAAC to get the prefix for the
   interface or employ DHCPv6 to get the 128bits IPv6 address for
   interface, which acts as the same as the user of IPv6 host.

   There are at least the following types of users that the NAS and the
   AAA server is serveed for:

      IPv4-only - Host
      IPv6-only - Host(Numbered by SLAAC)
      IPv6-only - Host(Numbered by DHCPv6)
      IPv6-only - Customer Router(Unnumbered)
      IPv6-only - Customer Router(Numbered by SLAAC)
      IPv6-only - Customer Router(Numbered by DHCPv6)
      Dual stack - IPv4 Host + IPv6 Host(Numbered by SLAAC)
      Dual stack - IPv4 Host + IPv6 Host(Numbered by DHCPv6)
      Dual stack - IPv4 Host + IPv6 Customer Router(Unnumbered)
      Dual stack - IPv4 Host + IPv6 Customer Router(Numbered by SLAAC)
      Dual stack - IPv4 Host + IPv6 Customer Router(Numbered by DHCPv6)

   The different type of users need the NAS (Network Access Server, PE-
   Provider Edge Router or BNG-Broadband Network Gateway) employ
   different mechanism and allocate different resource for the
   associated processes.  The addresses assigned and the prefixes
   delegated to the customer hosts or routers can not only get from the
   AAA server through attributes in the Access-Accept packets, but also
   can get dynamically from the local address pool or prefix pool on the
   NAS.  That means a new attribute is required here for the right
   indication of the configuration and proper reporting between the AAA
   server and the NAS, which acts as a RADIUS client.

   IP sessions got either from PPPoE or from IPoE can support dual-stack
   users.  It is desired to support either common or separate queues on
   NAS for the IPv4 or IPv6 traffic from the users, while the QoS
   policies for the IPv4 or IPv6 traffic can be differentiated.
   Meanwhile, the NAS is required to support octets counters and packets
   counters for the combined or the separated IPv4 or IPv6 traffic
   (section 9.4, [BBF TR-187]).  After the traffic statistics is

   reported to the accounting server through RADIUS, the accounting
   policies for the IPv4 or IPv6 traffic can be differentiated.  Per the
   section 9.4 of BBF TR-187, the attributes of Acct-Input-Octets, Acct-
   Output-Octets, Acct-Input-Packets, Acct-Output-Packets are
   recommended to use for the combination traffic.  A batch of new
   RADIUS accounting attributes is required here to report the separated
   IPv4 or IPv6 traffic statistics to the Accounting Server.


2.  Terminology and Language

   This document describes some new RADIUS attributes and the associated
   usage on NAS and AAA server.  This document should be read in
   conjunction with the relevant RADIUS specifications, including
   [RFC2865], [RFC2866], [RFC2869], [RFC3162] and [RFC4818] for a
   complete mechanism.  Definitions for terms and acronyms not
   specifically defined in this document are defined in RFC2865,
   RFC2866, RFC2869, RFC3162 and RFC4818.

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

   The meaning of the above table entries is as follows:

   0    This attribute MUST NOT be present.
   0+   Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present.
   0-1  Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present.
   1    Exactly one instance of this attribute MUST be present.
   1+   One or more of these attributes MUST be present.


6.  Security Considerations

   Security issues related RADIUS are described in section 8 of RFC2865
   and section 5 of RFC3162.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign 13 new Attribute Types code in the
   "Radius Types" registry (http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types
   for the following attributes:

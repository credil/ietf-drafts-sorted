               Deprecation of BGP AS_SET, AS_CONFED_SET.
                   draft-wkumari-deprecate-as-sets-01

Abstract

   This document deprecates the use of the AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET
   types of the AS_PATH in BGPv4.  This is done to simplify the design
   and implementation of the BGP protocol and to make the semantics of
   the originator of a route more clear.

Internet-Draft      AS_SET, AS_CONFED_SET deprecation     September 2010


1.  Introduction

   The AS_SET path segment type of the AS_PATH attribute ([RFC4271],
   Section 4.3) is created by a router that is performing route
   aggregation and contains an unordered set of ASs that the update has
   traversed.  The AS_CONFED_SET path segment type ([RFC5065]) of the
   AS_PATH attribute is created by a router that is performing route
   aggregation and contains an unordered set of Member AS Numbers in the
   local confederation that the update has traversed (AS_CONFED_SETs are
   very similar to AS_SETs, but are used within a confederation).

   By performing aggregation, a router is, in essence, combining
   multiple routes into a new route.  This type of aggregation blurs the
   semantics of what it means to originate a route.  These can cause
   operational issues that include reachability problems and traffic
   engineering issues.

   From analysis of past Internet routing data it is apparent that
   aggregation that involves AS_SETs is very seldom used in practice on
   the public network and, when it is, often contains reserved AS
   numbers ([RFC1930]) and / or only a single AS in the AS_SET.  The
   reductions in table size provided by the aggregation is outweighed by
   additional complexity in the BGP protocol and confusion regarding
   what exactly is meant by originating a route.

2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   Deprecate:  To mark (a component of a software standard) as obsolete
         to warn against its use in the future so that it may be phased
         out.

4.  Deployment and modification of behavior

   It is expected that initially AS_SETs / AS_CONFED_SETs will be
   deprecated by the few operators that are currently generating them,
   and operator policy changed to filter them.  Operators should take
   note that new technologies (such as those that make use of the RPKI)
   MAY not support routes with AS_SETs / AS_CONFED_SETs in them, and MAY
   treat as infeasible routes containing them.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains no IANA considerations.

6.  Security Considerations

   By removing support for the AS_SET path segment type of the AS_PATH
   attribute future BGP implementations can be simplified..  This will
   also simplify the design and implementation of the RPKI and systems
   that will rely on it.  By removing corner cases we remove complexity
   and code that is not exercised very often, which decreases the attack
   surface.
